0,"I was in possession of this car for 6 months. In those 6 months the hood stopped working, the door locks and the CD player stopped working, the interior started rattling and squealing, and the gas gauge broke. That was an NBC from 2007! If you are thinking about buying this car, please keep looking. Maybe a Mini? Believe me when I say: GREAT CONCLUSION! If you already have one... good luck!",0
1,"We bought this vehicle in Jan after months of searching. Had a 6-cylinder Ford Windstar minivan and wanted SUV style without the high cost and poor fuel economy. After 3300 miles, as other reviewers began to hear rattling noises in the driver's side, as well as hesitation in accelerating. Returned at 8500 miles, and it was said that a new gearbox was needed! They had to replace others. I got the car back just 3 days ago, and it's still hesitating, but it's gone, for now. I loved this car, but I'm not sure it will last for many more years. Don't roll down the two rear windows as air pressure / noise is terrible.",0
2,"I bought the Kia Optima a year ago - this is my third Kia. About a week before the switch cable came off and nearly crashed into a car when I parked, I received a greeting card from the dealer. The dealer inspected the cable and said that they had never seen anything like it before - nothing was broken or damaged, the cable just came off. Now, almost a month later, I'm driving with the shotgun in my husband's truck because the cable has ""come off."" I seriously believe that this model has a design flaw and am just glad I never tried to use the switch function - imagine the cable would ""come off"" at 75 miles per hour on the motorway!",0
3,"I have a 2007 Nissan versa, I have startup problems, very intermittent, turn the key over for about 10 seconds, just crank and don't start, my wife is embarrassed when she tries to start it as well, plus I have sensors with weatherproof stripes falling off the back doors in the same place, not too impressed by the mileage of the petrol engine as what's on the sticker.",0
4,"I was so excited about the redesigned 2007 Passat Wagon! What a mistake! I've had this car THREE times since I bought it in March 2006. The engine malfunction keeps flashing up and the dealer can't find the problem except to say that there's an evaporator leak he can't fix. The service manager also explained that he had several Passats that did this. Please don't think the dealer will help you with these problems; YOU WON ""T... I wrote a letter to VW and they weren't willing to help me either. Volkswagen will NOT stand behind your vehicle. Nor will the brakes squeak. Don't buy this vehicle.",0
5,"I've loved Chevrolets and GMCs for 30 years. My 03 Chevy Silverado was the best truck I've ever had. My 08 GMC was the most disappointing truck I've ever bought. I get alarms all the time, including: parking assist off, airbag, low tires when they're not. In addition to the alarms the dealer can't fix, I've had two interior fans replaced, and they rattle again. The engine is tapping even though I'm taking the recommended action. ABS brakes look like I'm on ice on a dry road. Cheaper braking system. Discs already warped. My o3 brakes were 144K miles wide. The sun visors aren't wide enough to block the sun.",0
6,"I currently have one for a company car. Nearly 70,000 in 2 years. Vehicle has plenty of power to move around on busy roads, interior is nicely laid out (I have automatic climate control). No SYNC on previous models. Decent fuel economy on such a larger vehicle. Styling is nice, even after 70,000 miles, it's still nice to look at. Fever-feverish problems: Check your hood! Corrosion on the bonnets is a MAJOR problem. I've seen over half with corrosion problems. OEM tires are terrible! I'm currently in the third set, now driving GoodYear Integrity tires. Better ride, better wear. Poor manufacturing standards; doors not exactly lining up, hood misalignment etc. Front brakes wear prematurely.",0
7,"I am very disappointed with this purchase, the paint has burst and continues to bubble on parts that had been repainted before, which sounds like you need new breaks, all within 3 months of purchase. Headlights had to be replaced completely, washing liquid leaks from the hood, the rear paint fell off and again everything bubbles with 6 months of ownership of the vehicle. If you own the old sage, please go over it and check for bubbles of pinhead paint. It squeaks like an old truck on very hot days and long drives in stop-and-go traffic, has no pickup truck, the dashboard color is reflected on the windshield, which is a bit distracting. I will never buy a Mazda.",0
8,"I bought my first Honda after doing a lot of research on the fuel economy of cars. I bought it new with six miles on it and had problems with it drifting to the right. I already had it four times. The first time they had a front adjustment that had failed. It was still pulling to the right. When they came back that day, they changed the tires from back to front and said it was a radial train and they put all the new tires on it. It was drifting on and now they tell me it was the road and all the Hondas drifting to the right. It never moves to the left. Also, they scratched my paint when visiting with their free laundry. Very unfortunate!!!",0
9,"I've had my cobalt for a little over a year now, it's a fun little car, but I was expecting more. I added new rims / tires and a new exhaust because the exterior was reasonably plain. The interior looks really cheap, Chevy needs a major interior upgrade. I've yet to see what the mileage Chevy promises looks like, a little frustrating. I'd say it's a good entry-level car, but not really able to compete with other cars in the same category, it just falls short.",0
10,"I recently had a problem with the car, so the air conditioner was just blowing hot air. A visit to the dealer showed an undetected leak in the coolant of the system. They couldn't find the leak after 4 hours and put a dye in the refrigerant to try to find the leak. I've never had this problem with a Japanese vehicle. Has anyone else had this problem? I'm supposed to drive the car now for three months and return the vehicle to ""discover"" the leak.",0
11,"First we loved this car, then the problems started. Twice I had it fitted because of leaking doors from the drain pipes of the sunroof, soon it will be installed again. Seats are ruined by water damage. If we replace the stay holders, recall the wiper blades, we seem to be unable to repair the popping noises underneath. We are very upset, and also the car does not even make it to our driveway because of the gravel. It stinks of front-wheel drive! We wish we would never act. I feel cheated. This car is a lemon!!",0
12,It's the most uncomfortable car I've driven. I'm at just over 600 miles and only get 25 mpg on the highway! I've been researching for months and thought I was making a smart purchase decision. I'm not going to buy another one.,0
13,"I think you get a lot for your money, but I have only had my car changed for a year and 6 months and I already have the left front and right front axle and a door handle that fell off a passenger visor. I also had to have my air conditioner replaced because of peeling and now I am waiting for a door lock controller and a headlight on the right. I wonder how much I will have to spend after the 2-year warranty if I have to endure these frequent workshop visits without even having an accident and owning a new car. I would suggest a different car. I am thinking of the new Audi crossover Hyundia. By the way, I hate the unstable cup holders, cheap fans.",0
14,"If I had known then what I know now, I would never have gotten this Buick LaCrosse. This Buick has been to the dealer 5 times because of ONE problem, something with the steering column. I got an extended warranty from Buick, but that didn't work. It still doesn't work properly. The car goes back for lap six and the SAME EAT. I never drive American cars again. Thank you Buick for making such great American products. HA",0
15,"This car is smoke and mirrors. It is slow, uncomfortable, gets poor gasoline performance and is overpriced. Paid 45K for a car and must tolerate 17 phone dummy switches because the car has no Bluetooth? Frankly, research BMW, Saab, Audi before buying this brand. I would return the car tomorrow if I could. Every day I go to this vehicle and wonder why I paid so much for a car with so little? Mercedes Benz must make about 20 big profits with each of these ""very, very average"" cars.",0
16,"I have had problems with this car since the day we drove it home from the dealer. After 4 months of trying to deal with Nissan, we still have no one who really takes responsibility to repair or replace this car. We have waited weeks for calls. We have a brand new car that we don't want to drive and no one seems to know how to fix it. Nissan also ignores the service department of the dealer who is trying to repair this car.",0
17,"Bought as a replacement when I destroyed my 07'saturn vue. 08' Lucerne CX, it was a dealer demo with about 2,400 miles on it. In the first month, I heard a rattle / humming from the front area. Brake light stayed on until I went to the dealer for repair. Dealer replaced a fuel line problem because there was a GM bulletin on it. So far, I've had the car in 5 times because of the rattle and still rattled / buzzing. I'm ""disillusioned"" with this Buick. I'll try rattle repair again... then I'll contact GM personally. (You probably won't care / or react to it) The dealer understands my problem anyway. I'll buy Honda next time.",0
18,"After the first month in possession of this enclave, there was nothing but trouble. Since June 08, we had two software updates for the gearbox (trans gear still terrible. Pretend not to know which gear it should be in). The rear lid opens automatically (if the car is fortunately off). When the automatic mode is off, we still hear the elevator engine turn on. The heat control stopped working twice. Sometimes, all the indicators read as if the car was off. At 75 MPH for almost two hours, the best MPG I get is 17. In town, it's a good day to get 13 MPG. The dealer tries his best, but I don't think there's much time for improvement.",0
19,"The first time this happened on Thanksgiving Day! Had to have the SUV towed from the gas station, the manual hand brake function did not work. Just today I went shopping and the parking brake malfunction continued! Had to wait over 2 hours for the tow truck. No other option but to have the SUV towed. Very cumbersome! And has to wait until Monday until the dealer opens! Even more inconvenient! Also, I had to change two tires twice for nail plates, extended flats cannot be repaired, spent over $1000! A tire changed, SUV not even one month old! Not safe for long drives! DO NOT BUY!",0
20,"I am sad to say that I have just had an accident with my cobalt from March 2008. My cobalt and a mini-van collided at a very low speed and my car had $7,700 worth of damage. I could not believe how bad the damage was at low speeds of less than 25 miles per hour. Airbags did not deploy. It was at an intersection with residential buildings. I have another 4 years left after taking out a 5-year loan. I am very angry about everything. I will not buy another cobalt if it is available.",0
21,"I am a car transporter. My maximum weight is 20,000 lb. I have 19,000 (5 months) miles on the truck with 3 weeks in business for repairs to the cooling system. It was difficult to do business with any kind of performance.",0
22,I bought this car brand new on 23 / 05 / 07. After 2 months I called the dealer and said I was dissatisfied with the mpg. I paid extra for the CVT gearbox to get 33 / 36 mpg. Any day (even if I use synthetic oil) my best speed is 30 mpg. He said no one twisted my arm to buy the car. (no wonder Nissan tore its contract from this dealer.) Upholstery is rubbed where the child seat sometimes sits. Carpet where the clutch would be if it was manual looks like I took a razor. Mold on the rear right pane comes off. Air conditioning no longer works shortly after the warranty. They will not help to repair a / c system on a 2 year old car. Too bad that I would upgrade to murano in 2 years.,0
23,"The worst mistake I have ever made when buying a car. It is a really nice car, but that's it. The purely plastic interior smells like cheap. At the windshield you lean into the steering wheel to see when the red light changes. No console and thus no proper storage space. The smallest thing you put on the dashboard is very missing. The seats are uncomfortable. The space between you and the passenger is almost non-existent. Really cramped feeling. No console between seats and cup holders is the worst thing I have ever seen in a vehicle. The armrest sits too low to have any use.",0
24,"Loved the car for the first 15K, then the problems started. Strut, valve body, alignment (still not repaired and the dealer does nothing about it), windshield wiper fluid tank had to be replaced, horn failure, the rear window came out of track. That's too many problems for someone who takes good care of his car. Besides, it BURN oil! after 5k of the recommended 10k oil change intervals I am over 2qts low, VW says this is normal? I have just under 25k in the car and have decided to say goodbye. I could not have imagined this, the car was for the first 15K PERFECT... when buying a used car pay attention to the alignment problem, very soon I am told.",0
25,"Nice looking truck, but far too many serious problems in two years. SW issue that causes the battery to run out if the battery is drained with this particular problem, then call a flatbed. Seal leak on the front right axle (can't really be fixed as this is a design problem... just replace the same gasket if it leaks!) failure of the 4WD driver. Failure of the front distribution box... Special order for needed parts. Rear plastic bumper loses ""shape"" on the bottom within a year... looks very cheap. Very frustrating.",0
26,"I now have 5 Ford F-250 or Ford F-350 diesel trucks. I tow trailers and use my trucks to work every day. I loved all of my Ford trucks until 2008. This truck is scrap. The 2005 Ford F-350 was one of the best trucks I ever owned. It had tremendous power and fuel performance that pulled my 48 ""trailer the way I drive with about 11 mpg. The 2008 model gets 5.9 mpg. I had two radiators replaced. The exhaust system had numerous repairs where most dealers did not know what to do. It repeats itself idle with my foot on the brake clean and will lag forward. Ford continues to tell me that it will not do this. I have discussed this issue with Ford, I am tired of Ford.",0
27,"I had nothing but problems with the fuel system with which I contacted Dodge, and they know about the problems but refuse to fix them. I was told I could watch a DVD if I had any questions, the problem arose with Blue Tech, after I bought the truck (with all the blue techs) to fix it, you have to dive for 45 minutes without going under 45 km / h and under 2000 rpm per week, and they give the truck terrible wear and tear for no reason. I tell everyone I know not to buy Dodge, because if something goes wrong, it's your fault to buy their product if you don't have the time to buy a Ford or Chevy for no reason.",0
28,"I drove my Corolla for a year with the impression that it feels like a big car and has a very gentle feel (in fact, the softest ever), then something broke and the dealer was unable to fix it. Now, I don't feel safe on the highway, because if I hit even a small bump (and especially a series of small bumps), it feels like I'm losing control. At slower speeds, it's just uncomfortable to drive on anything but the slightest roads. The dealer claimed to replace the front braces, and maybe they did because it seemed to reduce the rough feel for a day or two.",0
29,"When I first saw the car, I fell in love with it. Since then, I wish I could divorce! Terrible rattling, squealing and poor workmanship. The car has been in business here and there for over 15 days. I know that VWs are known for their excellent workmanship, but this car has loose dashboards, the black paint bubbling and peeling off the release / locking buttons. Maybe it's my lemon, but I would never recommend VW to anyone! I just hope my bonus is big enough to trade in this piece of garbage! Too bad that something that looks so good is so bad!",0
30,The repair problems caused me to get rid of this car after only having it for 10 months. It seems as if it is hard to hold before it falls apart. I have never been unlucky enough to ever get a car like this.,0
31,"I've had my automatic Fit Sport for about 1 1 / 2 years and wouldn't recommend it. Gas output in the city is only about 28. Air conditioning throttles engine power and can't keep cool in the heat of the AZ summer - gets warm, cold, warm, cold. Interior upholstery is a lint magnet. Biggest downside - car is loud and rattles all over, with a big rattle in the dashboard. If you had that from the start, the service can't fix it. Visibility is poor with huge dead spots on the front and very hard to see when reversing, especially if you're short like me. Tires go low in the air, alignment goes down slightly, the engine makes a high sound, the service says they ""can't hear it."" The same applies to friction noise when turning left.",0
32,"It looks good, performs poorly. The mileage of the gas is 20-21 mpg city and 23 mpg highway. CRV has squealing and rattling in the car. Vehicle shifts roughly from 1st to 2nd place of stop, start and go. The dealer says it is in electronic program transmission. CRV pulls hard to the right on the road at low / high speeds. I was at a Honda dealer who says that there is a Honda Service Bulletin since 01 / 2007 before buying the car and that later new steering column rods / pins need to be installed, which can be ordered again from Honda, so that a proper wheel alignment can be done on a new car, right?) I was never notified before or after buying from the dealer, so be warned.",0
33,This van is louder than my 1-ton truck. Dealer said that they all sound like that. Interior gets slightly dirty and scraped. Van doesn't get much more mpg. Than my 1-ton 4-WD truck.,0
34,"I was even a faithful Chrysler man in the 1970s / when ""build quality"" was just a word in the Chrysler dictionary. By and large, I'm unhappy with this vehicle. I should have got the Hemi because it couldn't drink more gasoline than this 3.7. This vehicle gets the worse fuel economy of any other vehicle I've ever owned or driven. It's also energy efficient, so if you're going to make a pass, you'd better plan ahead and allow plenty of space.",0
35,"Really bad design, because the buttons are not sealed and fail with only a few drops. Audi will not lag behind. Costs $1000 for replacement in the first 6 months. Fear of using the cup holders that are above the chosen one. 2 drops and another $1000. Coil the hassle. Want my Range Rover back.",0
36,"If I had bothered to check if this trash can had depreciated $15,000 in 3 years, I would have come across this car. Unfortunately, I did not, and now I have the pleasure of fixing all the KNOWLEDGE GM design problems on steering column, brake rotors, steering bar and strut. I had 1960-era cars with better steering and suspension systems. Of course, because GMC is an American company, it is based on greed, not customer service; they refuse to fix / recall any of these problems because not enough people have died in the car. I look forward to the day when I can unload this lemon!",0
37,"I bought this piece of American scrap in 08. Until now, the doors had to work, the heater / air conditioner engine only works with interruptions, the dealer can of course not find a problem. I just finished the front brakes at 23,000 miles. I suspect the use of inferior materials, bad acceleration on the highway, frozen calipers on the rear brakes and the dealer tells me that it could take a week until they come. My hope is that Chrysler disappears from business. I will never buy another.",0
38,"This is my second Mini. The clutch went out in the first after 2 1 / 2 years and only 22,000 miles. The cause was found to be a manufacturing fault and was covered. My 2008 Mini S has only 10,727 miles and is also a standard gearbox. The clutch slipped on this. It is currently at the dealer and I am waiting to see if the repairs are covered. I do not drive the clutch and do not drive aggressively or even need to shift as often (not much stop-and-go traffic). I have read many posts on other sites about Minis and clutch problems. Buyers beware!!!",0
39,"I bought this brand new 2008 LE V6 in late 2008. Within a week, the seat and steering wheel vibrated when driving 65-75 miles on the highway to get to work. Also had problems with the Bluetooth. Turned on multiple times. Finally, a TSB was sent out by Toyota after months of complaints regarding vibrations / shivers, but it did not completely solve the problem. Toyota Rep insists that it is the way Camry is constructed. If Honda had been the first Tokota for 20 years, incredibly disappointed. Don't feel safe.",0
40,"From day one we had a constant smell of gas. We took it inside and half a tank of gasoline later could not find a problem. Used to drive it and the smell got worse. Mpg Highway was around 18, City at best 15. Winter was terrible because it would get stuck in 1 / 2 inch of snow. We had the pebble leather and it reflected very poorly in the windshield.",0
41,"I love this car... Now I can't wait to return it! It seems like the problems are only getting worse. Airbag light is always on... I'm tired of having to fix it. Electric windows seem to have their own head. Then, the windshield wipers, say, I had to change the engine. Now, I have an epc start problem... Nobody seems to understand that. After reading all these reviews, my brake pads are worrying... I guess it will never end until I get rid of this car: (",0
42,"I've been driving this car for 3 months now. I average 22.5 MPG in most suburbs, with a round trip of 20 miles a day to work. I also use it to deliver papers every morning, which takes about 30 minutes. I'm driving the same routine in a Honda Civic that had a bigger engine and got 30 MPG, so I'm very disappointed with the fuel economy. Even in the open road you can see the throttle gauge falling visibly, you can only lock the driver's side with the key - that's a pain when you're carrying bundles and / or it's raining.",0
43,The first Highlander of the year 2001 was better than my 2008. Poor visibility. Seat is so uncomfortable that you can not drive for long. 2008 does not cope as well as the previous model. No traction in the snow. Mine is a four-wheel drive with 6 cylinders. Interior parts fall off. Very disappointed with the Highlander of the year 2008.,0
44,"I will never buy a VOLVO again. On this car the engine was replaced, new brakes, roof squealed and the main computer went off. The car is 2 years old and has only 10,000 miles The biggest waste of $49,000!!!",0
45,The bells and whistles could be of better quality. Not enough power. The gearbox seems to have trouble finding the gears. My control engine lights up three times. The most frustrating thing is that the car is leaking when it rains! The car is rusting outside now. The car has been serviced three times and they still haven't repaired it properly.,0
46,"I bought this XD with the Trans car, that was the first mistake. This thing scares me the hell while I'm trying to interfere with the 70km / h traffic. Road noise is excessive and the ride is pretty bumpy. Brakes are sufficient but spongy. Highway mpg is not too bad at 38, but local driving is dismal 23mpg. Rear passenger space is surprisingly sufficient for average-sized people. Rear storage space is small, but this is a subcompact and is to be expected. The hubcaps had to go. I bought 7 spoke wheels that look much better.",0
47,"The doors had a good, solid feel. This is the first car that made me sick as a driver when the car rolled around in fast corners. I averaged only 28 km / h on the highway with the Sentra. This was probably due to the ride height, the springy gas pedal and the CVT gearbox. Nissan still needs to improve its workmanship. Plastic looked like it came from a branded toy. The bottom line is that you can get better driving dynamics, quality, fuel economy or value with a Corolla, Civic or Mazda3.",0
48,"I did some research and discounted the Fit, Yaris etc. in favor of the Versa bc with horsepower, space and the reputation of Nissan. At first it exceeded all my expectations - fun to drive, reliable, good fuel economy, easy to use. Then came winter. In cold, wet weather I went to the car and found ice all over the dashboard, the controls and inside the windows and windshields. The controls did not work and the doors did not close. Warm up - no change. Repairing it at the dealer proved extremely problematic, it did not happen - the repair cost for me was quoted at 5-10K. I just swapped it for a 2009 model - hoping for better this time. It will probably be my last Nissan too.",0
49,"I bought this 10 months ago and am looking to trade it in, even though I know I will make a los. has tons of cargo space and legroom, but the engine works too hard. Doesn't feel like it shifts properly. Not very darty--takes a long time to accelerate. Gas mileage for me has been constant at 18 miles and less. I've never even gotten 19 miles per gallon as stated. 14 gallon tank is small - feels like I'm always at the gas station. radio and amenities are well positioned for a comfortable ride. Great heat and air conditioning, but it's hard to hear radio about it - no strong speakers.",0
50,"This corvette was a nightmare. Firstly, the top creaked in the heat and was in business four times and still unrepaired. Both front stabilizers had to be replaced and the entire sprocket and rack had to be replaced, the driver's floor had to be replaced and the battery had to be replaced. Problems simply persist and with a car that costs so much, I would have expected better quality.",0
51,"The maintenance is free, but if they don't fix anything, it's worthless. The workshop is not familiar with the car and can't fix problems. I had to drive back four or five times before something was repaired. They even lied, actually repaired something and said on the repair sheet that nothing was wrong. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this car with an automatic, the rear view is confusing and very dangerous to secure it. The automation in the controls is stupid, mostly unnecessary and very annoying.",0
52,"This is my first Jeep. I bought it because of the price and fuel consumption. We had a snowy winter, and it keeps well in the snow. I have a toddler, so the plastic backrest on the seats and the YES fabric work great. Controls are in strange places, and that took getting used to. Window noises from the rear windows are annoying. Seats are uncomfortable, and the armrest is terrible, cup holders very uncomfortable. For the second time in a month, the electric windows fail. All four windows get stuck, the controls work after repeated effort. The rear driver doesn't react, gets stuck. In zero-degree weather with a toddler a real problem. Today, he did it again - think about the trade...",0
53,"Undetectable rattling & bumps in the interior and rough pavement. Balky starts at a standstill - drivers who are new to the car are always stuck in traffic jams. Seat belt alarms make you howl six times if you don't fasten your seat belt before starting the car, so you first have to open the door with the key, take off the key, fasten it, then pick up the key and start the car. Forget about it and you'll be punished by ugly noises. There's no sound insulation at all - hear any noise in wheel arches. The rear seat backrest mechanism to get into the rear doesn't go back into position, so the backrearches need to be adjusted every time. NO UMBLE SUPPORT. Subaverage directional stability. This car stinks.",0
54,"I am a bit disappointed with my 07 SI sedan. I had several problems with it. Tons and tons of rattles in the interior that can never be repaired are buzzing in the speakers, and now my second gear is grinding like crazy. Problems in second and third gear are VERY common with these cars, and I now have difficulty pressing second gear at high revs where the SI lives. It's fun to drive, even though it doesn't deliver what it should be for its price. At almost 5k cheaper you get the cobalt-colored SS / ion redline with more power. For just 1-2 thousand more you get the mazdaspeed3 / GTI, which has a lot more spunk and sophistication. I would suggest trying the Mazdaspeed3 / gti before buying the Honda, unfortunately.",0
55,"In 3 mo 13,000 miles and 400 gal = 32.5 mpg that's 95% hwy. I've got 27 mpg in one tank to 43 mpg in another tank. Most tanks average 30-32 hwy driving on the flat side from Raleigh nc to the nc coast. My best hwy mpg has been driving Raleigh nc west to winstone-salem nc. I've had it to dealers 4 times and they say computer said that everything works properly. I got the car for the high mpg. Gas prices are my enemy. I owed a 91 citizen and got 37 mpg. Wish I still had it.",0
56,"It's a nice vehicle, but here's the bad stuff. Heat takes about 10 minutes to turn it on, every time you turn the air conditioner on, it defaults to air conditioning (the most annoying feature). If you have the Bo speaker system, your subwoofer is mounted on the spare tire, so be ready to take it off if you have collapsed on the roadside. Apart from the fact that I like everything else about the car, I know from a review that it doesn't have fog lights, but mine, it took me a while to find it. Headlights are also adjustable when they look weak. Upgraded sound system sounds fantastic, and it has XM radio! Dealers, sellers and bestsellers who have installed my XM all didn't know.",0
57,"Had this car for 1 year and what a mistake. Should have stayed without Hyundai Accent, but they had no 4dr hatch. Had a problem with a constant speed sensor on the Auto-Trans. The car is slow, copes poorly in the snow and has less than good gasoline performance. Avg 28 combines City / Hywy. Should have better mileage with such a small engine.",0
58,"I was expecting more from this car. I've been driving it for about 9 months now, the engine has to be broken in now, but the mileage is terrible. Hardly 400km on the tank and that's 50 / 50 city, hiway. I'm not driving that hard either. My friends with domestic v6's get something like that close. It's fun to drive, somehow I like a go-kart, but because of all the little things I'm thinking of swapping it for something else. Auto-Tranny also doesn't work for this underpowered engine, there are too many downshifts at the slightest trace of throttle. I wish I'd done more research instead of being dazzled by the fact that it was a new Honda. By the way, the orange color doesn't work too well for this car.",0
59,"The result? Complete brake overhaul of calipers, discs and brake pads, which all needed replacing. Dealers said there was no reported problem, although I showed them pages and pages of customer complaints about the brakes. I did this out of my own pocket for the safety of my family. Now, before the warranty expires, the gearbox slips. We went to the dealer and said there was a recall and the problem was fixed? Wrong? Today, woman had to go back to the dealer, $95 dollars to look at it as it is no longer under warranty. Rental out of my pocket and the result is still TBD...... Terrible experience.",0
60,"But this time I promise never to buy another piece of c * * p from Chrysler again! Outdated engine and transmission. Wooden car ride and handling, really bad mileage from the age-old design of the PUSHROD engine that has been around since 1989! And let's talk about quality, it's nowhere to be found! Wrong dashboard, bad assembly, inappropriate colors, really bad leather that looks fake in the way it wears and fades. We bought it new and the write-off hit us really hard. Sold for pennies in dollars! Avoid it at all costs, it doesn't even belong in a rental car fleet!",0
61,"I have owned the last three versions of the Grand Prix and each has become more technologically advanced and stylish than the last, while construction quality and interior design have deteriorated. My 2007 Grand Prix pales in comparison to the interior design and materials in my 2000. mesh headliner and sun visor material scream ""cheap."" The plastic interior parts are visually and physically ""hard."" The carpet is coarse and the leather doesn't even smell of leather. Rear end, I am a Grand Prix lover and am embarrassed for GM. It seems as if the Grand Prix should have suffered the same agonizing death as its Pontiac brothers. Sorry GM, my next car will be Japanese.",0
62,"I bought my Mini new in 2 / 08 and the fuel pump ran out at 17,000 miles. Although it was under warranty, I can only guess what problems lie ahead. I also had to replace one of the defective tires worth $249. The car is fun to drive and I have plenty of space as I no longer have to transport small children. However, as soon as I experience a major mechanical failure, I start looking for a new car. I plan to buy a new Honda or Toyota in 2 / 10.",0
63,"This is our second BMW, we are so disappointed with the quality of the construction. The front bumper, a pitiful piece of plastic, just buckled and fell over while driving over a bump. Told by a BMW service representative that this happens so often on the x3 that people don't even bother to fix the bumper, but just drive around with it. It's an unconsciously bad construction, design and quality. There are other issues with the quality of the materials used in building this car. This is definitely our last BMW and if it wasn't a lease I would get rid of it right away.",0
64,"My check engine lights up 3 times since March, two dealers can't find the problem, so they put the computer back and send me on the way. And my leather seat was defective, which was replaced. Did I mention that my Bluetooth was also replaced, and all before the 6,000-mile mark. What a lemon. If you own a Nissan, good luck if you have a warranty problem.",0
65,"We swapped a 2004 Ford Explorer with this car, mainly because of the terrible road noise we had with the Ford. We have a decent new car with almost the same noise level. We didn't notice it during the two test drives as it was extremely windy on both days. The dealer now tells me that this car doesn't have the insulation that is taken into account in the Civic family. We were told that the top end of the Accord and Oddessy would have insulation and be much quieter. Great! Fuel economy isn't great even for a four-cylinder.",0
66,"This Jeep has been leaked since Day 1. It has been repaired 6 times and has been out of service for more than 30 days. I filed a lawsuit under lemon law / and got an intermediary / without solution. 5 months later I was forced to buy a foreign used car so I could get to work. I do not recommend this Jeep to anyone! Chrysler does not support a product, they can certainly sell you a car, but the service is no longer there.",0
67,"When I first drove the car, I fell in love with it and bought it straight away, and the very responsive engine coupled with 18-inch performance tyres made it fun. Just two months later and the clutch feels way too much like a gearbox, and the fuel consumption doesn't even come close to the stated technical specifications. Unless my dealer can solve the fuel consumption problem, I estimate that this car will cost me $400-500 more per year than I should expect based on the estimates quoted. As for the clutch, the feeling changed drastically when I received the first shipment. My dealer claims that it's running normally. I hope that's not a sign of the future.",0
68,"Too much plastic. Window gearboxes gave up around 2100. Soft as a truck and hard as a sedan - choose one and stick with it if you're GM. Return it to the company headquarters 3,500 miles ago. Give me another bull as a present!",0
69,"My biggest disappointment with this car is the mileage with gasoline. Granted, I am on average about 38 MPG, but nowhere near the stated 51 MPG. I could have bought a Chevy Aveo or Honda Fit for much less money. Quality is surprisingly poor - had to take the car to the dealer several times because of leaks in the flap area. The car is very uncomfortable for long trips - OK for excursions in the city. Seats are very hard and unsupportive. Performance is very fuzzy, especially on highways. If you press too hard, you have the feeling that things are about to break. Great second or third car, but not enough for all-round service.",0
70,"I bought my 2008 Avenger in April 2008. I'm very disappointed about it. I've got 12478 miles on it. Grinding the brakes, doors and side panels swell like crazy... I can't fix this problem, Im in my 4th Mygig radio (continues to freeze). Sluggish Transe (4cyl). Front noises when turning or driving over a bump. AC doesn't work well, numerous blind spots, chrome plastic around the gear lever inside the shutter driver, poorly designed trunk pours water into the trunk when it's wet, and many more that just run out of space. PLEASE DO BUY ONE.JUNK This is just the worst car I've ever owned. 1997 I had a brand new avenger and loved it, so I thought I'd take a chance with the 2008. What a mistake.",0
71,"I loved driving my used 2001 Limited Edition PT Crusier, but in 2007 I had some problems with it, so I decided it was time for a new one. Despite the previous problems I had, I thought I would have no trouble buying a brand new cruiser, so on January 1st, 2008 I bought a brand new cruiser. Do you think it was a pleasure? Not a bit! I had nothing but problems from day one! It was there for balancing three times, the tires were indexed several times, and now it squeals when I run over everything that makes the car bouce. It's so annoying! Body creaking shouldn't happen on a car less than a year old! I'm over my car and I'll never buy a Chrysler again!",0
72,"I bought this car a year ago and was extremely dissatisfied with the performance in winter. If there is less or more than an inch of snow, the car does not move, it just spins. It was also parked on a lawn and had to be towed because it would just stir up mud and not move. I have a brand new radial on this car all year round and yet it cannot get out of its own way. The luggage rack provided by the factory is terrible. I am afraid to put my kayaks on it for fear that the luggage rack is too weak and will break under pressure. It is also not wide enough to accommodate the length of the kayaks.",0
73,I bought the car three months ago and have had it serviced five times in the last month and a half due to a squeaky problem that it causes when I turn it on for the first time in the morning. Very unhappy with the dealer and service technicians in van dyn hoven for not repairing the seemingly simple problem and offering a rental vehicle. Mileage is less than 20 km / h. Sunglasses are too small and do not fit into glasses. The fuel door broke when my husband pushed them with his arm when filling them in. Made of cheap plastic. Headrest and armrest are also uncomfortable for me.,0
74,"I use my Ridgeland SUV a lot. I regularly smell burning grass after driving down dirt roads where grass grows. I had a severe fire in the engine compartment that caused over $5,000 damage. I had another small fire that I extinguished with a garden hose. There is a connection around the exhaust that catches grass and leaves that smolder and / or catch fire. You may remember the Honda advertisement during the last March madness in which a ""herd"" of Ridgelines crossed a field of tall grass. It was a brush fire in the making. This pickup truck is safe in the parking lot of the mall, but don't go near the grass. Honda hasn't responded.",0
75,"After several very positive experiences with Toyota, I had a downer. Obviously, the more Toyota grows, the more it has taken some quality control out of its vehicles. I have 6k miles on me and have an off-and-on noise that happens at 75-80 (the dealer can't diagnose it because he can only drive it up to 70), linkage clatter, clatter of the passenger door and had to be towed because it wouldn't start (thank God I bought the extended service plan, otherwise I would have been really upset if I'd paid for towing a 3-month-old truck). I wouldn't mind a slightly better mileage, but it's not bad. Performance is good for a V6 and comfort is good too. I still like it, wish it were better.",0
76,"The power steering is jittery, they have also mounted the ski stand incorrectly and the bike stand is too high on the car to even put a bicycle there. This car is nothing but trouble and bad design. Also, the extended warranty has about 3 sides of what it doesn't cover, and only 1 paragraph of what it covers, and maybe if you use the $1000 dollar warranty, it can now cover a radio if you're lucky. When I got my car back from the dealer, it seems like the SUV didn't even work.",0
77,"It slows down too fast when the foot is taken off the accelerator. Sooner or later, I will fall behind. I am now in arbitration proceedings. I was told by a Toyota that the technology should drive aggressively, which is against the law. I now have to answer to an arbitration tribunal.",0
78,"I bought a 2008 Dodge Caliber last October within a month of buying it. The gearbox is terrible. Whenever I could stop or start, it jolts and jolts as if it were about to stop. Apparently, some calibers have this problem, others don't. Besides, they said that there is no solution! Then I went back to have the front strut replaced and look again and again and change without a solution! Now the problem seems to happen when driving backwards. I'm really not happy with this vehicle.",0
79,"I always buy AWD, but thought FWD would be fine and thought a slight increase in fuel consumption would be good. Wrong! This car doesn't get out of the way in the snow. It's so heavy at the back that the front tires don't have any weight. Forget about pulling on the road after a blizzard. MPG is 15.5 at best. You get close to 24 on the highway if you don't exceed 65 km / h. All in all, 15.5 is not 16-24 that they advertise. I'm a sad consumer if two of the three reasons I bought it were fraud.",0
80,"This car has repetitive computers, ohm knobs, the air conditioner replaced, the cup holder jammed in the dashboard, the boot is leaking, the engine already has a ""knock noise."" It was literally in business almost as much as in my garage. Can't repair it in time because they don't seem to manufacture the parts until there's a problem. If it's a car you need to rely on, don't buy it. If you have the patience to work with the mechanics, do it, it's nice, but I'd recommend waiting until the next line comes out, my car seems to be a ""beta"" trial.",0
81,"At the age of 54, this was my first ever new car... ever! Everyone said what great cars Hondas are, so I was excited to buy one of them, and on top of that my beloved item. At 1000 miles, it was in business twice because of fuel sensor problems. Now, at just one year and only 5700 miles, I'm really disappointed. It's fun to drive and I love its funny cool nerd look, but the quality is really missing.... little irritations: there's no defroster, radio speakers vibrate from the start, the side doors rattle. I'm a single old guy, so it was hardly treated crudely.",0
82,"I loved this great looking car on the road! I loved it, loved it, loved it! Until I bought it! I was very disappointed from day one! I felt every tiny bump on the road, the steering wheel is very tight, so it's not particularly easy to manoeuvre. I also couldn't get the seat into a comfortable position and suffered from back pain until I got used to it. I'm 5.6 ""and I think this car is not for the quick-witted. Mom, watch out! The metal anchors are so low that it took me about 20 minutes to assemble the car seat!",0
83,The lock on my driver's door keeps loosening and making a snarling noise as I ride over even the smallest bumps. The dealer has repaired it 5 times and the noise has come back. I am in the process of taking the car to an arbitration court in Lemon to force the dealer to give me my money back. Jim in MA,0
84,"I preferred the C70 to an Audi because of the hardtop. I've had it in business seven times and 90 days since May '08 due to roof problems. Fortunately, none of these problems were major, but a big inconvenience for my time. My biggest problem was getting someone from the Volvo Group to call me to discuss any solution.",0
85,"But it's a mechanical nightmare. This truck looks, drives and feels like it was assembled in a hurry. I only have 2500 miles on it and the trans jerks like a horse at least three times a day. Cadillac has reprogrammed some computer, but it keeps doing it and they say there's nothing they can do to fix it. It also runs very rough idle, in the first month when we had it, it was fine and now it vibrates so strongly at the traffic lights that it's embarrassing. Cadillac told me to use premium, and it still does. Sometimes the lift doesn't want to work. Should have got an 08 Sequoia.",0
86,"We were so happy when we bought our Acadia. Great looks, performance and a solid feeling. After we bought the car, we learned how poor the fuel consumption was. I also noticed the hesitation uphill. Gas reaction is terrible when you step on it. At 8,000 miles the engine light turned on. Service center informed us that fuel cap and camshaft had problems? Camshaft? Only 8,100 miles with this car.",0
87,"After a year of testing and testing various SUVs and crossovers, we decided on the HH and ordered exactly what we wanted. We had tested several HH and other hybrids and all were quiet, but none impressed us like the HH. When our HH came in, we were thrilled. It was beautiful and had everything we wanted except the noise! When we brake to brake, it sounds like a jet engine spinning down. It also has a click. We expected the calm we had experienced with the other HHHs, but were very disappointed. The dealer told us that some hybrids have this sound more than others - it's normal. I won't order again. I buy what I drive on the property.",0
88,"My friend bought the van more than a year ago for himself and his children. It was sold with the ""safety feature"" that any obstacle would automatically open the side door. Since then, we have had constant problems with the electric doors - at any kind of inclination, the electric doors have a great chance of not closing and not slipping forward by themselves. Indeed, his 9-year-old son had his hand crushed in the doors (which do NOT open automatically) when he reached for his seat belt to fasten when the door closed. His two children are now afraid of the doors closing and warn their friends not to touch the doors. I am nearly 30 and even I get nervous about it.",0
89,"I commute 120 miles a day, so gasoline performance was of paramount importance. I've always owned and liked Hondas - except for this one. The front passenger / driver sun visors are broken three times, the paint blows and flakes off the bumpers, the windshield is VERY long, prone to cracks and the sun visor takes up as little cargo space as there is, the rear child tie rods are so close to the seat that you can't use them. I was informed today that the brakes need to be replaced every 20-25,000 miles, as all have a new braking system in 2008 to eliminate braking noise that leads to 1 / 2 of normal braking life. I'd rather have the noise... and another car. $300 every 8 months is expensive.",0
90,"For the past 9 years I've had an ML320 and been persuaded to swap it for a new Lexus. So I get the RX 350 and all I can say about it is that the fit and finish are great. In terms of rated power it seems to be too weak. I was used to a car that was much heavier, with lower horsepower than this dog. All I can say about the driveability is that it reminds me of an old men's car like the old Buick LaSabre. Very boring and no road feel. If you own an M-Class, hold on to it and appreciate it.",0
91,"We bought this car because we thought we would never have a new car again, because we are retired and we are getting old and will not drive for so many years. The wind noise in this car is so bad that we cannot speak. We have returned it to the dealers several times. First, they said Nissan is working on the problems and to come back in a month, we have done that, after 3 trips to the dealership we get what is characteristic of this car and nothing can be done about it. We are very unhappy with the way we have been treated. I am really not just an old woman trying to get it under control, we have a problem and can't get anyone to help us. All I can say is do is not buy a Nissan Rouge, it is a waste of good money.",0
92,"Let me start by saying I like the van and this is my second one. But the new design has a whistling sound when you do 65-70 MPH. The problem is around the windshield on the unit, between the window and the pillar that reaches up to the roof. The rubber insert is not long enough and it causes a whistling sound. You have to tape the outside until you can run a thin bead of lime under the rubber to prevent the wind from penetrating.",0
93,I bought a Kia Rio sedan in 2008 and it still has a new gearbox that still has problems with reversing automatic gearshift. I sit on the road waiting for the gearbox to shift. I feel this is a safety issue and Kia should fix it after a lot of shopping. They tell me that I don't know I have to drive and that there's nothing wrong with my car. It's the worst car I've ever had and I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy another one.,0
94,"I take it out at least once a month to fix it, mainly with brakes and power steering, the brakes have been replaced twice and four times, the first set of brakes has been replaced at 9,000 miles, the power steering sensor has been repaired once and then replaced once because it would block me while driving. Feel very unsafe in this car, the dealership won't do anything for me. Trying to argue the MI Lemon Law with Pontiac Corp also had tire pressure issues. Let's just say I'll never get a GM again... I'm doing everything I can to get out of this lease!!",0
95,"I bought this Silverado classic ext cab 2wd in October 06 for 25k. Trading value is now 6500. Two reasons, the first is the 4.3 vortec v-6. It is far too weak driven, the gearbox grinds and tries to shift too much between 35-40 mph. I had the gearbox replaced at 30K (unacceptable). I wanted to give GM another chance after driving Ford for so long. I won't do it again. Vehicle drives well and I get about 17.5 mpg through town.",0
96,"The dealer stated that ""it is not uncommon to burn through a Quart or 2 during a break. Funny. The light has been turned on at least eight times. In the last 10K it burned through 12 + qts. The dealer has done pressure tests, completed the test (although they never completed the process as they claimed), checked valve springs for kinks (according to TSB), no oil coming out of the exhaust and no leaks whatsoever. The dealer keeps telling me to drive more miles. No resolution so far. I'm done! Have seen others with the same problem on the Internet. Don't recommend this vehicle & MPG.",0
97,"Sometimes the Trans behaves as if it does not know which gear it should be in, which has a negative effect on the MPG. Currently we are driving 14-15 City and 16-18 Highway. The dealer has installed a software update, but no help. Another update is available, but it would cost me 3-4 MPG and once installed, you cannot undo it! Had 9 other Buicks and loved them all. This car, once you have left its beauty behind, is a big disappointment. Would not recommend until GM permanently fixes the tranny problems. The dealer admits that this is a problem.",0
98,"I just bought a 2008 Commander and I have water seeping through, even if I just wipe the handrails near the window with wipers. Go into speakers. Short, cracking noise, speakers on the right don't work. Who knows where the water is flowing now! Also, you can hear wind through the windshield while driving. Difficult to see through the rear windshield with the rear seats pulled up shouldn't use it. I can't really rate the vehicle as it's only been a month ago, not good so far.",0
99,"I bought a 2007R / T in February. A manager drove it. She now has 6,700 units. She makes a babbling noise from the front. Sometimes, it seems to get louder. Two dealerships called Chrysler and they know the problem? But they don't know what it is and they don't know how to fix it? They say it's safe to drive? How do they know if they don't know what's wrong or fix it?",0
100,"My predecessor, the ESV 2004, had what I thought was a luxury car. 2008 ""s seats are tough, don't hold in position when cornering, the sun visor is bad, the previous model had more flexibility, the headrest's ability to bend forward is seriously lacking now. I was apparently one of the few people who accidentally used the windshield changing system EVERYONE. Since the addition of the rear view camera, this feature has been removed, that last damn thing stopped the purchase. I wish I'd bought a Mercedes GL 550 now, which will be my next purchase at this point, and most likely sooner rather than later. This is my tenth new Cadillac purchase in a row.",0
101,"Poor handling at high speed. Car shakes at high speed. Car seems to float at 80 km / h. Very top heavy in corners. Car tight in corners, loose in the middle and loose in corners. Car performance seems to decrease during the day after driving. Low gear is too high, poor performance at start. Air conditioning fan very low. Door locks should be locked when the car is in gear.",0
102,"Had a ""03, loved it. In terms of specifications, the"" 08 should be even better. It's fine in every way except while driving. If you're fine on a slick blacktop, any other surface you feel over the seat will become tarmac strips, cobblestones, bumps, and if you hit a hole... oh my God! I drive 55 miles of highway a day. I hate the ride every kilometer. Suspension way too stiff for Toyota's luxury flagship, just jar & ruolt. 17 ""wheels don't help either. 16"" means more absorbent rubber and a softer ride. You need to stop building cars to satisfy the specification wishes of some car magazine testers, whose standards are normally track handling, the biggest wheels & plenty of displacement. The Avalon is not a sports car!",0
103,"Our third Audi. It's just not what we expected. Example - the gasoline door feels like a yugo and works like a yugo. Dashboard is right under cup holders and any dirt screws the audio together. $800 for repair and not under warranty. Service has declined dramatically over the years. It feels like they're trying to wrest every penny they can from us at every opportunity. Not much different from most others, but different from our previous experience. I've had it for 1.5 years and seems like there's always something wrong. Engine is great, great on snow. If I had to do it again, I'd get the GL 450 or 550. The Acura is more reliable, but doesn't drive as well and doesn't turn as sharply.",0
104,"I have replaced this car with a Porsche 911 S and believe me, this car is not a Porsche. It is huge for a ""sports car."" A sports car is supposed to be small, powerful and agile. The driving behaviour of the Vette is comparable to an elephant that wants to perform at the Olympics on a suspended beam. Sure, I like the power under the hood. 30 horses with the dual-mode exhaust sound great, but that is about the only thing that is great about this car. Having driven BMW, Z-cars, Porsche and even my Mercedes E350, I am very disappointed with the way this car is handed over and arranged for the money. Can no one in the USA build a ""sports car,"" at least not in the league of the above mentioned.",0
105,"What a disappointment! The first year was fine with the vehicle, but now it is falling apart. In the cold it works badly, if it starts at all. Do not remember to drive in winter weather without snow tires. The alarm is a toast. The electronics is on the brakes. Seat belts do not retract. Weatherwear. Loud lump in the trunk when cornering. Has a violent tremor at closer highway speed. Difficult to find a comfortable driving position. Overall, the most disappointing vehicle we have ever owned! Will never buy a Honda again.",0
106,"I've owned 10 cars in the last 25 years, and the CLS550 is undoubtedly the biggest disappointment. Bottom line - I have a luxury car worth over $80,000 with all the bells and whistles that drives like a 1972 Fiat. Despite being in business three times in the first 90 days, the vehicle continues to rattle and vibrate violently, the ""premium sound system"" sounds like a transistor radio, and the ""air-conditioned seats"" are nothing more than a dim fan with imperceptible effect. Two thumbs down!",0
107,"The most annoying problem with the car is that there is a significant and very distracting vibration in the steering wheel, driver's seat and center console when the car is idle. That alone makes me uncomfortable with this car. The car has been serviced 3 times. American Honda Corp. ""s position on this issue is that it is within manufacturing standards. There is also significant vibration in the steering wheel and roughness at highway speeds. The road noise is loud. This car does NOT get 34 mpg, at best 30. I would not buy this car again. I would recommend testing several cars and reading many customer reviews.",0
108,"My wife hated the way he drove through town, so now it's mine. The gearbox is definitely a design flaw and there should be a recall. On the highway it feels like a dream. It's like being on a track and it requires discipline to stay below 100 km / h. I had a lift noise and after several service visits they had to replace the cylinder head. It was another nightmare. Dealer and BMW should have done better to compensate for my inconvenience.",0
109,"If you pull forward every time (sounds like a gearbox) and we were told several times that this was normal. Now it's looked at. Brakes squealed and the whole neighborhood laughed at the new truck when it reversed. Now it squeaks when steering in both directions and the car has only 7,200 miles under its belt. Hate it already. You don't know what's going to happen next.",0
110,"I have my rabbit for 2 years and love to drive it. The problem with this car is that if something happens to it (or even if you need an oil change), you get stuck in the poor house. Be careful, the rabbit is very maintenance intensive and once out of the plot expensive. I was slightly behind, little dent: 900 dollars. I drove a dirt road leading to a mountain trail and bumped into a bump, the gearbox needs to be replaced: 7000 dollars. Even an oil change: 90 dollars. I save the 7000 dollars needed to fit a new gearbox, and choose a reliable, low-maintenance Japanese car as I had it before.",0
111,"The styling of the car is impressive as it has the lines of a much more expensive car, the ride was disappointing, very bumpy and not driver-friendly at highway speeds. I was willing to overlook the firm ride when the stability on the highway was solid, but that's just not the case. The gearbox tends to shift up at low revs (1K-2K), which leaves a tired feeling under normal acceleration, although the 6 cyl is very responsive when you step on it or use the paddle shift instead.",0
112,"After waiting for this car and paying for the upgrades, I feel like my money has gone down the drain. Day 1, picking up the car, leaving the dealership, and there's a cracking sound from the suspension, the CD player was broken. As I took the car in, I realized that the suspension had to be repaired, the front tires had to be replaced, and the CD player among other things. A month after taking possession, the car starts making all kinds of rattles and loud noises when it comes to a stop. The cat has been replaced, and lots of clips and mould in the car. The gearbox started popping out of third gear, which is still being worked on. Overall, Honda has already done over 9K warranty work on the car!",0
113,"My main criticism of this car is that it doesn't have a lockable glove compartment. For heaven's sake, Kia's got lockable glove compartments. How can you hand your vehicle over to a valet? Probably a Mercedes would drive to valet parking more often than most? On top of that, access to the rear seats is done by lifting and pulling the rear seat. Cars that are sold at half the price have electric motors that do that. It's like driving an old Euro taxi. Quality of construction, first year, 3. Brake disc cover fell out when the boot was closed, wailing belt disc, seat belt not foldable properly.",0
114,"I got a lemon. My Escape was great for the first 6 months and now it seems to be in the store every week. Rear hatch mechanism failed twice, had to replace capacitor motor due to a gearbox leak. My temperature and door lock options on the convenience package change on their own and Ford has no solution yet. Fog lights fill up with water and go out.",0
115,"When I bought this car, I loved the equipment. Today, almost two years later, I regret the purchase. Although I am still very pretty, everything breaks in a minivan: the rear cup holders, the rear sonar, the rear cover. Every little piece of plastic that can break breaks. I could understand when I was hard on the vehicle.",0
116,"I bought the Tiburon new. I immediately had problems with the tires. I had to ventilate them within the first month, and then every 6-8 weeks. It was returned to the dealer four times. They said no obvious leak, maybe a gasket problem. So they added nitrogen. 8 weeks later the tire was low again. Deal will not replace the tire. Hyundai customer service says Hyundai is not responsible for defective tires, the tire manufacturer is. I bought road hazards and extended warranty. No one covers defective tires. I do not feel safe driving.",0
117,"2 radiators, turbo steering, P / S pulley, A / C repair, still Smimmys when starting from the stop. Trans shifts hard from time to time, as if I had landed at the back. Dealer says no problem found. Comes three to five times a day in rain, sucks fuel in the rain. Dealer says this is normal. Before the computer is updated, maybe three times a week. The truck has electricity, I'm afraid to go out of circulation. Will the radiator leak? Will I start a desert fire from the rain? Do I have to run 60 miles because the truck breaks down? My 2000 Ford f250 4X4 7.3L, (newly purchased), 268,000 miles in the store 4 times.",0
118,"The rest is mostly negative, the driving position is very uncomfortable for me. I'm an average size 5 '6 ""woman and I think the seats are too small. If it was a purchase from another car dealership, I would have returned it the first week, but I've been stuck with it for years. He's been in the store 5 times. The clutch makes a noise when it's pressed and again when it's released, the side windows rattle in its gaskets, after 2,500 miles the service engine started up and the cruise control stopped working. I definitely should have tested this car longer and explored other options!",0
119,"I like the petrol performance, the ride and the handling, but at 1100 miles I noticed that when I filled the tank, the gas supply was only three quarters full! Now at 2100 miles I have a indicator light on the engine and the code says that the level sensor in the tank no longer works! It is a disappointment to have problems with such low mileage, and I wonder if this is the beginning of things to come!",0
120,"An annoying rattle turned into a much bigger problem: I pressed the clutch, then the gear lever jumped out of the gear into idle, without even touching it. Then, while driving and in gear, the gear lever just jumped out and into idle. No clutch needed. Now, on the second gearbox. Very noisy around the gearbox; difficult to shift - especially into third gear. Last night it started: pressed clutch and once on the accelerator pedal and let go: Next thing I know, the engine revs totally, as if I'm still accelerating! BLACK! I just want a replacement - here we go!",0
121,"Have a 1998 GS 400. I have owned / rented at least 5 other cars since 1993. It does not live up to the hype. Extremely annoying feeling, gas-electric-gas-getting in / out etc. at speeds around 59 km / h. Tiny trunk. I am trying to get out under this ""Edsel."" PS: The mileage is really only a few hundred meters better than my GS 400.",0
122,"I only had to replace $270 out of pocket brake pads. I have owned many new cars in my life and never replaced brake pads under 10k miles. That was a disappointing experience, so I wrote a letter to American Honda. There are other similar complaints on the Internet. Honda needs to make improvements to the materials of the brake pads. Otherwise, the car is comfortable, fun to drive and economical.",0
123,"Apart from numerous dealer visits within the 25 km that I have covered with this car, this is not a bad car: the engine is very quiet, quiet, but not as powerful as I would wish, even with manual gearbox. The minus points for this car are various chassis noises & terrible manual / factory flywheel combination. At about 5000 miles, the manual gearbox had to be replaced. Immediately after, various TSBs for interior noise & passenger side A-pillar head airbag cover were replaced. Now, I hear a clatter in the suspension area when I ride over any kind of bumps or road inadequacies. In addition, plastic clips that cause noise come loose in the interior.",0
124,"I did a lot of research to see what new car I wanted to buy. I chose the Impala. Had a 72 and loved it. After taking my time and looking around, I finally bought the 08 Impala. But I was afraid to touch the brakes. I had replaced them and the day after they were just as bad, if not worse, than before I had them edited. Pulsed as I stopped and jolted me back and forth until I stopped. The front axle gasket had to be repaired, it was leaking. I had an emissions sensor go out and had it repaired. OnStar is not working properly, the dealer checks the recalls to see what needs to be repaired. Seats are very uncomfortable. Very disappointed. I researched and got stuck. Oh, the glove box broke.",0
125,"The rattles and leaky windshields make you feel like you're watching an outdoor concert with bad music. If you hit a pothole, OnStar wants to know if everyone in the car is OK - even though they think I'm about 80 miles from where I actually was... and they called three times to check if there was anything wrong. I listened to them more than the radio. Where can I find the fuse to kill the animal?",0
126,"I researched this vehicle before buying it and found that all but one were good reviews, one stating that he had electrical problems right from the start. Well, I'm the second. After only 10 months, the alarm went off when I unlocked and opened the door. They replaced a shift chart. Then, the steering wheel didn't tilt anymore. They changed the switch twice and then the steering column. Then, it didn't tilt anymore and didn't tilt anymore, so they replaced a shift chart. Three weeks later, it does it again. DVD volume is much louder than the radio and they can't fix it. The fan under the hood is sometimes very loud. I get a lot of rattling and wind noise now.",0
127,"Our problems began after 4 months and less than 3000 miles when a p.S. hose burst on January 21st, 2008. The dealer said that probably water in the p.S. hose was frozen and the line burst! In N.A. there were no hoses available, so the dealer finally pulled out a new vehicle to get us going after a week. A second p.S. hose burst on February 13th, causing smoke and exhaust fumes to enter our vehicle while driving! The P.S. hose was replaced again.",0
128,"I have owned this car for 1 / 1 and had nothing but problems with the front suspension. This car has very weak front springs, especially the right side down with every bump in the road, inclined driveways forget it. The front underside has had to take a beating with such a weak suspension. Was (so far) several times in the store. The dealer has replaced the front strut, aligned and repositioned a strut, also to get rid of a loud bang on the left front. Comes back to the store next week. Springs are so weak that I can compress them with one hand Fuel consumption I find above average, great dashboard and indicators, comfortable seats (do not spill them).",0
129,"The first car I've ever bought. Family has always owned a Dodge without problems. I've owned the vehicle for 7 months and have been in business 7 times (mainly due to unreliable technicians). I have a squeak in the dashboard and in the passenger door that just won't go away. Recently, the bed of the pickup was moved out of the passenger compartment. Even after 2 hours driving time, the MDS doesn't know what to do (the vehicle keeps swelling with fluctuating revs).",0
130,"Start with my X5 has only 3500 miles in it, at 2000 miles came the engine light, by mechanics something is wrong with the catalytic converter, recently a fan while driving on the highway crashed onto my front panel and caused a quarter-sized hole, the side trim behind the headlight is made of composite or some kind of plastic.",0
131,Ahhhh - now I can say what I can. It gets bad gasoline mileage and I have only 6706 miles on it and had it already in the service department 3 times with window switch and engine light going on. There is no electricity.,0
132,"This is the worst car I have ever owned. Passenger windows rattle, brakes are bad, the seat is hard and uncomfortable, the radio sound is dreary, the paint feels rough, as if it has dirt embedded, the steering wheel does not return to the central position without help. I read all the reviews before buying and can't believe they were overwhelmingly positive. Maybe the higher models are more comfortable.",0
133,"I have 8 Passats from 2007 that I use as TaxiCabs. 3 engines and 4 transmissions are already gone. Granted, we put a lot of miles on it, but the turbo engine just can't stand it. Computers require multiple visits to the dealer for the reflash and these cars absolutely burden the company's wallet. I've always owned Audis and VW's and never had so many problems. Absolute windfall.",0
134,"I was disappointed with the ride. It certainly wasn't comparable to my former Mercury Mountaineer, but the handling is very agile. I wish I'd noticed how bland the car was compared to other SUVs.",0
135,"The 650 has what BMW calls an ""inherent characteristic"": when you drive in ""manual"" gear-shifting mode, the vehicle tends to stutter when you stop. Imagine bobbing your head back and forth like a dashboard doll. The vehicle is also prone to severe failures when driving at m1 (such as in a multi-storey car park looking for a place or moving forward on a measured motorway ramp) and to a lesser extent when it comes to the automatic. The failures are dangerous and you have to drive defensively at 4 miles per hour. BMW says the problem is related to the software - it thinks the engine is stalling and the computer is throttling the engine. BMW will not fix the problem.",0
136,"I now think I made a mistake in buying this vehicle. I thought it would be a great investment. No, the petrol performance is bad and there's this extremely annoying wind noise on the driver's side. From other comments it seems that it can't be repaired. Yes, the vehicle doesn't look good, but we bought it because of the equipment and the price. We're very disappointed and are looking at our options to get something else. It doesn't work very well on the road. It has a tendency to float and I can almost see the gas meter moving. As another guy said, I guess you get what you pay for.",0
137,"I've had this car for three months, 2100 miles so far. My concerns are this: the engine spins when I hit the brakes (but not always), the brakes seem weak and just don't feel right, the paint job seems to be cheap. I notice orange peel surface and there are spots, especially near the windshield where the clear paint is worn out or never existed. I don't seem to get the gasoline performance I should be. I drive about 85% downtown and usually get about 30 km / h. I don't think I'll keep this car for long and I'm worried about how it will look and run after 2 years.",0
138,"I bought this terrible minivan and have been dissatisfied ever since.,.Front-end vibrates whole car.. dealer had car for 1 / 2 of the month and factory representative said, ""he knows the vibrations I experience..."" And... I now submit to BBB as a Hyundai warranty application, but for the extra $$$$$I would have spent, it would have been worth saving myself this aggregate... I took another entourage from the lot & test drive.. The vibration existed in the new toooo.. Especially at 75-80 the steering wheel wobbled uncontrollably... Must be a technical defect or my car was built on a day before or after a vacation.",0
139,"If you are interested in an 08 Acadia, do yourself a favor and run! All the problems with the first year of 07's just continued with the 08's. I went back to the dealer every month in the first year of ownership with one problem after another. The biggest problems are the fuel consumption of 10mpg and several water leaks that could not be fixed. Please note that if you decide to buy and have problems, the only thing you get from GM customer service is a free oil change. Please learn from my mistake!",0
140,"Due to the poor design of the Freedom Hardtop and the inability of the passenger seat to fold forward far enough to allow even small dogs easy access, it is, in my opinion, almost impossible to get any passengers out of the vehicle in the event of a crash.",0
141,"My Jeep Patriot came to me from the factory with a broken crank and a faulty sensor, so I can hold my breath every morning while listening for 10-15 seconds before finally turning around. I think to myself, this is the day it doesn't start, every morning! I'm going to see a certified Chrysler dealer for the third time to fix this problem! wish me luck! On top of that, there's something wrong with the fuel gauge and I ran out of gasoline on the highway because I was standing about 5 miles after the tank light went on. One headache after another with this Jeep Patriot and I had such high hopes. Buyers beware!",0
142,"No legroom for the rear seats. No automatic on / off headlights. Hard driving. Opening the driver's door after a ride does not open the back door. You must use either the remote control or the door knob to open the back doors. Poor fuel economy. Wish there were at least one beep when you arrive at walls or curbs (this is expected for cars over 30,000). Tom",0
143,"The Tacoma was more spacious. It has some spongy brakes to get used to (TRD 4x4). The interior is A +! Good performance and ride. Very comfortable sitting. I've owned Chevys all my life. This is the first Toyota I've bought. Sold was my 04 Colorado Z71 crew cab, which blows it away by hand. Although I bought the fully loaded Colorado, it just feels cheap to drive compared to the Tacoma. Great job Toyota! Some extra lighting for the 4x4 and various other switches would help. I also had to order an interior filter. Toyota makes the slot for one, but doesn't place one there? C'mon.",0
144,"If you have not had any problems, just wait. I not only had numerous problems, but the dealer is just as bad. Steering noise AC went from brakes squealing now steering rod WHAT NEXT!!! 07 Car of the Year???????",0
145,"I bought a 2008 Rondo today, I think I made a mistake, the test drive took place in city traffic, where I did not see some of the defects, on the long drive home there was a very annoying noise in the driver's window (incoming air), the car is very ""floating"" and seems too smug on the road, I do not feel to be in command of my car, the four cylinder engine howls so loudly as if it could explode before we really get going, I think about bringing it back in the morning and getting my money back, a cheap car in which I do not feel safe.",0
146,"After 6 weeks in possession of the car and 3,000 miles, I noticed color chips on the side in front of the rear tires. I took it to the dealer and they took photos and sent them to Mitsubishi and they said they wouldn't cover it up, that it was my fault. The front tires release stones that cause sandblasting on the side of the car, they said they didn't make mud flaps for them yet. It's getting worse every day. I see more people have the same problem. I'm now filling out paperwork for the attorney general.",0
147,"I've had my Explorer for about a year now and I still hate it. First, I'm a mountain biker. As I tried to tow a trailer full of weight, our CrossCountry mountain bikes got stuck on the Explored. Plus, there must be some pretty sizeable mud flaps on this car. Very disappointing V8. Nobody knows where the inner door handles are and the exterior look is about as plain as possible. This car is incredibly clumsy and shuffles in real 4-wheel situations that I don't trust.",0
148,"It wasn't worth it - I'd rather spend more money on gasoline to have a car with a bit of torque. Resale value looks great - will move toward something sportier in the range of 200 + horsepower / torque. Not a bad car, but it's the first / last Honda I'll ever own.",0
149,"I am an avid Ford owner, but I am extremely disappointed to learn that at 54,000 miles I am told that they know there is a problem with the transmission (CVT) and that they recognise the risk it poses to the public, but they are not prepared to repair at their expense. I really do not want another car, but I cannot justify repairing that car.",0
150,"We exchanged a 1998 Toyota Corolla to buy our 2007 Nissan Versa in order to save gasoline, and the sticker on the window indicated that we would get 28 city miles and 35 highway miles. We've owned this car for almost a year now and come just 23 miles to the gallon, far from our old Tokota, which was running perfectly. So now, we not only have a car allowance, but a car that gets terrible gasoline miles. We've tried to unload this car several times to buy a car that gets good gasoline miles, only to find that a car that we paid less than a year ago for $14,000 is only worth about $9 or 10,000. I'm so sad that we don't own our Tokota anymore. Nice car, fun to drive, but don't buy it to save money.",0
151,"6-speed gearbox is annoying. Constantly in town and in the countryside. Dashboard and door panels in the interior are cheap. Same material I have in my GM work car! Interior is hard to clean. Outside is time-consuming to dry after washing. Lots of nooks and crannies. Nice to look at, a pain to own.",0
152,"I didn't expect to get 19 MPG on hwy after reading on the Jeep website that you get 380 miles of range per full tank. 210 miles into the trip on flat South Florida hwy, I had to stop for gasoline and every 210 to 230 miles thereafter for the rest of the trip and on the way back. Yes, air conditioning was on, but 19 mpg. I love the car, the interior and exterior design, but I'm very disappointed with the gasoline performance. Mileage was an important factor in the purchase decision and I feel I was lied to.",0
153,"EPA 23 to 27? Was that measured while it was going straight downhill? Combined highway and road driving is 19 mpg and that was with the cruise control on the highway. If you turn back after refueling and then drive 10 miles in the city, 15 mpg is displayed, about as much as my 4200 pound VW Vanagon and not even close to a 2001 C280 Mercedes 6 or a BMW 325 6 cyl, both German cars get from 25 to 34 mpg on the highway. That reminds me it was 27 mpg on the highway, but that ended when the first hill approached, then the engine was switched on and spun to 5,000 rpm and the MPG gauge crashed to the low teens. Sorry Honda, but that's not a gasoline eagle, it eats!",0
154,"Shortly after I got this car, something started rattling in the door panel. I had to go to 3 different dealerships to finally get one that was ready to take off the door panel to fix it. Squeak / rattle all over the car when it is driving on rough ground. Roof, when it is stored in the trunk, squeaks like crazy. Windows squeal when it is rolled all the way up where it hits the roof. Dealers would apply some lubricant that works for about a week, then it rattles / squeaks again and gets worse. In real people with 400 horsepower, the acceleration is not much faster than with a 270 horsepower V6 Toyota Camry. Probably not worth enduring the noisy tire and all the bad interior.",0
155,"The vehicle contained most of the options, but the smaller 8-cyl sticker cost $41k. Saw the 2008 at the dealership when it was first put into service in April, 08 liked it because of improved features on most of the options. Thought I would swap and knew I would be hammered on the trade. I didn't expect to be slaughtered. The dealer called me a trade value of $23,500 or 12,500 less than the purchase price three months earlier and was only willing to lower the sticker price on 08 by $4,000. If people realize that these pigs not only devour gas, but consume your equity, we won't see many more.",0
156,"My first reason for buying the Outlook was the advertised fuel economy. I thought it was too good to be true, and I was right. I have exactly 2596 miles in the vehicle. I use the cruise control carefully on the highway, traveling alone in the vehicle at a speed of 65 km / h and can never get better than 20 km / h. I also had the time to test the views I drive in the city until I only ever had to refuel with myself in the vehicle and the best mileage I got was 13 km / h. I am so unhappy. Next time I will rent a car before I buy.",0
157,"I have a knock / rattle when I accelerate when the car is cold. I had my car in and out of Nissan service about 10 times at that time. I eventually got them to admit that the noise exists.

158,"I buy this car and it was ok at first glance, but after driving a few miles on it, it started to collapse on me. Hyundai took care of towing and work the first two times, but refused the third time. I would not recommend the car.",0
159,"I gave up on Chevy in 2001, having left Nissan (Maxima & Altima) behind me until 2008, when I was lured back to Chevy with strong incentives. ""The Car You Can't Ignore"" ads were on every 5 minutes. At first, the car was fun, but I swear it reacts less the more I drive it. Acceleration is sluggish, and the steering is stiffer than new. I just found out that the steering box fails at just 16km. The back seat doesn't lock properly, and if you stare too hard at the sheet metal, you can dent it with sheer willpower.

If it rains or there is an ice storm, the elements pile up inside the door post, increasing the possibility that the vehicle will rust. It's a spacious vehicle, but I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this model. ABS is terrible. Don't even think about braking! It was my first experience with such a system, and I had to go to the dealer about three times before I realized that I had to deal with it until I sold this vehicle.",0
161,"I bought a new truck, after about 200 miles I felt a vibration throughout the truck.

Very dissatisfied and sick.",0
162,"I bought this 08 g6 in September 2007. At about 9,000 miles, the steering broke and had to be replaced. Shortly after, the brake discs warped.

I realize that this car is smaller and not designed to compete with the A6 (even the older Audi A6 from 2002), but what she and I notice every time we drive along the highway is the wind noise coming from the windshield. In the snow (we have 4Matic), it doesn't work like the Quatro A6 that she had learned to love... not even close... the back space is limited to children (in no case 4 adults will feel comfortable driving that car), and lacks the dashboard (she also has the hinged sat nav version) in style... it looks ""American"" and is surpassed by the new Cadillac CTS that it competes with... this is a first!",0
164,"I have owned this Jeep for 3 months and last month I only had problems with it. The fan belt failed 4 times, the dealer had to replace the engine at 1664 miles, put on a new alternator at 1700 miles and this time he was in the shop for a week waiting for a new power steering pump. Every time I drive it deeper than 6 / 8 inches in the snow, the fan belt detaches, spraying the power steering fluid throughout the engine compartment. Now, when I use the heater, I have to open a window to get rid of the smell of the burnt power steering so I don't get sick. I haven't even taken it 4 wheels yet. These are definitely not the Jeeps they once were. Don't buy one.",0
165,"When I bought the car, part of the bumper was scratched and the dealer fixed it. Then, within weeks of buying the car, my struts made a creaking noise, the dealer replaced the struts. I complained a few times about the air that smelled terrible when the air conditioner was on, and they couldn't fix it (they couldn't smell it). The car started ticking within the last week and took it to a dealer near my work. With 31 km on the car, the dealer tells me that I burned out the clutch and I have to pay $500 for a new clutch!

168,"After reading all these other problems, I wouldn't recommend this truck - with the price you pay, Chevy has to learn to build a truck that doesn't fall apart. Seriously disappointed. The dealer has done all the work on it, and even they tell me that Chevy knows that brakes are their biggest problem. Save your money - buy something different every month that isn't in business! With so much domestic trash, it's no wonder that GM has a hard time.",0

It was in the store to replace the door sensor, the air conditioning was turned off so they replaced the internal thermostat, the sensor that would show us the outside temperature was replaced, the passenger seat was unreliable and the armrest fell off and was replaced, 2 tires were replaced and the icing on the cake that we needed to replace the brakes at 22,000 miles. The dealer told me that they would replace a lot of the brakes on that car. What's really disgusting is that they want you to pay for replacing the broken brakes that they installed.

173,"I wanted Toyota quality, what I got was Toyota cheap! This car has too much plastic (for example, it's under the side of the door and the quarter panels), too much emphasis on youthful chic and not enough Toyota-typical quality. No wonder they invented a new brand. The radio pops when you turn it on after a short time, due to a lack of integration of the factory amplifier option. This happens with every Scion with the factory-installed amplifier. When I first got it, the radio popped every time I changed the transmitter! It also has cheap tin that pops at the slightest pressure. I thought I would dent the hood, hatchback and doors a few times when I first woke it up. The whole roof is glass. On the plus side, it's fun to drive.",0

Now, it goes through 6 liters of oil in just 1,500 miles & I had numerous other problems, all related to warranty. It's because of the oil problem known to GM, but as the dealer was advised not to try a repair, for no less than a week in business. Fortunately, I have a good dealer who tries to solve the problem, but has to tear the engine apart for it. And all in 19 minutes of use. For the price, it's not worth the frustration and the days without it! Too bad b / c apart from the warranty and oil issues I'd like!",0

Now, the sliding doors don't close properly (seems to be a common complaint), but the service department of our local dealer can't find anything wrong. The biggest problem is the water dripping from the sunroof, dripping from the control panel (dome lights / door handles, etc.) Also, the water leaking out of the dashboard in the rain and collecting water on the floor of the passenger side. There are tons of cables down there, so I can't imagine what fun I have to look forward to.

Key chains died - even after repeated attempts. A lot of small annoying problems that were expensive and uncomfortable to fix.",0

No, not (I was told it works, but no, it doesn't work), you don't lock the doors automatically after you've reached the 12 or 15 miles per hour, as most cars do. After reading the manual, I find that if you lock the four-wheel drive, it switches off at 19 miles per hour. I couldn't believe it, so I call Hyundai and they told me, yes, it works.",0
181,"This is by far the worst car I have ever owned. You might think BMW notifies its customers when they have a problem with the car, the fuel injectors and pump work all the time and every time I take it they tell me there is no problem. This is my first BMW and my last.",0
182,"The stabilizer lamp comes on and the dealers don't find a problem. The vehicle wouldn't move once the light comes on. We eventually used Onstar to detect the fault code, but the dealers we took it to couldn't identify the problem. Windows are slowly going up and are noisy.",0
183,"I have owned a Camry from 1993 and a Camry from 2001, and this 2008 Camry is terrible compared to those two. I am so disappointed with the cheap plastic parts, the terrible squeak and rattle and the terrible gearbox. This car is by far the best looking Camry I have ever had, but the worst quality of the three. It has been in business FOUR times already. My other Camrys have never been in business for anything other than oil changes!!",0
184,"This SUV works like a truck and drives like a truck on a normal road. I recently put it on the road, I wish I could bring it back, it was the worst driving than 18 wheels. (1) In 2 months the A / C engine had to be replaced. (2) reversing lights at night are so bad that you can't see the kerb (try it out). (3) You have to constantly accelerate to drive forward, or it slows down drastically. (4) Now the engine sitting on the drive side makes noise. (5) So, it's just a bad SUV.",0
185,"This car needs new tyres because of a factory defect, it has always bounced off the road, now we know why. It now needs a rear upper control arm replacement. The company evaluates the tyres according to a kind of formula based on tyre depth and mileage. We were told by our dealer that no pro rata money is allowed on the basis of the formula. The car is dangerous. I feel let down by Honda.",0
186,"We have the same knock noise that others have mentioned, for which it went up in smoke (a / c burnt out) and stranded us on the highway w / my 4 mo old. We have rattles / creaks etc. Poor gas mileage. The a / c knocks again and we complain about lemon law. It was only yesterday, after we had picked it up from the dealer, that the airbag light came on. We were told they couldn't get it until Friday (it's married), but to drive it b / c, we won't have airbags in case of a crash (no rental possible) and Hyundai warranty doesn't guarantee rental.",0
187,Our SEL Ford Edge AWD has been repaired 4 times and I smell burning oil again. They have replaced seals and entire unit and it is still leaking!!! Ford needs to let Edge owners know how and when they can fix this problem.,0
188,"Owned by 3 Camrys-1991,1995 & 2004; due to satisfactory previous owner's history - I made BIG mistakes with this purchase! Calls made online all day and nightly test drives on Saturday evenings. A week later I realized DISCLAIMED CONSTRUCTION & INFERIOR QUALITY of the plastic material of the interior, fabric, exposed metal & screws on the floor, reduced and eliminated compartments, eye / sunglasses holder, small poorly constructed seat driver, passenger seat & rear without elbows cramped interior, smaller boot etc. Only 5 '4 roof of the car close to the head. Cheap fabric on seat not sewn-just stuffed into cheap plastic buckets of the seat. Driver seat should be ergonomically correct - miserable drive.",0
189,"The fuel consumption of this truck leaves a lot to be desired. My truck is GPS'd, so I can only drive the speed limit without getting into trouble. The best I've ever gotten for fuel economy is 14.8 mpg. The quality of the truck is less than desirable. In cold weather (less than -20c), the rear doors don't lock completely without hitting them hard. I actually knocked the bar from the door and tried to lock it. When the doors are closed, they squeak and clatter so badly that you have to turn up the radio. I had to install a second battery to get the truck to start up after more than 3 days.",0
190,"After much research we bought our 2008 Sport Highlander only three weeks ago. After two weeks of driving we heard a noise when we were accelerating the car (mind you it only has 750 miles under its belt). In short, we took a look at it and realized that we needed a new gearbox!!!! We are not happy and now doubt the reliability of our car.",0
191,"The car is powerful, fast, has a great gearbox and is normally fun to drive. However, I have had a terrible problem with squeaking and rattling in the dashboard and other interior noises that have taken the fun out of driving. Besides, I am not a big person, but headroom in the interior is very limited, even when the seat is fully lowered. It is very easy to bang your head when you get into the car. My dealer could not fix the noise problem and rebuilt the dashboard so that it did not fit around the central instrument cluster properly. I was tired of hearing the noises every time there was a bump on the road and after only five months and 6,000 miles I replaced it.",0
192,"I had the car for 15 months, and during that time the fuel pressure regulator was replaced. At 14 months, the car developed coarse idling and strong vibration that could not be repaired, and I was told that this was ""normal"" for this car. I had never had a rougher idling car in all the small cars I owned.",0
193,"To our disappointment, we found that the wheels & hubs accumulate with snow, ice or mud, creating an unpleasant vibration that can only be alleviated by thoroughly washing the wheels with a high-pressure cleaner. The dealer informs us that this is a common problem with all newer vehicles due to the open hub. I suspect that this is a run. I also drive a 2008 Explorer at work that has no such problem.",0
194,"I bought my 2007 Entourage in the spring of 2007. Automatic sliding doors have not worked properly since I bought them. Every time I bring them for maintenance, I am told that there is nothing wrong with the doors. The only problem is the average gas mileage of about 17 MPG - not what I expected. I want to get rid of them so badly - but the value has fallen so much - I can't get rid of them anymore!!!",0
195,"I leased a 2008 GTS in December 2007, only to get rid of it shortly afterwards. My right front door rattled terribly and the dealer always pretended not to hear it. He also refused to print work orders for my car. I ran out of windshield wipers in the pouring rain on the highway for about 5 minutes during rush hour. The subwoofer in the trunk was dismantled within the first week of my car.",0
196,"I bought the Gl 450 4.7 Ltr about a year ago. It spent over 2.5-3 months in the dealership while I was trying to fix electronic problems. As I was driving it went up and then the warning lights went on like Christmas. The lights warned of the following failures: ABS, airbags, to name just a few that were all on. Then a big red box on the LED would go straight to the dealership without switching on how to do it in an automatic, I am still trying to figure out. We live in an isolated state with few roads and great distances between help. My belief in the Gl is gone! Hopefully no one has ever experienced this. It still looks nice parked in my garage.",0
197,"Even after a few days, there were still problems with this SUV. Nothing really big except removable stuff, seat belts that don't work (twice). This SUV is characterized by poor workmanship and an overall blunt driveline.The cargo space is quite large and the third row sat for children to work. Burnt on the price tag, you should get a better driving quality and definitely a better workmanship quality.The Bluetooth function is very poor and doesn't sync with most phones. Even the dvd system has some problems. Poor fuel economy. Acura compares to BMW, but they still have a long, long way to go.",0
198,"It feels like a two-door Cadillac with a four-cylinder engine. That is, it doesn't feel fast, the suspension is terrible, it never feels comfortable, and I just don't find a good seating position. The cabin feels claustrophobic and cramped and I'm not a tall person (5 '5 ""). If I could give it back, I would. I don't think I'll keep this car for much longer and accept my losses. I'll give a maximum of 6 months. Completely disappointed. Depressed and dissatisfied. I probably won't be able to buy a Honda again.",0
199,"I thought this was my dream car. Traded in a 2001 Nissan Altima. (Miss it) I bought this car on Monday and it's been in business since Wednesday. Car broke on my way to work, when I got it back on, the engine light came on, took it to a dealer and they couldn't repeat the problem. Again collapsed the next day, on my way to work, car still in business. They claim that it won't be repaired until Monday or Tuesday, needs to install a whole new assembly? Refuse to give me money back, no offer of another car to make amends for bad Civic. First new car in 20 years and thought Honda was the best. The exterior is fantastic, love the dashboard. Can't say anything to mpg, didn't drive it or had it long enough to know it",0
200,"We found that the electronics, including radio and Bluetooth, are inferior to the TL. Disappointing. Also, some of the features such as driver's key tags (1 or 2) are not available on the ES 350, as on the TL. Very disappointing that satellite radio was not included, as was the dealer's cars with the option. Had to have the dealer add satellite radio at an exorbitant price. The Acura TL has this standard. A car in this price range should have an excellent radio; excellent Bluetooth; and satellite radio. Could be the first and last Lexus.",0
201,"The van is beautiful inside and out, with many extras. Unfortunately, we also have a van that brakes every time we take our foot off the gas. We returned it 2 days after the purchase and 7 weeks later we are still on the road. This is my first new vehicle and I am terribly disappointed about it. The service manager and the district manager keep us waiting so he can test the van. This problem is already evident in the feel of the vehicle and can also be seen on the speedometer... the gearbox does not trigger. Bad service!",0
202,"The exterior paint is ""cheap & delicate"" (scratches extremely lightly to the metal, I had to pay for bird droppings), the interior ""plastic"" (dashboard, doors) scratches extremely lightly, and the upholstery hooks like crazy. The small windows at the front create blind spots. The window sticker on purchase said: Highway 30, and I've never gotten over 25-26 mpg. Small tank. Cruise control is not standard, nor armrests. Not very comfortable. Difficult to handle in strong winds. Rear seat little legroom. Not ""family car.""",0
203,"I hope Toyota recalls this engine. I feel deceived by Edmunds.com because I rave about this truck that almost guarantees reliability because it is a Toyota. Guess: Toyota reliability is outdated, now I know it. I must mention that this truck left me stranded on the highway. I had to wait 4 hours for a tow truck.",0
204,"My Kia Rio5 has been in business 5 times this month due to the same problem! Kia will only approve minimal repairs and has yet to repair my vehicle. I was without my car last month and after replacing the engine and oxygen sensor, the vehicle is still broken. What does Kia say??? Nothing. They will not return my calls. What is the use of a 10 year / 100,000 mile warranty if Kia does not cash it in! Kia do not buy! The cars are cute and economical but not reliable and Kia is not behind their product!",0
205,"I live in Colorado, where we had over 90 degree heat for 20 days, and when I go home by car, the air conditioner always turns on when the car stops (with or without stopping). Honda manufacturing and my local dealer have confirmed, ""That's the way the car goes."" To get the air conditioner to blow cold air, the engine has to be above a certain speed. ""Do you have any idea how uncomfortable it is to sit in the blazing sun at 5,200 feet without air conditioning? It sucks. That's why I bought a car with air conditioning.",0
206,"I have owned this car for 7 months now. By the time the weather got really hot, the car seemed to be virtually problem-free. Squeaking and rattling seem to come alive throughout the interior and determining the area is difficult. Both sun visors broke in the heat and could not be maintained. A / C condensation flows into the interior instead of out. Inside, it is very easy to scratch / scratch / scratch. Inside, the fabric and door panels begin to fade in the summer sun. As for the driving, the clutch squeaks, the gear shift crashes against a wall (all gears) and A / C belt squeaks repeatedly. Pedestrians get lost in the big blind spots and the throttle reaction lags behind.",0
207,"My wife and I bought two SX-4s in December 2006. At first we liked the car, but after a few months we thought it consumed more gasoline than the salesman told us, but we dealt with it by slowing down our speed to stay below 9 liters / 100 km. We have it now for a little over two and a half years and last week at 72 km, jammed my wife's alternator and it was no longer covered by the warranty, so we paid to replace the alternator. 10 days later, at 78 km, my car's alternator also jammed! We thought this was abnormal, so we called the dealer and he told us he couldn't do anything. We then contacted Suzuki Canada and they told us the same thing. Don't buy this car!",0
208,"In the time I have had this car, it has broken down more times than in the entire life of my 91 CRX. This car was bought to be a daily driver because the CRX was rebuilt and I tried to keep low miles on it. However, I had to drive the CRX more often because this car breaks quite often. So far, in the less than 12 months I have owned it, the fuel pump has been replaced twice, the starter has been replaced once and still does not turn reliably, the tranny has been rebuilt 1 time, the air conditioner has been replaced 1 time, the CD unit has been replaced 1 time, and I am sure I have forgotten a few. I will never buy a Nissan car again and will soon swap it for a Fit.",0
209,"Our Q7 has been at the dealership for 45 days and they have no estimate of when they will return it. This car was a nightmare, the brakes started squealing at 2000 miles and in the 2.5 years I have owned this car, it has been at the dealer over 20 times (with no scheduled maintenance), the starter has been replaced twice, requiring the entire engine to be pulled out of the vehicle (nice design), Audi has breakdown assistance, which is nice as I had to use this service 6 times to have the vehicle towed to the dealer.",0
210,"It's no fun to drive my TL, because accelerating at 2000 rpm feels very rough like grinding under the floor. After 2000 rpm, the rough feeling under the floor clears up. I've owned a lot of cars and our other two older vehicles (one is a truck and the other a small car) surpass it. Other annoyances: When it rains and you open the trunk, water jumps through the gasket and pours into the trunk - including debris. There's excessive noise when the moon roof is closed and the ceiling partition is open when I'm on the highway. I want to get my 2005 TSX back. This is our fourth Acura and probably our last.",0
211,"I bought my car brand new a year ago - I love it despite the quirks on the windows (no fix yet... supposedly at the end of 2008) and have responsibly driven it over 14,000 miles a year to travel the country. Now, the clutch is ""burnt"" and it's not covered by the warranty. They blame me, which is ridiculous. I'd be wary of buying another car.",0
212,"I've had this car for two weeks and I put $130.00 into it just to drive around town, that's an average of 24 miles a day. It evaporated the gas, took it to Suzuki and they found nothing wrong. Saw another woman in the church and she asked me if my car had drunk a lot of gasoline. I said yes, she said she does too. Same model and year of manufacture 08 XL7. Needs to be built economically. Uses a lot of gasoline.",0
213,I pull a 26 foot trailer and when it comes to a hill you think of a four cylinder. GMC should not sell this as a towing unit.,0
214,"I had problems with the electrical systems (door locks, windshield wipers, navigation system) and now the worst of all brakes. I went to the rear after 33,000 kilometers of metal on metal. The brake calipers do not retract properly - so the brake pads wear out completely prematurely. Normally, a car goes through 3 sets of front pads to 1 set of rear pads. I have only had my car serviced by dealers so far. If they turn the tires, I ask them to check the brakes because the wheels are already off. Well, the last visit to the dealership (22,363 miles) was all good - now 11,000 miles later my right rear rotor is being bombarded from the inside just because of a defective brake caliper. What can I do about it?????",0
215,"A hybrid that can't get more than 18 MPG in town???!! It's a joke! For that reason... GM hybrid technology is flawed. Ford got theirs from Toyota and the Escape gets 30 MPG (my neighbor has one), which is no joke. Maybe it's because it's a mild hybrid and GM never came up with the full hybrid or plug-in as expected.",0
216,"Based on several reviews, I bought Odyssey without much thought. It is a good van for the family. But now I have 900 miles in the car with an awful 10-11 miles / gallon city + fwy. I saw some others also complain about low mileage of the Odyssey. While my friends 2008 Odyssey gives 21 mpg city + fwy in my ride. I took it to the dealer and they asked to leave the car for 3 days for fuel testing without any compensation for replacement car. In general, the Odyssey makes a lot of noise.",0
217,"I've owned my vehicle for about a year and a half. I've had it in business 6 times. I've had two recalls and several other problems. I've had the vehicle recalled (having already experienced the barn that could have caused a serious accident), plus I've had a cracked roof railing, panels detached on the passenger side over the seat belt, the air conditioning stopped working at 26,000 miles today, the rear interior light only turns on when you hit it (Dodge says it's a manufacturing problem), loose carpet, loose console cover, seat had to be removed to fix the carpet, and the dirt-repellent seats don't hold up.",0
218,"This car looks great from a distance, but open the trunk and moody, primer everywhere that the paint should be like on the outside! That's probably why the rust protection is what 4 years is! Then stick those kitschy plastic plugs through the carpet on the trunk lid to attach it to the metal and poke holes in the metal to do it - cheaply. I open the hood and there's a long line of open unfinished serrated steel along the inside of each side of the hood. Talk about cheap! Everywhere I look, I see corners cut like this.",0
219,"It makes loud braking noises, especially at low speeds. I also hear the chip noises every time I accelerate the car. I don't think my next car will be a Honda again.",0
220,"I'm now waiting for a new and improved turbo, Jacob's brake, whatever you want to call it, burnt the first turbo. The old turbo had been cleaned and reassembled, the lights reset and regenerated, only to turn on again! I wish I had my 05 5.9 back! I was told to always turbo until the new one came in. I'm pissed off about all the trips to the dealer. I was persuaded to buy the ""free"" 3000-mile oil change. No more! You can push their oil change! Some mechanics scooped my cooling fins flat and, to top it all, I was 2 (two) quarters over the line! I'm investigating the lemon laws in Oregon.",0
221,"The engine, workmanship, fuel economy and driving pleasure were all there, but the sitting position and lack of a dead pedal made me feel very uncomfortable.The throttle is too close to the driver, which meant you constantly took your foot off the accelerator to properly control the throttle.If you reset the seat too far, you won't reach the clutch and steering wheel, and the lack of a dead pedal (or even a flat spot) leaves your foot on a round bump.That was such a pity because the car is really zippy and fun to drive.The new FIT is coming out this fall & I advise to wait and see.",0
222,"The Bluetooth module did not work when I bought it. Fit & Finish item at 5K, now the same problems, but it is no longer under warranty. Interior rattles out of the Wazoo. New engine 24K. Tyre 30K. New transmission 59K. Replaced CV boots 59K. Days in business since I own it, 68. Still vibrations in the drivetrain & ""they can't figure it out."" Only 500 miles to the warranty. Bet they'll find out as soon as I have to pay for it. Best mpg 30, worst mpg 22, average mpg 26. Owned Nissans before, but NEVER!!!",0
223,"My Silverado 1500 Classic already had to rotate the rotors and drums! What happened to the quality of Chevy? It took the dealer's attempt to even figure out what was going on. Just driving in town - it has the tow truck - which I don't use. That mpg is terrible. I've been a Chevy family for a long time, but not anymore.",0
224,"Fell in love with the car's look and would be a happy camper if it weren't for all of the little hiccups the car had. I owned this car for 6 months. In those 6 months the top stopped working, the door locks and the cd player malfunctioned, the inside started rattling and squeaking, and the gas gauge broke. This was a 2007 NBC! If you are thinking about buying this car, please keep looking. Maybe a mini? Believe me when I say HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! If you already own one...good luck!",0
225,"We purchased this vehicle in Jan after searching for many months. Had a 6 cyl Ford Windstar minivan, and wanted SUV style w/o the high cost and poor gas milage. After 3300 miles, like other reviewers began hearing rattling noice in driver front side, as well as hesitation when accelerating. Brought back in at 8500 miles, and was told need new transmission! They have had to replace others. I just got the car back 3 days ago, and it STILL hesitates, however rattling is gone, for now. Loved this car, however not sure if it's going to last me many more years. Don't roll down the 2 back windows, as air pressure/noise is terrible.",0
226,"I purchased the Kia Optima 1 year ago- this is my 3rd Kia. I received a Happy Birthday card from the dealer about a week before the shifter cable disengaged and nearly caused me to crash into a car while trying to park. The dealership examined the cable and said that they had never seen anything like it-nothing was broken or damaged, the cable just came off. Now, almost a month later, I am riding shotgun in my husband's truck as the cable once again has ""disengaged"". I seriously think there is a design flaw in this model and I am just glad I have never tried to used the manual shift feature-- imagine having the cable ""disengaging"" at 75 miles an hour on the interstate!",0

228,"I was so excited to get the newly re-designed 2007 Passat Wagon! What a mistake! I have had this vehicle in the shop THREE times since I purchased it in March 2006. The Engine Malfunction lights keeps coming on and the dealership cannot find the problem, except to say that that there is an evaporator leak that they cannot fix it. The service manager also stated that they had several Passats that were doing this. Please don't think that the dealership will back you up on these problems; THEY WON""T...I wrote a letter to VW and they were unwilling to help me too. Volkswagen will NOT stand behind their vehicle. The brakes squeak, too. Do not buy this vehicle.",0
229,"I have loved Chevrolets and GMCs for 30 years. My 03 Chevy Silverado was the best truck I have ever had. The 08 GMC has been the most disappointing truck I have ever purchased. I am constantly getting alarms that include: Park assist off, air bag, low tires when they are not. On top of the alarms that the dealer cannot fix I have had two interior fans replaced and they are rattling again. The motor is tapping even though I do the recommended everything. The ABS brakes act like I am on ice on dry road. Cheaper braking system. Already have warped discs. My o3 brakes went 144K miles. The sun visors are not wide enough to block the sun. Cannot handle the same trailer as the 03.",0
230,"I currently have one for a company vehicle. Almost 70,000 in 2 years. Vehicle has plenty of power to pull out on busy streets, interior is nicely laid out,(I have auto climate control). No SYNC on earlier model. Decent fuel economy for such a larger vehicle. Styling is nice, even after 70000 miles, its still nice to look at. Fiew issues: CHECK YOUR HOOD! Corrosion on the hoods is a MAJOR issue. I have seen over half with corrosion issues. OEM tires are Terrible! I am currently on my third set, went with GoodYear Integrity tires now. Better ride, better wear. Poor manufacturing standards; Doors don't exactly line up, hood offset, etc. Front brakes wear prematurely.",0
231,"I am very disappointed with this purchase, paint has been chipping and continues to bubble on pieces that had been repainted noise in front sounds like needing new breaks this was all in 3 months of purchasing. Headlights had to be completely replaced, washer fluid leaks on hood, tie down in back fell off and again paint bubbling all with in 6 months of owning vehicle. If own the lt sage, please go over it and check for bubbles of pin head paint. It squeaks like an old truck on very hot days and long rides in stop and go traffic, does not have pickup, the dash color reflects on the windshield which is somewhat distracting. Never will I purchase a Mazda.",0
232,I purchased my first Honda after doing much research on the fuel economy of cars. I bought it new with six miles on it and have had problems with it drifting to the right. I have had it in four times already. First time they did a front end alignment which had failed. It still pulled to the right. Returned that day and they switched tires from rear to front and said it was a radial pull and they put all new tires on it. It continues to drift and now they are telling me it is the road and all Hondas drift to the right. It never pulls left. They also scratched my paint up on the visit with their complimentary wash. Very unhappy!!!,0
233,"I've had my Cobalt a little over a year now, its a fun little car, but ii was expecting more from it. I added new rims/tires and a new exhaust because the appearance was somewhat plain. The inside looks really cheap, Chevy needs a major upgrade on the interior. I have yet to see the mileage Chevy says it gets, a little frustrating. I'd say its a good beginner car, but not really able to compete with other cars in the same category, it just falls short.",0
234,I recently had a problem with car such that the a/c was blowing only hot air. A trip to dealer showed an undiscovered leak in the refrigerant from the system. They were unable to find the leak after 4 hours and have placed a dye in the refrigerant to try to find the 'pin hole' leak. I've never had this problem with a Japanese vehicle. Has anyone else experienced this problem? I now am supposed to drive the car for 3 months and return the vehicle for 'discovery' of the leak.,0
235,"At first we loved this car, then the problems started. I've had it in twice for doors leaking from sunroof drain tubes, going to take it again soon. Seats are ruined from water damage. Have had the strut mounts replaced, windshield wiper blades recalled, can't seem to get the popping noises fixed underneath. We are very upset, also the car won't even make it up our driveway because of the gravels. It stinks for a front wheel drive! wish we never traded. I feel like we have been cheated. This car is a lemon!!",0
236,It is the most uncomfortable car I have driven. I am at a little over 600 miles and only getting 25 mpg on the hwy! I did months of research and THOUGHT i was making a wise buying decision. I won't buy another.,0
237,I find you get alot for your money but I've had my car only a year and 6 months and already had the left front and the right front axle changed along with a door handle that fell of an interior passenger visor. I also had to have my ac panel changed because of peeling and now I'm awaiting a passenger door lock controller and a front right head light. It makes me wonder how much I'm going to have to spend after the 2 YEAR warranty if I will have to bear these frequent visits to the garage without even being in an accident and owning a new car. I would suggest a different car. I'm think of the new Audi cross over Hyundia. By the way I hate the unsteady cup holders an cheap old fashion ac vents.,0
238,I was driving a Maxima for some time and wanted a change. I was convinced to buy American when I really didn't want too. If I knew then what I know now I would never have gotten this Buick LaCrosse. This Buick has been to the dealership 5 times for ONE problem; something with the steering column. I was given an extended warranty by Buick but that did not work. It's still not working right. The car is going back for round six and the SAME ISSUE. I am never going with American cars again. Thanks Buick for making such great American products. HA,0
239,"This car is smoke and mirrors. It's slow, uncomfortable, gets poor gas mileage and is over priced. Paid 45K for a auto and have to tolerate 17 dummy phone switches because the car does not have bluetooth? Honestly, research BMW, Saab, Audi before buying this make. I'd return the car tomorrow if I could. Everyday I walk to this vehicle and wonder why I paid so much for a car with so little? Mercedes Benz must be making about 20 grand profit on each of these ""very, very average"" cars.",0
240,"I have had problems with this vehicle since the day we drove it home from the dealer. After 4 months of trying to deal with Nissan, we have yet to have anyone actually take responsibility to fix or replace this car. We have waited weeks for phone calls. We have a brand new car that we are afraid to drive and nobody seems to know how to fix it. Nissan is also ignoring the service dept at the dealership attempting to repair this car. Guess the next step is to hire a lawyer.",0
241,"Bought as a replacement as I wrecked my 07' saturn vue. 08' Lucerne CX was a dealer demo with approx. 2,400 miles on it. Started to hear a rattle/buzzing noise within the first month coming from the front end area. Brake lights stayed on until I went to the dealer for the repair. Dealer replaced a fuel line problem as there was a GM bulletin on that. To date, I have had the car in 5 times for the rattle and still rattles/buzzes. I'm ""disenchanted"" with this Buick. I'm going to try the rattle repair one more time.....then I'll contact GM personally. (They probably won't care/ or respond) Dealer has been sympathetic to my issue anyway. I'm going to buy Honda next time.",0
242,After first month of owning this Enclave has been nothing but trouble. Since June 08 we have had two transmission software updates (tranny shifting still terrible. Acts as though it doesn't know what gear it's suppose to be in). Rear liftgate opens by itself (when car off luckily). With automatic operation turned off we still hear the lift motor engage. Heat controls stopped working twice. At times when driving all gauges read as though the car is turned off. With cruise control set at 75 MPH for nearly two hours the best MPG I get is 17. In city getting 13 MPG is a good day. Dealer is trying their best but I don't hold out for much improvement.,0
243,"I have owned the X5 for only a year and twice now I encountered a parking brake malfunction. The first time this happened was on Thanksgiving day! Had to get the SUV towed from the gas station, manual hand brake feature would not work. Just today, just went to buy groceries and the parking brake malfunction went on again! Had to wait for tow truck for over 2hrs. No other options but to have SUV towed. Very inconvenient! And have to wait until Monday for dealership to open! Even more inconvenient! Other than this, had to change 2 tires twice due to nail punctures, run flats cannot be patched, spent over $1000! Changed one tire, SUV not even a month old! Not safe for long drives! DO NOT BUY!",0
244,"I am sad to say that I just had an accident in my March 2008 Cobalt. My Cobalt and a Mini Van collided at very low speeds and my car had $7,700 worth of damage. I could not believe how bad the damage was for low speeds of under 25mph. Air bags did not deploy. It was at a residential intersection. I have another 4 years to pay on this having taken out a 5 year loan. I am very upset about it all. I will not buy another Cobalt if they should be available.",0
245,"I am a car hauler. my max weight is 20,000 lb. I have 19,000 (5 months ) miles on the truck with 3 week in the shop for repairs on the cooling system. It has been hard to do business with kind of preformance.",0
246,"I bought this car brand new on 5/23/07. After 2 months, I called the dealership & said I was unhappy with the mpg. I paid extra for CVT transmission to get 33/36 mpg. On any given day (even while using synthetic oil), my best is 30 mpg. He said no one twisted my arm to buy the car. (no Wonder Nissan yanked their contract from this dealership.) upholstery is rubbed where the child seat sometimes sits. Carpet where the clutch would be if it was manual, looks like I took a razor to it. Molding on the rear right window is coming off. A/c stopped working just past warranty. They won't help to fix a/c system on 2-year-old car. Too bad-was going to upgrade to murano in 2 yrs. When daycare expenses decrease.",0
247,"Worst mistake I ever made in purchasing a car. It's a really nice car to look at but, that's it. The all plastic interior just reaks of cheap. The front windshield has you leaning up into the steering wheel to see when the red light changes. No console and thus no decent storage space. The little thing they put on the dash is very lacking. The seats are uncomfortable. The space between you and the passenger is almost non existant. Really cramped feeling. No console between seats and the cup holders are the worst I have ever seen in any vehicle. The arm rest sit too low to be of any use. Window control location is very poor. Rear seat room is very poor.",0
248,"Loved the car for the frist 15K then the problems started happening. struts, valve bodie, alignment (still not fixed and dealership won't do anything about it) wishield waher fluid tank leaking had to be replaced, horn malfunction, rear window came of of track. these are too many problems for someone who takes good care of their car. aslo it BURNS oil! after 5k of the recommended 10k oil change intervals i'm over 2qts low, VW says thats normal? I have just under 25k on the car and have decided to say goodbye. I could not have imagined this, the car was PERFECT for the first 15K... if buying used watch out for the alignment problem, very comom i'm told.",0
249,"Nice looking truck but way too many serious issues in two years. SW issue that causes battery to drain, when the battery drains with this particular issue then call a flat-bed. Front right axle seal leak (can't be truly fixed as this is a design issue...just keep replacing the same gasket every time it starts leaking!) 4-wheel driver failure. Front transfer case bearing failure...special order for parts required. Rear plastic bumper loses 'shape' on the bottom within one year...looks very cheap. Very frustrating.",0
250,"I have now had 5 Ford F-250 or Ford F- 350 diesel trucks. I tow trailers and use my trucks for work everyday. I have loved all of my Ford trucks until this 2008. This truck is junk. The 2005 Ford F-350 was one of the best trucks I have ever owned. It had tremendous power and fuel mileage pulling my 48' trailer the way I drive at around 11 mpg. The 2008 model gets 5.9 mpg. I have had 2 radiators replaced. The exhaust system has had numerous repairs with most dealers not knowing what to do. It repeating will go into exhaust clean at idle with my foot on the brake and will lurch forward. Ford continues to tell me it will not do this. I have discussed this problem with Ford, I am tired of Ford.",0
251,I have had nothing but trouble with the fuel system I contacted Dodge and they know of the problems but refuse to fix them I was told I could watch a dvd if I had any questions the problem arose with the blue tech after I bought the truck (with all blue techs) to fix it you have to dive 45 min for 45 mph w/o going under 45 mph and under 2000 rpm every week this with give you the truck terrible mpg and wear and tear on the truck for no reason I tell everyone I know do not buy Dodge because if something goes wrong it's your fault for buying their product if you don't have the time to waste 1 1/2 hours a weeks for no reason at all buy a Ford or Chevy look into it for yourself call any Dodge dealer,0
252,"I drove my Corolla for a year with the impression that it had a big-car feel and a very smooth feel (smoothest ever in fact). Then something broke, and the dealership has been unable to fix it. Now I do not feel safe driving on the interstate because if I hit even a small bump (and especially a series of small bumps) it feels like I am going to loose control. At slower speeds, it is just uncomfortable to drive on anything but the smoothest of roads. The dealership claimed to replace the front struts, and maybe they did because it did seem to reduce the rough feel for a 1-2 days.",0
253,"When I first saw the car I fell in love with it. Since then I wish I could divorce it! Horrible rattles, squeaks and poor workmanship. The car has already been in the shop for over 15 days here and there. I know VWs are known for their excellent craftsmanship but this car has loose dash parts, the black paint bubbling and peeling off of the unlock/lock buttons. Maybe mine's a lemon, but I would never recommend VW to anyone! I just hope my bonus is big enough to trade this piece of junk in! Too bad something that looks so good is so bad!",0
254,I like that way this car handles and that is what sold me. The repair problems have made me decide to get rid of this car after having had it only 10 months. It seems like it's hard to keep ahead of it falling apart. I have never had the misfortune to have ever gotten a car like this before.,0
255,"I've had my automatic Fit Sport for about 1 1/2 years and would not recommend it. Gas mileage is only about 28 in city. A/C bogs down engine power and can't cool consistently in heat of AZ summer - goes warm, cold, warm, cold. Inner upholstery is a lint magnet. Biggest peeve - Car is noisy and rattly over-all, with a major rattle inside the dash. Had this from the beginning, service can't seem to fix it. Visibility is poor with huge blind spots on front sides and very hard to see when backing up, especially if you are short like me. Tires go low on air, alignment goes out easily, engine making a high- pitched sound, service says they ""can't hear it."" Same for rubbing sound when turning left.",0
256,"It looks good, performs poorly. The gas mileage is 20-21 mpg City and 23 mpg Highway. CRV has Squeaks & Rattles in car. Vehicle shifts rough from 1st to 2nd from stop, start and go. The dealer says its in electronic program transmission. CRV Pulls hard to right on road at low/high speeds. I have been to a Honda Dealer who says there is a Honda Service Bulletin out Since 01/2007 prior to the car being purchased and requires New Steering column rods/pins to be later installed which are back ordered from Honda so a proper wheel alignment can been done on a new car, what?) I was Never notified by the selling dealer prior to or after purchase, So be alert for that. Noticeable wind noise at 55 mph",0
257,This van is louder than my 1 ton truck. Dealer said they all sound that way. Interior gets to easily dirty and scuffed. Van gets not much more mpg. Than my 1 ton 4 wd truck.,0
258,"You can actually see the fuel gauge move in this vehicle. I have owned vehicles in most all styles & from all different car companies over the past 40+ years. Up until I got this nitro with the 3.7 v-6, I have always loved Chrysler products. I was even a loyal Chrysler man back in the 1970's/ when ""build quality"" was just a word in the dictionary at Chrysler. Overall I am unhappy w/ this vehicle. I should have gotten the hemi, as it could not drink any more gas than this 3.7 does. This vehicle get the worse fuel economy of any of any vehicle that I have ever owned or driven. The 3.7 is also low on power, if you intend to make a pass, you better plan ahead & allow lots of room.",0
259,Love the car except the electronics. Console buttons shorted out from windex used to clean off finger prints. Really bad design as the buttons are not sealed and will short out with only a couple of drops. Audi will not stand behind. Cost $1000 to replace in the first 6 months. Afraid to use the cup holders that are located above the elect. 2 drops and another $1000. pule the hassle. Want my Range Rover back.,0
260,"After driving foreign built vehicles for the last 18 years, I came across this car at $3000 below blue book and bought it. Had I bothered to check that this garbage can had depreciated $15000 in 3 years, I would have passed. But alas, I didn't, and now I have the pleasure of fixing all the KNOWN GM design problems in the steering column, brake rotors, steering rack, and struts. I have had 1960 era cars with better steering and suspension systems. Of course because GMC is an American company, it is based on greed and not customer care; they refuse to fix/recall any of these problems because not enough people have died in the car. I look forward to the day when I can unload this lemon!",0
261,"Bought this piece of American junk in 08. So far the doors have needed work, the heater/ac blower motor works intermittently, the dealer of course cant find a problem. Just got the front brakes done at 23,000 miles. My guess is the use of sub grade materials, poor acceleration on highway, brake calipers frozen on rear brakes and dealership tells me it could be a week before they come in. My hope is Chrysler disappears from the business. I will never buy another. Completely sickened by the company and their unwillingness to fix any problem unless it's out of the warranty period. Bunch of crooks...",0
262,This is my second mini. The clutch went out in the first one after 2 1/ years years and only 22000 miles. The cause was determined to be a manufacture defect and was covered. My 2008 Mini S has only 10727 miles and is a standard transmission too. The clutch began slipping on this one. It is currently at the dealer and I am waiting to hear if the repairs are covered. I do not ride the clutch and do not drive aggressively or even need to shift that often (not a lot of stop and go traffic). I have read many posts on other sites about mini's and clutch problems. Buyer be ware!!!,0
263,"I purchased this brand new 2008 LE V6 at the end of 2008. Within a week the seat and steering wheel would vibrate when driving 65-75 on the highway 30 miles to get to work. Also had issues with the bluetooth. Brought in repeatedly. Eventually a TSB was sent out by Toyota regarding vibration/shudder after months of complaining, but it didn't completely resolve the issue. Toyota Rep insists it's the way Camry is designed. Had Honda's for 20 years, first toyota, incredibly disappointed. Do not feel safe. Also experience transmission hesitation as others.",0
264,"Bought a Freestyle limited June 2007 and almost a year later had to trade it in. From day one we had a constant gas smell. Took it in and half a tank of gas later could find no problem. Kept driving it and smell got worse. Mpg highway was around 18, City was 15 at best. Winter was terrible because it would get stuck in 1/2 inch of snow. We had the pebble leather and it reflected in the front window very badly.",0
265,"I loved this car... Now I just can't wait to give it back! Seems like the problems just get worse. Air bag light is always on ... Got tired of getting it fixed. Electric Windows seem to have a mind of their own. Then the wipers, lets just say I had to change the motor. Now I have a epc starting problems... That no one seems to be able to figure it out. After reading all these reviews has me worrying able my brake pads... I guess it will never end until I get rid of this car :(",0
266,"I have been driving this car for 3 months now. I average 22.5 MPG in mostly suburban driving, with a roundtrip distance to work of 20 miles each day. I also use it to deliver papers in every morning, which takes about 30 minutes. I use to do the same routine in a Honda Civic which had a larger engine and got 30 MPG. So I am very disapointed with the fuel economy. Even open road driving you can watch that gas gauge visibly drop. You cannot lock the driver side door except by using the key - this is a pain when you have bundles to carry and/or its raining.",0
267,First 2001 Highlander was superior to my 2008. Poor visibility. Seat is so uncomfortable hate to drive for any length of time. 2008 does not handle as well as prior model. No traction in the snow. Mine is an AWD 6 cyl. Interior parts fall off. Very disappointed with 2008 Highlander.,0
268,"I will never buy another VOLVO. This car has had the engine replaced, new brakes, roof squeaks and master computer went. The car in 2 years old and has ony 10,000 miles The biggest waste of $49,000!!! Stay clear of this car",0
269,Looks good and feels good. The bells and whistles could be better quality. Not enough power. Transmission seems to have problems finding gears. My check engine light has come on 3 times. Most frustrating is the car leaks when it rains! the car is now rusting inside from it. the car has been in for service 3 times and they still have not fixed it right.,0
270,"I bought this XD with the auto trans, that was the first mistake. This thing scares the heck our of me while trying to merge into 70 mph traffic. Road noise is excessive and the ride is rather bumpy. The brakes are adequate but spongy. Highway mpg is not too bad at 38 but local driving is a dismal 23 mpg. Rear passenger space is surprisingly adequate for average sized people. Rear storage space is small but this a sub compact and is to be expected. The hubcaps had to go. I bought 7 spoke wheels that look much better.",0
271,"Perfectly fine vehicle to get from point A to point B. The ride was fairly smooth compared to other cars in the segment. I like the brisk acceleration. The doors had a good solid feel. This is the first car to get me car sick as a drive as the car rolled around in fast turns. I only averaged 28 mpg on the highway with the Sentra. This was probably due to the ride height, springy gas pedal and CVT config. Nissan still needs to improve their build quality. Plastic looked like they came out of a generic brand toy. Bottom line, you can get better driving dynamics, build quality, fuel economy or value with a Corolla, Civic or a Mazda3.",0
272,"I did my research, and discounted the Fit, Yaris etc in favour of the Versa bc of horsepower, room and the Nissan reputation. It exceeded all my expectations at first - fun to drive, reliable, good fuel economy, easy to handle. Then winter hit. In cold, wet weather, I would come out to the car and find ice all over the dash, controls and inside of the windows and windshields. The controls wouldn't work and the doors wouldn't shut. Warming it up - no change. Getting it fixed at the dealer proved extremely problematic ie. didn't happen - cost to me to fix was quoted at $5-10K. I just traded it in for a 2009 model - hoping for better this time around. It'll likely be my last Nissan too.",0
273,"Bought this 10 months ago and am looking to trade it in even though I know I will take a loss. has tons of cargo space and leg room, but the motor works too hard. Doesn't feel like it shifts properly. Not very darty--takes a long time to accelerate. Gas mileage for me has been consistently at 18 miles and less. I have never gotten even 19 mile per gallon as stated. 14 gallon tank is small--feels like I am always at the gas station. radio and amenities are positioned well for a comfy ride. Great heat and A?C but is hard to hear radio over it--not strong speakers",0
274,This corvette has been a nightmare. The first thing was the top creaks when hot and has been to the shop 4 times and still not fixed. Both front sway bar links had to be replaced and the entire rack and pinion. The drivers bottom seat panel has to be replaced and the battery has been replaced. The problems just keep mounting and for a car that costs this much I would have expected better quality.,0
275,"I am very disappointed with the engine & automatic transmission design. There is a very bad dead zone in the acceleration in 1st from a dead stop. The top squeals when coming up. The maintenance is free but when they don't fix anything it's worthless. The repair shop isn't familiar with the car and can't fix problems. I have had to go back 4 or 5 times before something gets fixed. They have even lied, actually fixed something and said on the repair sheet that there was nothing was wrong. I would not recommend anyone buy this Car with an automatic. The rear view is cluttered and very dangerous to back up. The automation in the controls is stupid, mostly unnecessary and very annoying",0
276,"This is my first jeep. I bought it because of price and fuel economy. We had a snowy winter, and it handles well in snow. I have a toddler, so the plastic back on the seats and the YES fabric work great. Controls are in odd spots, and that took some getting used to. Window noise from rear windows is annoying. Seats are uncomfortable, and the arm rest is terrible, cup holders very inconvenient. For the second time in a month, the power windows have failed. All four windows get stuck down, the controls get some working after repeated effort. Rear driver never responded, stuck down. In zero degree weather with a toddler, a real problem. Today it did it again- thinking of trading...",0
277,"Don't buy. Unfindable can't-fix-it interior rattles & bumps and rough highway pavement. Balky starts from standstill - drivers new to car stall in traffic again and again. Seatbelt alarm makes punishing howl six times if one doesn't buckle up before starting car, so one must first open door with key, put down key down, buckle up, then pick up key and start car. Forget to do it and get punished by ugly noise. There is no sound insulation at all - hear every noise in wheel wells. Seat back mechanism to enter rear does not go back to position so seat backs must be readjusted each time. NO LUMBAR SUPPORT. Less than average directional stability. This car stinks.",0
278,"I'm a bit disappointed with my 07 SI Sedan. I've had several problems with it. Tons and tons of interior rattles that can never be fixed, buzzing in the speakers, and now my 2nd gear is grinding like crazy. 2nd and 3rd gear issues are VERY common on these cars, and I'm now having trouble engaging 2nd gear at high RPMs, which is where the SI lives. The car is fun to drive, although it doesn't deliver what it should for its price. At almost 5k cheaper, you get the cobalt SS/ion redline with more performance. For a mere 1-2 thousand more, you get the mazdaspeed3/GTI which has a LOT more spunk and refinement to it. I would suggest checking out the Mazdaspeed3/gti before buying the Honda, sadly.",0
279,"I am electrician and service eastern n.c. I keep record of all gas used. In 3 mo 13,000 miles and 400 gal = 32.5 mpg that's 95% hwy. I have gotten in one tank 27 mpg to 43 mpg in another tank. Most tanks average 30-32 hwy driving on the flatside of Raleigh nc to nc coast. My best hwy mpg has been driving Raleigh nc west to winston- salem nc. I have had it to dealer 4 times and they say computer said everything is working properly. I got the car for the high mpg. gas prices are my enemy. I owed a 91 civic and got 37 mpg. Wish I still had it.",0
280,"It's a nice vehicle but here are the bad things. Heat takes about 10 minutes til you can turn it on, anytime you turn on the climate controls it defaults to air conditioning (the most annoying feature). If you have the Bo speaker system, your subwoofer is mounted on top of the spare tire, so be prepared to take that off when you are broken down on the side of the road. Other then that I like everything else on the car, I know one review said it doesn't have fog lights but mine does, took me awhile to find them. Headlights are also adjustable if they look dim. Upgraded sound system sounds awesome, and it has XM radio! Dealer, Salesman and bestbuy guy that installed my XM all didn't know it.",0
281,"Have had this car for 1 year and what a mistake. Should have stayed w/Hyundai Accent but they didn't offer a 4dr hatch. Have had a constant speed sensor problem on the auto trans. The car is slow, handles poorly in the snow and less than good gas mileage. Avg 28 combined city/hywy. Should get better mileage w/such a small engine.",0
282,"I expected more from this car. I've had it for about 9 months, engine has to be broken in by now but the mileage is terrible. Barely get 400km on a tank and thats 50/50 city, hiway. I don't drive that hard either. My friends with domestic v6's get something close to that. It is fun to drive, kind've like a go-cart but because of all the little things, I'm considering trading it in for something else. The auto tranny doesn't work for this underpowered engine either, there's too much downshifting going on at the slightest hint of throttle. I wish I did more research rather than be blinded by the fact that it was a new Honda. BTW the orange colour doesn't work too well for this car.",0
283,"Purchased the vehicle brand new from dealership. At 18k started hearing screeching noise from front tires. Outcome? Complete brake overhaul from calipers, rotors and brake pads, all needed replaced. Dealership said there was no reported issue even though I showed them pages and pages of customer complaints about the brakes. I did this out of my own pocket for the safety of my family. Now before warranty expires the transmission is slipping. We took to dealer said there was a recall and fixed right? Wrong? Today wife had to take back to dealer, $95 bucks to look at it since no longer under warranty. Rental out of my pocket and the outcome is still TBD...... Terrible experience.",0
284,"But this time I promise never to buy another piece of c**p from Chrysler ever again! Antiquated engine and transmission. Lumber wagon ride and handling, really poor mileage from the very old design PUSHROD engine that has been around since 1989! And talk about quality, it is not anywhere to be found! Misfitting dashboard, poor assembly, mismatched colors, really bad leather that appears fake in the way it wears and fades. We bought it new and the depreciation really hit hard. Sold it for penny's on the dollar! Avoid at all costs, it does not even belong in a rental car fleet!",0
285,"I have owned the last three versions of the Grand Prix and each one has become more technologically advanced and stylish than the last while build quality and interior design has become progressively inferior. My 2007 Grand Prix pales in comparison to the interior design and materials in my 2000. Mesh-like headliner and sun visor material scream ""cheap."" The plastic interior pieces are visually and physically ""hard"". The carpet is coarse and the leather doesn't even smell like leather. Heck, I'm a Grand Prix lover and I'm embarassed for GM. It would seem that the Grand Prix has been allowed to suffer the same agonizing death as its Pontiac brothers. Sorry GM, my next car will be Japanese.",0
286,Bought my Mini new in 2/08 and the fuel pump went out at 17000 miles. Although it was covered under warranty I can only guess what troubles lie ahead. I also had to replace one of the run flat tires to the tune of $249. The car is fun to drive and I have adequate space since I no longer have young kids to transport. But once I experience a major mechanical failure I start looking for a new car. I plan to buy a new Honda or Toyota in 2/10.,0
287,"This is our second BMW, we are so disappointed with the quality of construction. The front bumper, a pathetic piece of plastic just buckled and fell when going over a bump. Told by a BMW service agent that this is happening so frequently with the x3 that people are not even bothering to fix the bumper, they just drive around with it hanging. This is unconscionably poor construction, design and quality. There are other issues with the quality of materials used in the construction of this car. This is definitely our last BMW and if it wasn't a lease, I would get rid of it immediately.",0
288,"My check engine light has been on 3 times since March, two dealers cannot find the problem, so they reset the computer and send me on my way. And my leather seat was defective, that has been replaced. Did I mention my bluetooth has been replaced also, all of this before the 6,000 miles mark. What a lemon. If you own a Nissan, good luck if you have a warranty issue.",0
289,While this is a pretty neat auto the road noise will take away many points. We traded a 2004 Ford Explorer on this car mainly because of the horrible road noise we got with the Ford. We have a neat new auto with almost the same tee same level of noise. We did not notice on the 2 test drives as both days were extremely windy. The dealer now tells me that there is no insulation on this vehicle as it is considered in the Civic family. We were told that the top end Accord and Oddessy would have insulation and be much quieter. Great! The fuel economy is not that great for a 4 cylinder either.,0
290,"This Jeep's top leaked since day 1. It has been in to be repaired 6 times and out of service more than 30 days. I have filed under lemon law /and was given a mediator /with no resolution. 5 months later I was forced into buying a foreign used car so I could get to work. I do not recommend this Jeep to any! Chrysler does not back product, they sure can sell you a car, but service is not there anymore. Stay away",0
291,"When I first drove the car I fell in love with it and immediately bought it. The very responsive engine coupled with 18"" performance tires made this car fun to drive. Just two months later and the clutch has way too much transmission feel and the gas consumption is not even close to the quoted technical specifications. Unless my dealer can solve the consumption issue I am estimating that this car will cost me $400-500 more per year than I should expect based on quoted estimates. In terms of the clutch, the feel has drastically changed from when I first took delivery. My dealer is claiming that it is operating normally. I hope this is not a sign of things to come.",0
292,Too much plastic. Window gears gave up at 2100. Soft as a truck and hard as a sedan - pick one and stay with it if you're GM. Gave it back to corporate HQ before 3500 miles. Got myself another Taurus!,0
293,"My biggest dissapointment with this car is gas mileage. Granted, I am averaging about 38 MPG, but nowhere near the stated 51 MPG. I could have bought a Chevy Aveo or Honda Fit for much less money. Quality is surprisingly poor - had to take car to dealer for leaks around the hatch area several times. Car is very uncomfortable for long trips- OK for jaunts around town. Seats are very hard and unsupportive. Performance is very iffy especially merging on freeways. When pressed too hard you get the feeling that the thing is about ready to break. Great second or third car, but not adequate for all- around duty.",0
294,"I purchased my 2008 Avenger in April 2008. I am very disappointed with it. I have 12,478 miles on it. Brakes grind, door and side pannels creek like crazy...cant find that problem to fix, Im on my 4th mygig radio(Keeps Freezing up). Sluggish tranny(4cyl). Front noises when you turn or go over a bump. AC doesnt work well, numerous blind spots, chrome plasic around shifter inside blinds driver, poorly designed trunk pours water into the trunk when wet and many many more just running out of room. PLEASE DO NOT BUY ONE.JUNK This is just the worst car I have ever owned. Back in 1997 I had a brand new avenger and loved it so I thought I would take a chance with the 2008. What a mistake.",0
295,"I loved driving my used 2001 Limited Edition PT Crusier but was having some problems with it come 2007 so I decided it was time for a new one..despite the previous problems I had, I figured buying a brand new one I wouldn't have any problems, so I purchased a brand new Cruiser on January 1, 2008. Do you think it's been a joy? Not one bit! I have had nothing but problems since day one! It has been in for balancing over 3 times, the tires have been indexed multiple times, and now it squeaks when I go over anything that makes the car bouce. It's so annoying! Body creaks shouldn't be happening on a less then one year old car! I am over my car and will never buy a Chrysler again!",0
296,I purchased this car a year ago and have been extremely unhappy with the performance in the winter. If it snows less or more than an inch of snow the car will not move it does nothing but spin. It also was parked on a lawn and had to be towed out for it would only spin up mud and not move. I have brand new all season radial on this car and still it cant get out of its own way. The rack that is provided by the factory is terrible I am scared to put my kayaks on them for fear that the rack is to weak & it will break under the pressure. It also does not go wide enough to accomodate the length of the kayaks. Over all this vehicle is to light for the maine winters and I have been very unhappy.,0
297,Bought car 3 months ago and I've had it in for service 5 times in the last month and a half for a squealing problem it makes when I first turn it on in the morning. Very unhappy with the dealership and service techs at van dyn hoven for not fixing what seems like a simple problem and offering a loaner vehicle. Gas mileage is less than 20 mpg's. Sunglasses holder to small and doesn't fit glasses. Fuel door broke off already when my husband bumped it with his arm when putting fuel in. Made of cheap plastic. Headrest and armrest are also awkward for me.,0
298,"I use my Ridgeland off road a good amount. I regularly smell burning grass after drivng down dirt roads with grass growing in the middle. I have had a serious fire in the engine compartment which caused over $5,000 of damage. I have had one other small fire which I put out with a garden hose. There is a connection around the exhaust pipe that catches grass and leaves which smolder and/or catch fire. You may remember the Honda ads during the last March Madness showing a ""herd"" of Ridgelines crossing a field of tall grasses. That was a brush fire in the making. This pickup is safe in the mall parking lot, but don't go near the grass. Honda has been unresponsive.",0
299,"After several very positive experiences with Toyota, I came up with a downer. Quite evident, the more Toyota grows, the more it has taken some quality control out of there vehicles. I have 6k miles on mine and have an off and on noise that happens at 75-80 (dealer can't diagnose 'cause they can only drive it up to 70), front dash rattles, passenger door rattles and has had to be towed as it wouldn't start (Thank God I purchased the extended service plan otherwise I would have been really irked paying for towing on a 3 month old truck). I wouldn't mind a littler better mileage but it's not bad. Power is good for a V6 and comfort is good as well. I still like it but wish it were better.",0
300,"The rear Differential broke 2 times within 2 weeks and 700 miles on the car! The power steering is jittery, They also installed the ski rack on wrong and The bike rack is too high on the car to even put a bike up there. This car is nothing but problems and poor design. Also the extended warranty has about 3 pages of what it doesn't cover, and only 1 paragraph of what it does cover and maybe when you will use the $1000 dollar warranty, it may cover a radio now if you're lucky.. When I got my car back from the dealer it seems like the 4wd doesn't even work.",0
301,"Since day one I am having transmission problems. The dealer keeps on saying there is nothing wrong with the vehicle, but there is. It slows down too quickly when your foot is removed from the gas pedal. Sooner or later I will be rear-ended. I am in arbitration now. I was told by a Toyota the tech to drive aggressively. That is against the law. As of now I am due for an arbitration hearing.",0
302,I bought a 2008 Dodge Caliber last October within a month of purchasing it I had it in the shop. The transmission is horrible. Anytime I got to stop or start it jolts and spudders like it is about to stall. Called Dodge apparently some Calibers have this problem others do not. Also they said there is no fix! Than went back to have front struts replaced and to look and trans again and again no fix! Now the problem seems to happen when in reverse. I'm really not happy with this vehicle.,0
303,"We bought this car for the advertized fuel economy and to buy American. I alway buy AWD, but thought FWD would be fine and thought mild increase in fuel economy would be good. Wrong!This car can't get out of it's own way in the snow. It's so heavy in the rear there is no weight on the front tires. Forget about pulling onto a street after a snowstorm. The MPG is 15.5 at best. You can get near the 24 on the highway if you don't exceed 65 MPH. All in all, 15.5 is not 16-24 that they advertize. I am a sad consumer when 2 of the three reasons I bought it were a fraud.",0
304,"This car has blown repeated computers, ohms regulator, the air conditioner blower replaced, the cup holder has jammed into the dash, the trunk leaks, the motor already has a 'knocking sound'. It has literally been in the shop nearly as much as in my garage. Can't get it repaired timely because they apparently don't make the parts until there is a problem. If this is a car you need to be dependent on, don't buy it. If you have the patience to work with the mechanics, go for it, its beautiful, but I'd recomend waiting until the next line comes out, my car seems to be a 'beta' test version.",0
305,"At 54, this was my very first new car...ever! Everyone said what great cars Hondas are, so I was excited to be buying one, and my beloved Element to boot. At 1000 miles it had been in the shop twice for fuel tank sensor issues. Now at just shy of a year and only 5700 miles I am truly disappointed. It IS fun to drive and I love its funny nerd cool look, but the quality really lacks....small irritations: defrosters are non- existent, radio speakers vibrated from the start, driver's side doors rattle. I'm a single old guy, so it's hardly been given rough treatment.",0
306,"I loved this great looking vehicle on the road! Loved it, loved it, loved it! Until I purchased it! I was very disappointed the very first day! I could feel every tiny bump on the road, the steering wheel is very tight, therefore it's not very easy to maneuver. I also couldn't adjust the seat into a comfortable position, and was suffering from the back pain until I got used to it. I am 5,6"" and I guess this car is not for shorties. Moms, beware! The metal anchors are so deep, it took me about 20 minutes to install the car seat! Right now I got used to the car, love all other features: Bluetooth, tech pack, back-up camera and keyless entry, but will be looking for another one soon.",0
307,My driver's side door latch keeps coming loose and making a clunking sound when I go over even the smallest of bumps. The dealer has repaired it 5 times and the noise came back again. I'm in the process of taking the car to Lemon law arbitration to force the dealer to give me my money back. Jim in MA,0
308,"I chose the C70 over an Audi due to the hardtop. I have had it in the shop seven times and 90 days since May '08 for roof issues. Fortunately none of them have been major, but a major inconvenience on my time. My biggest problem has been getting anyone from Volvo corporate to give me a call to discuss some kind of resolution.",0
309,"I loved the look of the new Escalade and alas that is all the car is. Just something good to look at. But it is a mechanical nightmare. This truck looks, drives and feels like it was put together in a hurry. I only have 2500 miles on it and the tranny bucks like a horse at least 3 times a day. Cadillac has reprogrammed some kind of computer but it keeps doing it and they say that there is nothing that they can do to fix it. It also idles very rough, the first month we had it it was fine and now it vibrates so badly at stop lights that it is embarrassing. Cadillac told me to use premium, I have and it still does it.Sometimes the power lift gate does not want to work. Should've gotten a 08 Sequoia",0
310,"We were so happy when we bought our Acadia. Great looks, power, and felt solid. After we bought the car we learned how bad the fuel economy was. I also noticed the hesitation up hills. Throttle response is terrible if you step on it. At 8,000 miles check engine light came on. Service center told us fuel cap and camshaft problem? Camshaft? Only 8,100 miles on this car.",0
311,"After a year of research and test driving various SUVs and crossovers we settled on the HH and decided to order exactly what we wanted. We had test driven several HH and other hybrids and all were quiet, but none impressed us like the HH. When our HH came in we were excited. It was beautiful and had everything we wanted, except for the NOISE! When we brake to slow down it sounds like a jet engine winding down. It also has a click. We were expecting the quiet we had experienced with the other HHs we drove, but were greatly disappointed. The dealership has told us that some hybrids have that noise more than others - it is normal. I won't order again. I buy what I test drive on the lot.",0
312,"My boyfriend bought the van over a year ago for him and his kids. He was sold on the ""safety feature"" that said that any obstruction would automatically open the side door. Since then we have constantly had problems with the power doors-- if you are on any type of incline, the power doors have a great chance of not closing as well as sliding forward on their own. His 9 year old son has actually had his hand crushed in the doors (that DID NOT automatically open) when he was reaching to grab his seat belt to buckle in as the door closed. Both of his children are now terrified of the closing doors and warn their friends to not touch the doors. I am almost 30 and even I get nervous about it.",0
313,"I commute 120 miles a day, so gas mileage was of paramount importance. I have always owned Hondas and loved them-except for this one. The passenger/driver sun visors have broken 3 times. The paint is blistering and peeling off the bumpers. The windshield is VERY long, prone to cracking and the sun visor will take up what little cargo space there is. The rear child tethers are so close to the seat, you cannot use them. I was informed today the brakes need replacing every 20-25,000 miles since all the 2008 have a new brake system to eliminate braking noise that results in 1/2 the usual brake life. I'd rather have the noise...and a different car. $300 every 8 months is pricey.",0
314,For the past 9 years I have had an ML320 and was persuaded to trade it on a new Lexus. So I get the RX 350 and all I can say about it is that the fit and finish are great. For the rated horsepower it seems to underperform. I was used to a car that was much heavier with a lower horsepower rating that outperformed this dog. All I can say about the handling is that it reminds me of an old man car like the old Buick LaSabre. Very boring and no feel of the road. If you own an M Class hold on to it and treasure it.,0
315,"We purchased this car thinking we would never have another new car since we are retired and getting old and wont be driving that many years. The wind noise in this car is so bad we can't talk. We have taken it back to dealer any number of times. First they said Nissan was working on the problems and to come back in a month, we did that, after 3 trips to dealership we are getting that is a characteristic of this car and nothing can be done about it. We are very unhappy with the way we have been treated. I am really not just an old woman trying to grip, we do have a problem and can not get any one to help us. All I can say don't buy a Nissan Rouge, it is a waste of good money.",0
316,"Let me start by saying, I like the van and this is my second one. But the new design has a whistling sound when doing 65-70 MPH. The problem is around the windshield on the unit, Between the window and the pillar that extends to the roof. The rubber insert is not long enough and it causes a whistle sound. You will need to tape the outside until you can run a thin bead of caulk under the rubber to prevent the wind from getting in. I do a lot of driving in a year (42,000 annually) and I currently have it taped and it has stopped the noise. Good luck.",0
317,"I bought a kia rio sedan in 2008 have had a new transmission put in to date still having problems with transmission automatic shift from park reverse or drive to revervse is very slow I am left seating in the road waiting for it transmission to shift I feel this is a safety issue and kia should correct it after many many time taking it to shop they tell me I dont know have to drive and there is nothing wrong with my car, it is the worst car I have ever had will not buy another one nor would I recommend anyone else to buy one.",0
318,"Have had nothing but issues. I take it in at least once a month to be fixed, mainly with Brakes and Power steering. Brakes replaced twice fixed four times. First set of brakes were replaced at 9,000 miles. Power steering sensor fixed once then replaced once because it would lock on me while Id drive. Feel very unsafe in this car. Dealership won't do anything for me. Trying to argue the MI Lemon Law with Pontiac Corp. Have also had issues with tire pressure. Let's just say, I will never get a GM again... doing everything I can to get out of this lease!!",0
319,"I bought this Silverado classic ext cab 2wd in oct 06 for 25k. Trade value now is 6500. Two reasons, the first is the 4.3 vortec v-6. It is way underpowered. The transmission grinds and tries to shift too much between 35- 40 mph. I had the transmission replaced at 30 K (unacceptable). I wanted to give GM another shot after driving Fords for so long. I will not do it again. Vehicle rides good and I get about 17.5 mpg around town.",0
320,"17K, add engine oil light came on. Noted to be 2 qts low. Thought this was odd since too new for this to occur. 22K, light came on again. Dealer stated ""not uncommon to burn thru a quart or 2 in the break in period. Funny. Light has come on at least 8 times. Burned thru 12+ qts in the past 10K. Dealer has done pressure test, die test (although they never finalized procedure as they claimed they did), checked valve springs for knicks (according to TSB). No oil coming out of tailpipe and no leaks what so ever. Dealer keeps telling me to put on more miles. No resolution to date. I'm done! Have seen others with same problem on the web. Do not recommend this vehicle & MPG stinks",0
321,"Transmission hesitation/performance is a glaring design issue. At times the tranny acts as it doesn't know what gear it is suppose to be in. Which negatively effects MPG. Currently gettng 14-15 city and 16-18 highway. Dealer installed software update but no help. Another update is available but told it would cost me 3-4 MPG and once installed ut can't be backed out! Have had 9 other Buicks and loved them all. This car, once you look past its beauty is a big dissappointment. Would not recommend until GM permanently fixes the tranny issues. Dealer does acknowledge this is an issue.",0
322,"I just purchase a 2008 commander and I am having water leaking through even when I just use wipers the hand rails near window. Going into speakers. Short, crackle sound, right side speaker don't work. Who knows where water is traveling now! Also, when driving can hear wind through windshield. Hard to see through rear window with rear back seats up, don't use it.I can't really rate the vehicle to much, since it's only been a month, so far not good.",0
323,"I purchased a 2007R/T in Feb. A manager was driving it. It has 6700 on it now. It. Making a chattering noise from the front end. At times it seems to get louder. Two dealerships called Chrysler and they know about the problem? But they don't what it is and they don't know how to fix it? They say it is safe to drive? How do they know if they don't know what's wrong, or fixing it?",0
324,"My previous model ESV 2004, had features that I felt made it a luxury vehicle. The 2008 seats are hard, do not hold you in position when cornering. The sun visor is poor. Previous model had more flexibility. Headrest ability to bend forward is now seriously lacking. I happened apparently to be one of the few people that used the disc changer system under random ALL. Since the addition of the backup camera this feature has been removed. This last item damed near stopped the purchase. I now wish that I had purchased a Mercedes GL 550. Which at this point in time will be my next purchase; and most likely sooner than later. This is my 10th new Cadillac purchase in a row.",0
325,"Poor handling at high speed. Car shakes at high speed. Car seems to float at 80 mph. Very top heavy in curves. Car tight into curves, loose in the center and loose out of curves. Car performance seems to go away during after being driven through out day. Low gear is too high, poor performance at start. A/C fan blower very low. Door locks should lock when car is in gear.",0
326,"Had an '03, loved it. From the specs the '08 should be even better. It is in every way except the ride. If you're on smooth blacktop fine, any other surface you will feel via the seat each tar strip, pavement crack, bump, and if you hit a hole... oh my! I drive 55 Ca. freeway miles a day. Hate the ride every mile. Suspension way too stiff for Toyota's luxury flagship, just jar & jolt. 17"" wheels don't help either. 16"" means more absorbing rubber and a softer ride. They need to quit trying to build cars to satisfy the specification desires of some auto magazines testers whose standards are usually race track handling, the biggest wheels & lots of hpwr. The Avalon isn't a sports car!",0
327,"Our 3rd Audi. This one is just not up to what we had expected. Example - the gas door feels and works like a Yugo. Instrument panel is directly under cup holders and any spills screw up the audio. $800 to fix and not covered by warranty. Service has declined dramatically over the years. It feels like they are trying to wring every dime they can from us at every chance. Not much different than most but different than our past experience. Have had for 1.5 years and seems like there is always some little thing wrong. Engine is great, great on snow. If I had it to do over again I would get the GL 450 or 550. The Acura is more reliable but does not drive as well or turn as sharply.",0
328,"I got this car in place of a Porsche 911 S and believe me, this car is no Porsche. It's huge for a ""sports car"". A sports car is supposed to be small, powerful and nimble. The Vette's handling is comparable to an elephant trying to perform on the balance beam at the Olympics. Sure, I like the power under the hood. 30 horses with the dual mode exhaust sounds great, but that's about the only thing that's great on this car. After driving BMW's, Z cars, Porsche's and even my Mercedes E350, I am very disappointed in the way this car's handing and appointments are for the money. Can't anyone in the U.S. build a ""sports car"" at least in the league of the afore mentioned. Pitiful.",0
329,"We've owned many domestic vehicles and decided to step-up to the 'superior' quality of a Honda. What a disappointment! The first year was okay with the vehicle however it's now falling apart. Performs poorly in the cold, if it starts at all. Don't think of driving in winter weather without snow tires. The alarm is toast. The electronics are on the fritz. Seat belts don't retract. Weather stripping is worn through. Loud clunk in the trunk area when making turns. Has a severe shake when approaching highway speeds. Hard to find a comfortable driving position. Overall, the most disappointing vehicle we've ever owned! Will never buy a Honda again.",0
330,"I've owned 10 vehicles over the last 25 years and the CLS550 is unquestionably the biggest disappointment. Bottom line - I've got an $80,000+ luxury vehicle with all the bells and whistles that drives like a 1972 Fiat. Despite being in the shop 3 times in the first 90 days, the vehicle continues to violently rattle and vibrate, the ""premium sound system"" sounds like a transistor radio, and the ""climate controlled seats"" are nothing more than a weak fan with an imperceptable effect. Two thumbs down!",0
331,"Buyer beware. I am very disappointed. The most troublesome problem with the car is that there is a significant, and very distracting, vibration in the steering wheel, driver?s seat, and middle console when the car is at a resting idle. This alone makes me dislike this car. The car has been in for service 3 times. American Honda Corp?s position on the problem is that it is within manufacturing standards. There is also a significant vibration in the steering wheel and roughness at highway speeds. The road noise is loud. This car does NOT get 34 mpg, 30 at best. I would not buy this car again. I would recommend you test drive multiple cars and read many customer reviews.",0
332,"I guess I expected more from my first BMW. My wife hated the way it drove around town, so now it's mine. The transmission is definitely a design flaw and there should be a recall. On the highway it rides like a dream. It's like riding on a rail and it takes discipline to stay below 100 mph. I had a lifter noise and after several visits to service, they had to replace the cylinder head. That was another nightmare. The dealer and BMW should have made a better effort to compensate for my inconvenience.",0
333,Makes clunk noise as you pull forward every time (sounds like transmission) and several times we were told that was normal. Now it is being looked at. Brakes squeeled and entire neighborhood laughed at new truck when backing up. Now has squeal in steering when turning either direction and car only has 7200 miles on it. Hate it already. Don't know what will happen next.,0
334,"I have had my Rabbit for 2 years and have loved driving it. The problem with this car is that, when something happens to it (or even when you need an oil change), you'll be put in the poor house. Beware, the Rabbit is very high-maintenance and pricey once off-the-lot. I was lightly rear-ended, small dent: $900. I drove a dirt road leading to a mountain hiking trail and hit a bump, transmission needs to be replaced: $7000. Even an oil change: $90. I will be saving the $7000 needed to put in a new transmission and choosing a reliable, low-maintenance Japanese car, like I had before.",0
335,"The styling of the car is impressive as it has the lines of a much more expensive car. The ride has been disappointing. Very bumpy and not driver friendly at highway speeds. I was willing to overlook the firm ride if highway stability was solid but that's just not the case. The transmission has a tendency to shift up at low RPM (1K-2K) leaving normal acceleration feeling tired. Although, the 6cyl is very responsive if you step on it or use the paddle shifter instead.",0
336,"After having waited for this car, and paying for the upgrades, i feel like my money went down the drain. Day 1, pick up the car, leave the dealership, and there is a popping noise from the suspension, the cd player was broken. Took the car in found that the suspension needed to be fixed, the front tires had to be replaced and the cd player among other items. A month into ownership, the car starts making all kinds of rattles, and loud noises when coming to a stop. Cat was replaced and many clips and molding in the car. Transmission started popping out of third gear, that is still being worked on. All in all, Honda has done over 9K of warranty work on the car already!",0
337,"My chief complaint of this car is it has no locking glove compartment. For God's sake Kia's have locking glove compartments. How do you turn your vehicle over to a valet? Presumably a Mercedes would likely visit valet parking more often than most? Add to that, access to the rear seats comes from lifting and pulling forward the rear seat. Cars half its price have electric motors that do it. Its like driving an old Euro taxi. Build quality, first year, 3rd brakelight lens cover fell out when trunk closed, whining belt pulley,seatbelt not retracting correctly. Wife's '06 E series needed new tranny first 3 months of owning. Not your daddys Benz.",0
338,"I got a lemon. My Escape was great for the first 6 months and now it seems to be in the shop every week. Back hatch mechanism failed twice, had to replace condenser motor because of a transmission leak. My temperature and door lock options on the convience package change on there own and ford has no fix yet. Fog lights are filling up with water and shorting out.",0
339,"When I purchased this car, I loved the features. Now, almost two years later, I regret buying it. While still very pretty, for a mini van, every thing is breaking. The rear cup holders, the rear sonar, the rear cover. Every little piece of plastic that can break is breaking. I could understand if I was hard on the vehicle. But it is mostly city driving, which the mileage is horrible, 11-13 miles per gallon.",0
340,"I bought the Tiburon new. I started having trouble with the tires right away. Had to air them up within first month, and every 6-8 weeks after that. Took it back to the dealer four times. They said no apparent leak, maybe a problem with the seal. So added nitrogen. 8 weeks later, a tire low again. Deal will not replace tire. Hyundai customer service says Hyundai is not responsible for defective tires, the tire manufacturer is. I purchased road hazard and extended warranty. Neither will cover defective tires. I don't feel safe driving the car.",0
341,"2nd Review, Now have 49000 miles on truck. For the first year only in the shop 13 times. 2 Radiators, Turbo controller, P/S idler pulley, A/C repair, Still smimmys when starting from stop. Trans now and again down shifts hard like I got rear ended. Dealer says no problem found. Goes into regen 3 to 5 times a day, sucks fuel while in regen. Dealer says, That is normal. Before computer up date, maybe regens 3 times a week. The truck has power, I am afraid to take off road. Will the radiator leak? Will I start a desert fire from the regen? Will I have to walk 60 miles because the truck broke down? My 2000 Ford f250 4X4 7.3L,(bought new), 268,000 miles in the shop 4 times.",0
342,"I got a really good deal on my Sentra, that's the good news. The rest is mostly negative. The driving position is very uncomfortable for me. I am an average size woman 5'6"" and I find the seats too small. If it was a purchase from any place other than a car dealership, I would have returned it for refund in the first week. But I'm stuck with it for years. It has been in the shop 5 times. The clutch makes a noise when depressed and again when released. The side windows rattle in their seals. After 2,500 miles, the Service Engine Soon light came on and the cruise control stopped working. I definitely should have spent more time test-driving this car and exploring other options!",0
343,"I like the gas mileage, ride,and handling but at 1100 miles I noticed that when I filled the gas tank the gas guage only went to 3 quarters full! Now at 2100 miles I have a check engine light and the code states that the fuel level sensor in the gas tank is no longer working! It's a disappointment to already be having problems at such a low mileage and I wonder if this is the start of things to come!",0
344,"Only 4K miles and now looking at a possible third transmission. Have been without the car for more than 5 weeks. An annoying rattle turned into a much larger problem: I would depress the clutch, the shifter would then pop out of gear into neutral without even touching it. Then, while driving and in gear, the shifter would simply pop out and into neutral. No clutch action necessary. Now on the second transmission. Very loud all around gearbox; difficult to shift--esp into third. Last night, went to start it: depressed clutch and stepped once on gas pedal and released: next thing I know, engine totally revs like I am still stepping on the gas! SCARY! I just want a replacement--auto trans now!",0
345,"Have a 1998 GS 400. Have owned/leased at least 5 others since 1993. This one does not live up to the hype. Extremely annoying feeling of gas- electric-gas kickin/out etc. at speeds around 59 mph. Miniscule trunk. I am currently attempting to get out from under this ""Edsel"". PS: the mileage is really only a 4-5 mpg better than my GS 400.",0
346,"Not exactly the low-cost of ownership vehicle advertised. I just had to replace brake pads @ 9,900 miles to the tune of $270 out of pocket. I've owned many new cars in my lifetime and never replaced pads under 10k miles. This was a disappointing experience, so I have written a letter to American Honda. There are other similar complaint visible on the web. Honda needs to make improvements to the brake pad materials. Other than this, the car is comfortable, fun to drive and fuel efficient.",0
347,"This is not a bad car at all setting aside from numerous dealership visits within the 25k miles I have clocked with this vehicle. The engine is very smooth, quiet yet not as powerful as I would like, even with the manual transmission. The down points for this car is various suspension noises & horrible manual transmission/factory flywheel combo. At about 5000 miles, the manual transmission had to be replaced. Right after, various TSB's were performed for interior noises & passenger side front A-Pillar head air bag cover was replaced. Now I hear clanking in the suspension area when going over any type of bump or road imperfection. Also, interior plastic clips are getting loose which make noise.",0
348,"I did a lot of research to see what new car I wanted to buy. I decided on the Impala. Had a 72 and loved it. After taking my time and looking around I finally bought the 08 Impala. But, am having touble with the brakes. Had them redone and the day after they were as bad if not worse then before I had them worked on. Pulsate when stopping and jerks me back and forth until stopped. The front axle seal had to be fixed was leaking. Had an emission sensor go out and fixed. OnStar is not working properly the dealership is reviewing the recall papers to see what needs to be fixed. Seats are very uncomfortable. Very disappointed. I did the research and got stuck. Oh, the glove box broke.",0
349,"For the upper end of Impalas, this has been a real joke. The rattles and windshield leaks make you feel like you're watching an outdoor concert of bad music. Hit a pothole and OnStar wants to know if everyone in the car is OK--even though they think I'm about 80 miles from where I actually was . . . and they called back three times to verify that nothing was wrong. I listened to them more than the radio. Where do I find the fuse to kill that beast?",0
350,"I researched this vehicle before buying and found that all but one were great ratings. The one bad stated that he had electrical problems from the very beginning. Well, I am the second. After only 10 months, the alarm would trigger when ever I unlocked and opened the door. They replaced a circuit card. Then, the steering wheel would not tilt. They replaced the switch twice and then the steering column. Then it would not tilt nor telescope so they replaced a circuit card. Three weeks later, it's doing it again. The DVD volume is much louder than the radio and they can't fix it. The fan under the hood is very loud sometimes. I am getting lots of rattles and wind noise now.",0
351,"Our problems began after 4 months and less than 3000 miles when a p.s. hose burst on Jan 21/08. Dealer said it was probably water in the p.s. hose that froze and burst the line! No hoses available in N.A. so dealer finally stripped a new vehicle to get us going after a week. Second p.s. hose burst Feb. 13 causing smoke and fumes to enter our vehicle while driving! P.S. hose replaced again. Feb 21, 3rd hose ruptures, radiator is leaking antifreeze, transmission leaking oil and various electrical problems occurring. Still waiting on parts and without the use of our Vue for almost 2 months . Dealer does not know what is causing the problems. We are very very disappointed with this vehicle.",0
352,"I have owned this car since 1/1 and had nothing but problems with the front suspension. This car has very weak front springs especially the right side bottoms out with every bump in the road, inclined driveways forget about it. The front underside has taken a beating with such a weak suspension. Has been in the shop numerous times but to no avail(so far). Dealership has replaced front strut, aligned it and reposition a strut also to rid itself of a loud popping noise on the left front side. Will go back in the shop next week. Springs are so weak I can compress them with a single hand Fuel mileage I find above average, great dash and readouts, comfortable seats(do not spill on them).",0
353,"First vehicle I ever bought. Family has always owned Dodge with no problems. I have owned the vehicle for 7 mo and has been in the shop 7 times (mainly due to unreliable technicians). I have a squeek in the dash and passanger door that just wont go away. Recenly the bed of the pickup is offset from the passanger compartment. Also, after 2 hrs of driving the MDS doesn't know what to do (vehicle is constantly surging with the flucuating RPM's).",0

355,Ahhhh - right now what I can say. It gets bad gas mileage and I have only 6706 miles on it and already had it in service department 3 times with window switches and engine light comes on. There is no power.,0
356,"This is the worst vehicle I have ever owned. Passenger window rattles, brakes are poor, seat is hard and uncomfortable, radio sound quality is dismal. Also the paint is rough to the touch as though it has dirt embedded in it. The steering wheel does not return to the on center position without assistance. I read all the reviews before purchasing and cannot believe that they were mostly positive. Perhaps the higher models are more comfortable.",0

Absolute money pit.",0
358,I was disappointed in the ride. It sure didn't compare to my former Mercury Mountaineer. However the handling is very agile. Wish I had noticed how bland the car's exterior was in comparison to other suvs.,0
359,"The 650 has what BMW calls an ""inherent characteristic."" If you drive in ""manual"" shift mode the vehicle is prone to stuttering when coming to a stop. Imagine your head bobbing back and forth like a doll on the dashboard. The vehicle is also prone to severe lunges when driving in m1 (such as you might in a parking garage looking for a spot or while moving forward in a metered freeway on ramp) and to a lesser extent in automatic. The lunges are dangerous and you must drive defensively at 4 miles per hour. BMW states the problem is with the software-it thinks the engine is stalling and the computer gives the engine throttle. BMW won't fix the problem. Stay away from this vehicle.",0
360,"I now believe I made a mistake buying this vehicle. I thought it was going to be a great investment. Not so. The gas mileage is poor and there is this extremely annoying wind noise on the drivers side. based on other commentary, it would seem that it can not be fixed. Yeah, the vehicle does not look great but we bought it for the features and the price. We are very disappointed and are looking at our options of getting something else. It does not handle particularly well on the road. It has a tendency to float and I can almost see the gas gage move. Like one other guy said, I guess you get what you pay for.",0
361,"I've had this car for three months, 2100 miles so far. My concerns are the following: the engine revs when I step on the brakes (but not always). The brakes seem flimsy and just don't feel right. The paint job seems to be cheap. I'm noticing orange peel surface and there are spots, especially near the windshield, where the clear coat is worn off or never existed. I don't seem to get the gas mileage that I should be. I drive about 85% city and usually get about 31 mpg. I don't think I'll keep this car long and I worry about how it will look and run after 2 years. Don't get the chrome shifter knob. After three months it comes loose all the time and no longer lines up properly.",0

I think to myself, is this the day it is not going to start, every morning! It will be going to see a certified Chrysler dealer for the third time to fix this issue! wish me luck! On top of that, there is something wrong with the gas gauge and i ran out of gas on the highway because I got about 5 miles after the fuel light went on. One headache after the next with this Jeep Patriot and I had such high hopes. buyers beware!",0

367,"After a month of thorough research I narrowed it down to the Frontier and Tacoma. The Tacoma was roomier. It does have some spongy brakes that need to get used to (TRD 4x4). Interior is an A+! Good power and ride. Very comfortable seating. I have owned Chevys all my life. This is the first Toyota that I have purchased. Sold my 04 Colorado Z71 crew cab. This blows it away hands down. Even though I bought the fully loaded Colorado, it just feels cheap to drive when compared to the Tacoma. Great job Toyota! Some additional lighting for the 4x4 and various other switches would help. Also, I had to order a cabin filter. Toyota makes the slot for one but does not place one in there? C'mon.",0

369,"I just purchased a 2008 Rondo today. I think I made a mistake. The test drive took place in city traffic where I didn't see some of the flaws. On the long drive home there was a very annoying sound at the driver's window (air coming in). The car is very ""floaty"" & seems too wishy washy on the road. I don't feel in command of my vehicle. The 4 cylinder engine whines so loud, like it may explode before we really get rolling. I am thinking of taking it back in the morning & getting my money back. This is a cheap car & I don't feel safe in it.",0
370,"After 6 weeks of owning the car and 3,000 miles I noticed Paint chips on the side in front of the rear tires. I took it to the dealer and they took pictures and sent them to Mitsubishi and they said they wouldn't cover it that it was my fault. The front tires kick off stones causing a sandblasting to the side of the car. They said they didn't make mud flaps for them yet. It gets worse everyday. I see more people are having the same problem. I am now filling out paper work for the attorney General.",0
371,I've had my explorer for about a year now and i still hate it. first off i'm a mountain biker. When i tried to haul a trailer full of weight weenis CrossCountry mountain bikes the Explored bogged down. also there needs to be some fairly substantial mud flaps on this car. Very disapointing V8. No one can figure out where the inner door handles are and the outside look is about as plain as you can get. this car is unbelievably clumsy and lurpish in real 4 wheelin situations i don't trust it.,0
372,Thought I'd switch to an economy car - this car won based on price/gas economy alone. It hasn't been worth it - I'd rather spend extra money on gas to have a car with some torque. The resale value looks great - will be moving up to something sportier in the 200+ hp/torque range. Not a bad car but it is the first/last Honda I will ever own. Realized its too vanilla for me. Didn't like seeing commuters driving them everywhere. Kind of a bummer.,0
373,I am an avid Ford owner but am extremely disappointed to learn that at 54000 miles I am being told that yes they know there is a problem with the transmission (CVT) and they recognize the risk it poses to citizens but they are not willing to repair at their expense. I really don't want another car but cannot justify repairing this one.,0

We have now owned this car for almost a year and are barely getting 23 miles to the gallon, a far cry from our old toyota that ran perfect. So not only due we now have a car payment but a car that gets horrible gas mileage. We've tried several times to off load this to purchase a car that gets good gas mileage only to find out that a car we paid $14,000 for less than a year ago is only worth around 9 or 10 thousand dollars. I'm so sad that we no longer own our toyota. Cute car, fun to drive but don't buy it to save.",0

376,"I purchased this car and the next day at about 105 miles started a 450 mile trip. I was not expecting to get 19 MPG on hwy after reading on the Jeep website that you get 380 mile range per tank full. 210 miles into the trip on flat Southern Florida hwy, I had to stop for gas and every 210 to 230 miles thereafter for the rest of the trip and on the way back. Yes A/C was on but 19 mpg. I love the car, the interior and exterior designs but I am very disappointed with the gas mileage. The mileage was a major factor in the purchase decision and I feel that I was lied to.",0
377,"EPA 23 to 27? Was that measured while going straight down hill? Combined freeway and street driving is 19 mpg and that was with the cruise control while on the freeway. Hitting reset after tanking up then driving 10 miles in town displayed 15 MPG, about the same as my 4200 pound VW Vanagon and not even close to a 2001 C280 Mercedes 6 or a BMW 325 6 cyl, both German cars get from 25 to 34 mpg on the freeway. This reminds me, it did get 27 mpg on the freeway but that ended when the first hill was approached, then engine shifted and spun up to 5,000 rpm and the MPG display crashed to the low teens. Sorry Honda, but this is no gas miser, it guzzles!",0
378,Soon after I got this car something inside the door panel started to rattle. Had to go to 3 different dealer to finally get one willing to take the door panel off to fix. Squeaks/rattle all over the car when driving on rough surface. Roof when stored in trunk squeaks like mad. Window squeaks when rolled all the way up where it hits the roof. Dealer would apply some lube which works for about a week then rattle/squeaks returns and becomes worse. Get real people with 400hp the acceleration isn't much faster than a V6 Toyota Camry with 270hp. It probably is not worth to endure the noisy tire and all the poor interior.,0

Saw the 2008 in the dealership when in for first service in April, 08 Liked it because of enhanced features on most options. Thought I'd trade out and knew I'd get hammered on the trade. I didn't expect to get slaughtered. Dealer quoted me a trade value of $23,500, or 12,500 less than purchase price 3 months earlier, and was only willing to cut sticker price on 08 by $4,000.

380,"I recently purchased my Outlook in. I thought I was ahead of the game by purchasing an Outlook instead of the Toyota Sienna. My number one reason for purchasing the Outlook was the advertised fuel economy. I thought it was too good to be true and I was right. I have exactly 2,596 miles on the vehicle. I use the cruise control religously on the freeway with just myself in the vehicle going at the speed of 65mph and I can never get better than 20mpg. I also had the time to test the outlook driving in the city until I had to get gas with just myself in the vehicle at all times and the best mileage I got was 13 mpg. I am so unhappy.

""The Car You Can't Ignore"" ads were on every 5 minutes. The car was fun at first, but I swear it gets less responsive the more I drive it. Acceleration is reluctant, and steering is stiffer than when new. Just found out the steering gear is failing at only 16K miles. Rear seat doesn't latch properly, and if you stare at the sheet metal too hard, you can dent it with sheer will-power. (how did I get a door-ding on the roof?)

It is a spacious vehicle, but I would never recommend anyone buy this model. The ABS system is horrible. Don't even think about braking!

I complained a couple of times about the air smelling horrible when the A/C was on and they couldn't fix it (they couldn't smell it).

Cheap fabric on seat not sewn-just stuffed inside cheap plastic bucket of seat. Driver seat should be ergonomically correct-miserable drive.",0
413,The fuel economy of this truck leaves a lot to be desired. My truck is GPS'd so I am only able to drive the speed limit without getting in trouble. The best I have ever got for fuel economy is 14.8 mpg (imperial gallons). The quality of the truck is less than desirable. In cold weather (less than -20c) the back doors will not latch completely without slamming them hard. I actually knocked the molding off the door trying to get it latched. When the doors are closed they squeak and rattle so bad you have to turn the radio up. I have had to install a second battery to get the truck to start after sitting for more than 3 days. The airbag computer already stopped working and needed replacing.,0
414,After doing a lot of research we purchased our 2008 Sport Highlander just three weeks ago. After two weeks of driving it we started to hear a noise when we would accelerate the car. (Mind you it only has 750 miles on it). Long story short we took it in to be checked out and found out we need a new transmission!!!! We are not happy and now doubt the reliability of our car.,0
415,"The car is powerful, fast, has a great transmission and is normally fun to drive. However, I had a terrible problem with squeaks and rattles in the dashboard and other interior noises that took all the enjoyment out of driving it. Also, I am not a tall person, but the interior headroom is very limited, even with the seat fully lowered. It is very easy to bump your head getting into the car. My dealer could not fix the noise problem and reinstalled the dashboard so that it did not fit properly around the central instrument cluster. I got tired of hearing the noises everytime there was a bump in the road and after only five months and 6000 miles, I replaced it.",0
416,"I have had the car 15 months and in that time the fuel pressure regulator was replaced. At 14 months the car developed a rough idle and strong vibration that could not be repaired and I have been told this is ""within normal"" for this car. I have never had a rougher idling car in all the small cars I have owned.",0
417,"We moved out of the domestic market in the 1990's for better quality, e.g. Nissan, Lexus. We wanted an AWD SUV and deduced that the quality imports had gotten out of our reach. We were really taken by the Enclave when we tested one out, so we ordered one. To our disappointment we have found that the wheels & hubs build up with snow, ice or mud which sets up an uncomfortable vibration Which can only be alleviated by washing the wheels thoroughly with a pressure washer. The Dealer tells us that this is a common issue in all the newer vehicles due to the open hub. I am suspicious that this is a run around. I also drive a 2008 Explorer at work that exhibits no such problem.",0
418,I bought my 2007 Entourage in Spring of 2007. Automatic sliding doors have not worked properly since I bought it. Every time I bring it in for service I am told that nothing is wrong with the doors. Only other problem is the gas mileage averages about 17 MPG - not what I had expected. I want to get rid of it so bad - but the value has dropped so much - i can't get rid of it!!!,0
419,"I leased a 2008 GTS in Dec 07, only to get rid of it shortly thereafter. The right front door rattled terribly and the dealership kept pretending not to hear it. They also refused to print work orders for my car. The windshield wipers went out on me in the pouring down rain for about 5 minutes on the highway during rush hour. The subwoofer in the trunk became dismounted within the first week of me having the car. Ended up getting an 08 Nissan Altima Coupe. I love it. Better quality car and comes with better customer service.",0
420,"I purchased the Gl 450 4.7 Ltr about 1 year ago. It has spent over 2.5-3 months at the dealership while attempting to fix electronic problems. While driving the vehicle it would surge and then the warning lights would start lighting up like Christmas. The lights warned of the following failures ABS, Air bags to many to name they were all on. Then a big red box on the led would state drive to the dealership immediatly without shifting gears, how you do that in an automatic I'm still trying to figure out. We live in an isolated state with few roads and long distances between help. My faith in the Gl is gone! Hope no one else has experienced this. It still looks nice parked in my garage.",0
421,"Even after a few days there were problems with this SUV. Nothing really big but things detaching, safety belt not working (twice). This SUV is characterized by poor quality built and an overall blunt drive. The cargo space is quite big and the third row sat functional for kids. Burt for the price tag you should get better drive quality and certainly better build quality. The bluetooth function is very poor and does not synchronize with most phones. The dvd system does have some problems too. Poor fuel economy. Acura compares itself to BMW but they have a long, long way to go",0
422,"I have been wanting a Civic Si since before I can remember. Now that I have one, I wish I could return it. It feels like a Cadillac with 2 doors and a 4 cylinder engine. That is, it doesn't feel fast, the suspension is terrible, it never feels comfortable, and I just can't find a good seat position. The cabin feels claustrophobic and cramped and I am not a large person (5'5""). If I could return it, I would. I don't think I'll be keeping this car much longer and will take my losses. I'll give 6 months max. Completely disappointed. Depressed and dissatisfied. I'll probably never get myself to buy another Honda again.",0
423,"I thought this was my dream car. Traded in a 2001 Nissan Altima. (Miss it) I bought this car on Monday and it's been in the shop since Wednesday. Car broke down on my way to work, once I got it started again, engine light came on, took it to dealership and they couldn't duplicate problem. Broke down again the next day, on my way to work, car still in shop. They state it won't be fixed until Monday or Tuesday, have to install a a whole new assembly? Refuse to give me money back, no offer of another car to made good on bad Civic. First new car in 20 years and thought Honda was the best. The exterior is awesome, love the dash. Can't comment on mpg, haven't drove it or had it long enough to know",0
424,"We just leased an ES 350 coming out of a Acura TL. We have found the electronics, including radio and bluetooth to be inferior to the TL. Disappointing. Also some of the features like keyfob by driver (1 or 2) is not available on ES 350 as it is on TL. Very disappointing that satellite radio was not included nor did the dealers stock cars with the option. Had to have dealer add satellite radio at an exorbitant price. Acura TL has this standard. A car in this price range should have an excellent radio; excellent bluetooth; and include satellite radio. Could be the first and last Lexus.",0
425,"We ordered our van and it's been down hill every since. The van is beautiful inside and out, with many extras. Unfortunately we also have a van that engine brakes everytime we take our foot off of the gas. We brought it back 2 days after purchasing and 7 weeks later we are still getting the run around. This is my first new vehicle and I am terribly disappointed with this. The service manager and the district manager are making us wait further so that he can test drive the van. This problem is evident with just the feel of the vehicle and also is visible on the tach... the transmission is not releasing. Poor service!",0
426,"This is the very first brand new vehilce purchase I have ever made. I am quite disappointed. The exterior paint is ""cheap & sensitive"" (scratches down to the metal extremely easily, I have had to pay for protectant because of bird droppings marking it). The interior ""plastic"" (dash, doors)scratch extremely easily, and the upholstery snags like mad as well. The little windows on the front sides create blind spots. The window sticker when I bought it said avg mpg 30 highway and I have not ever gotten above 25-26mpg. Small gas tank. Cruise control is not standard neither are arm rests. Not terribly comfortable. Hard to handle in strong winds. Back seat not much leg room. Not ""family"" car",0
427,"I'm one of the unlucky few (or many) with the 5.7 engine trouble. I hope Toyota recalls this engine. I feel misled by Edmunds.com for raving about this truck almost guaranteeing reliability because it's a Toyota. Guess what. Toyota reliability is overated, now I know. I need to mention that this truck left me stranded out on the freeway. I had to wait 4 hours for a tow truck.",0
428,"My Kia Rio5 has been in the shop this past month 5 times for the same issue! Kia will only approve the minimal amount of repairs and has yet to fix my vehicle. For the last month, I have been without my car and after the engine and oxygen sensor has been replaced, the vehicle is still broken. What does Kia say??? Nothing. They will not return my phone calls. Whats the use of a 10 year/100,000 mile warranty, if Kia will not make good on it! Don't buy Kia! The cars are cute and fuel efficient, but not dependable and Kia does not stand behind their product!",0
429,"I have 15k on the car. AIR CONDITIONING IS HORRIBLE. I live in Colorado where we have had 20 days of 90+ heat. And when I drive the car home, the AC STOPS BLOWING COLD AIR whenever the car is stopped (w or w/o autostop). Honda manufacturing & my local dealer have confirmed ""THIS IS THE WAY THE CAR IS DESIGNED. In order to get the AC to blow cold air, the engine must be above a certain RPM."" Do you have any idea how uncomfortable it is to be sitting in the blazing sun at 5200 ft with no AC? It sucks. That's why I bought a car WITH AC. Turns out I must rev at the stoplights to have AC. Really disappointed with Honda. wish I had known this before buying.",0
430,"I've owned this car for 7 months now. This car pretty much seemed problem free up until when the weather gets really hot. Squeaks and rattles appear to come alive throughout the interior and pinpointing the area is difficult. Both sun visors came apart in the heat and failed to stay up. A/C condensation spills into the passenger interior instead of outside. Interior is very easy to scrape/scratch/scuff. Interior fabric and door panels will start to fade in the Summer sun. As for the driving aspect, clutch squeak, gear shifting hits a wall (all gears) and a/c belt squeak is becoming a common recurrence. Pedestrians will get lost in the large blind spots and the throttle response lags.",0
431,"My wife and i bought two SX-4 in december 2006. At first we did like the car but after a couple of month we thought that it was consuming more gas than the seller told us, but we dealt with it by slowing down our speed in order to stay beneath 9 liters/100km. We now have them for a little more than two and a half year and last week at 72K km, my wife's car alternator jammed and it wasn't covered by warranty anymore so we paid to changed the alternator. 10 days later, at 78K km my car's alternator jammed as well! We tought thas was abnormal so we called the dealership and he told us he couldnt do a thing. We then contacted suzuki canada and they told us the same thing. Don't buy that car!",0
432,"In the period of time I have had this car it has broken more times than the entire life of my 91 CRX. This car was purchased to be a daily driver as the CRX is modified and I was attempting to keep low miles on it. However, I've found myself having to drive the CRX more because this car breaks quite frequently. So far in the less than 12 month of owning it the fuel pump has been replace 2x, the starter has been replaced 1x and still won't turn over reliably, the tranny has been rebuild 1x, the a/c blower has been replaced 1x, the cd unit has been replaced 1x, and I'm sure I've forgotten a few. I will never buy a Nissan car ever again, and will trade in for a Fit soon.",0
433,"Our Q7 has been at the dealer for the past 45 days and they have no estimate as to when they will return it. This car has been a nightmare. Brakes started screeching at 2000 miles and in the 2.5 years that I have owned this car, it has been at the dealer over 20 times (excluding scheduled maintenance). The starter has been replaced twice which requires the entire engine to be pulled from the vehicle (nice design). Audi does have roadside assistance which is nice since I have had to utilize this service 6 times to have the vehicle towed to the dealer. The Q7 S-line is a cool looking SUV, if the cool design does not turn heads, the screeching brakes will!",0
434,"There is no joy driving my TL because upon acceleration at 2000 RPMs, it feels very rough like a grinding under the floor. After 2000 RPMs the rough feeling under the floor clears up. I have owned a lot of cars and our two other older vehicles (one of them is a truck and the other a small car) outperform this one. Other annoyances: when It rains and you open the trunk, water jumps the gasket and pours into the trunk space - debris too. There is excess noise when the moonroof is closed and the ceiling partition open when I'm on the freeway. I would like my 2005 TSX back. This is our fourth Acura and probably our last. I should not have to write a review like this.",0
435,"I bought my car brand new a year ago -- have loved it despite quirks with the windows (no fix for it yet...supposedly coming in late 2008). Drove it responsibly for 14,000 miles in the year to include a trip across country. Now the clutch is ""burnt"" and its not covered under the warranty. They are blaming me, which is ridiculous. I would be wary of buying one again.",0
436,"I have had this car for two weeks and I have put $130.00 in it driving just in town which is an average of 24 Miles per day. It evaporates the gas, took it in to Suzuki and they found nothing wrong. Saw another Lady at church and she asked me if my car drank allot of gas.I said yes,it does she said hers does as well. Same model and year 08 XL7. Needs to be built fuel economic. Uses to much gas.",0
437,I pull a 26foot trailer and when it comes to a hill you think your in a 4 cylinder. GMC should not sell this as a tow unit.,0
438,"I've had problems with the electrical systems (door locks, wipers, Navigation system,) and now worst of all the brakes. I went metal to metal on the rears after 33,000 miles. the calipers are failing to retract properly - thus Pads wearing out totally prematurely. Normally a car goes thru 3 sets of front pads to 1 set of rears. I've had my car serviced by dealerships only, thus far. When they rotate the tires, I ask them to check the brakes since the wheels are already off. Well At the time of last visit to the dealership, (22,363 miles) All was well-- now 11,000 miles later My right rear roter is shot on the inside only due to a defective caliper. What can I do about it????",0
439,16K miles in and it's my 4th trip to the dealership to the address the Fuel Economy issue. A hybrid that can't get more than 18 MPG in the city???!!! It's a Joke! Here is why... GM Hybrid technology is faulty. Ford got theirs from Toyota and the Escape gets 30 MPG (my neighbor has one) that's not a Joke. Maybe it's because it's a Mild Hybrid and GM never got to the full hybrid or plug in as expected.,0
440,"Based on several reviews I bought Odyssey without much thoughts. It is a good van for family. But, now I have 900 miles in the car with an awful 10-11 miles/gallon city + fwy. I saw some others also complains about low mileage of odyssey. while my friends 2008 odyssey gives 21 mpg city + fwy in my driving. I took it to the dealer and they asked to leave the car for 3 days for fuel test with out any compensation for replacement car. In general the odyssey makes lot of noise.",0
441,"I have owned my vehicle for about a year and a half. I have had it into the shop 6 times. I have had 2 recalls and several other issues. I have had the vehicle recalled for stalling (after I had already experienced the stall, which could have caused a serious accident), as well as I had a cracked roof rail, panels came loose over the seat belt on passenger side, air conditioner quit working today at 26,000 miles, the rear inside light will only come on if you hit it (Dodge says its a manufacturing problem) loose carpet, loose console covering, seat had to be removed to fix the carpet, and, the stain resistant seats do not resist anything.",0
442,"This car looks great from a distance but open the trunk and wham, primer everywhere, that paint should be like on the outside! Guess that's why the rust protection is what 4 years! Then they put those cheesy plastic plugs through the carpet on the trunk lid to affix it to the metal and put holes in the metal to do it - cheap. I open the hood and there is a long line of open unfinished jagged steel down the inside of each side of the hood. Talk about cheap! Everywhere I look I see corners like that cut.",0
443,"It makes loud brake noises, especially at low speeds. In addition, I hear the chip noises go on and off every time I accelerate the car. I don't think my next car is a Honda again.",0
444,"I had a check engine the 2nd. week of purchase; and they haven't quit. I am now waiting for a new and improved turbo, jacob brake,what ever you call it, burned up the first one. Old turbo had been cleaned and reassembled, reset light, and regenerated, to only come back on again! I wish that I had my 05 5.9 back! I was told to drive with turbo on always until the new one comes in. I am pissed off about all of the trips to dealer. I was suckered into buying the ""free"" 3000 mile oil changes. Not anymore! They can shove their oil changes! Some mech. wallowed my cooling fins flat and to top it off I was 2(two)quarts over the full line! I am investigating the Lemon laws in Oregon.",0
445,"This car was a big disappointment after driving it for a couple of weeks. The engine, build quality, fuel economy, and fun to drive factor were all there. However, the seating position and lack of a dead pedal left me feeling very uncomfortable. The gas pedal is too close to the driver, which resulted in constantly lifting one's foot off the accelerator in order to properly control the throttle. Move the seat back too far and you can't reach the clutch and steering wheel. Also the lack of a dead pedal (or even a flat spot), leaves one's foot on a round bump. This was such a shame because the car really zips around and is fun to drive.The new FIT is out this fall & I advise to wait.",0
446,"Bought this car new. Driven mostly highway miles to/from work. Bluetooth module didn't work when I bought it. Fit & finish items at 5k, same issues now but it's no longer under warranty. Interior rattles out the wazoo. New Engine 24K. Tires 30K. New Transmission 59K. Replaced CV boots 59K. Days in shop since I've owned it, 68. Still making the vibrations in the drivetrain & ""they can't figure it out"". Only 500 miles left on the warranty. Bet they'll figure it out as soon as I have to pay for it. Best mpg 30, worst mpg 22, average mpg 26. Owned Nissans before but NEVER AGAIN!!",0
447,My Silverado 1500 Classic has already had to have the rotors and drums turned! What has happened to Chevy's quality? It took the dealership-2 tries to even figure out what was going on. In town driving only--it has the tow pkg--which I don't use. The mpg is horrible. Have been a Chevy family for a long time but no more.,0
448,"After turning in a 2004 Caddy this car is lots of fun. Very surprised so far. Gas mileage in town is not good! Highway was much better. Only problem, rear of XR should have rear seat armrest and also a AC duct for rear A/C to get to! Minor additions but great value to rear passengers. Sound system is great! Only interior part that looks cheap is the interior door panels, other than that great car for the money. Can't compare that to anything out there.",1
449,"Did my research on Edmunds customer reviews and the Passat had consistent stellar reviews. Considered Honda, Subaru, Volvo but kept going back to the Passat. Wanted something sporty, family friendly, and decent gas mileage and Passat won me over. The Passat is quick and a blast to drive! We have a SUV for family trips and a luxury Japanese sedan but we seem to always take out the VW! A little expensive than other brands but a little negotiating can put you at the same price range for a better car.",1
450,I have wanted a truck for some time and choose this vehicle over the F-150. My experience so far with this vehicle has confirmed I made the right choice. I particularly like the fact that it does ride very smooth. I don't like the fact that the air conditioner automatically switches back to outside air. I haven't figured that out yet.,1
451,"I'll start this by saying I'm an auto dealer and have owned many different trucks. I have an 08 F150 XLT with the FX2 front end. It has the 5.4 V8 which is a great workhorse for longevity and strength. It tows my 10,400 ib. trailer like its not behind me. The only aftermarket performance parts are a Volant cold air intake and Flowmaster exhaust. I get between 16- 17mpg in town and 21 on the highway with cruise. My business partner has an 05 F150 FX4 with 201,000 miles on his 5.4. First engine and transmission. They are definitely built Ford tough. Just run synthetic fluids and keep out of the throttle. By far the strongest, most comfortable, most practical truck out there.",1
452,"I have been driving my Prius for 2 months and it is by far the best car (out of 8 that I have owned) I have owned. I'm averaging 47.5 mpg - 75% highway, 25% city - I was expecting low 40s so I am thrilled. I have been impressed with the pickup and interior room.",1
453,"Wish I had the V6. However, I got a great performing 162hp 4 cyl. w/ excellent MPG and price paid was below invoice. Cost savings offset my preference of V6. I must be a performance oriented driver. 2nd wish: Stiffer suspension. I'm not looking for stiff suspension. I would prefer variable rate resistance that increases when the springs and shocks reach compression. It would improve cornering on rounded on-ramps. Interior noise levels could be quieter. Depending on road surface, noisier than expected on anything but smooth surface roadways. Still, satisfactory. Overall, a GREAT car. The foregoing are acceptible consequences of car's budget orientation. Terrific car!Happy overall.",1
454,"After driving a mini-van for quite awhile, I was so excited about driving a truck again! In shopping around, we narrowed our choices down to the Yukon, Tahoe, and Armada. Fortunely, we fell upon a rebate that we just couldn't resist on the Yukon! I Love it! It has worked out very well for my children as well. There is plenty of elbow room for them. The rear A/C has been a lifesaver in our Texas heat! It runs smoothly, looks great, and gives us a secure feeling that we are well protected. The gas mileage could be better but we knew that when we bought it. The stereo is great and the instrument panel is well designed. OnStar, XM radio, and remote controls are wonderful. I highly recommend it!",1
455,"5,000 miles in approx. 1 month. 6 cylinder, auto, no frills, manual windows, vinyl floors, seats. Roomy, added Work Rack and boxes. Felt engine lacked power, downshifted too often on inclines. Added K&N air filter. Big improvement. Better mileage, too. Good truck. Comfortable.",1
456,"I've always had small American cars. I was tired of throwing money away after 60K. Everyone I know that has a Toyota, loves it. I thought it was about time I owned one. I love my mother's Rav4 but it was too pricy for my budget. My Yaris has every single upgrade except a spoiler & is still a better deal than a basic Corolla.",1
457,Very nice car. I had a E55 prior to this car and it was also very nice. I did like the twin turbo in my e55 but I like the seven speed transmission quite a bit better than my old car. Plenty of power but gas mileage is terrible. All in all a great car.,1
458,"In its price range, the Si stands out. Stock, it's on par with the GTI, Cobalt, supercharged tC, and RSX Type-S. Yet the GTI and supercharged tC are limited as tuner cars and are more expensive for the setup and don't handle as well. The Si even compensates for low toque with its high rev short throw setup. It's interiors and Honda's build quality beat out the Cobalt and RSX (how it beats the ""higher class"" version of the same company is a mystery to me), and the GTI's exterior is a matter of personal taste. Whether its stock or tuned, the Si packs a punch behind the wheel and outdoes its competitors. It even has bonuses like a 300w audio system, moon roof, and a sleek racy design.",1
459,I really enjoys driving it. It feel like a Sport and Work Truck all in one.,1
460,"I recently traded in my 2004 Ford F150 for a 2008 Fusion 4cyl SE. I dont miss the V8 like I though I would, but i love my current fuel economy. The 4cyl engine has a lot of power considering the size. Great overall comfort too. Almost got leather, but didnt really need it. Handles great in traffic and on the curves.",1
461,"I've had the wagon for about six months now and it's a good car. I haven't had any problems to speak of. The seats are firm, but not the most comfortable, I could drag a house down the street with this thing, but won't any races, and my mileage is excellent (avg. 21mpg hwy/cty), all typical of a diesel. That said, everything electric about it is inferior to the domestic wagons. The power lift- gate is slow and doesn't always close, the nav. is a pain to use and slow in responding, the rain sensing wipers typically do what they want, even on a sunny day, and the front parking ""see dead people"" and want to warn me about it. If you're thinking about a 4wd wagon, check out the Flex, cool & cheap.",1
462,"Could not have chosen anything better at this point. Feels safe, drives beautifully, and looks like a Lexus GS. This is a great car!",1
463,"It took a while for us to drive a bunch of the SUVs closely resembling the Highlander. Before test driving several vehicles I had already sold myself on an Acadia. After the test drive the obvious winners were the 2009 Pilot and Toyota Highlander. We had looked at the Highlander a couple of years back but it was smaller and the dash was just plain ugly. The new redesign and the plush drive just did us both in. The Pilot would have offered a little more room but the dash looks like its made out of cheap plastic, and unless you get the all black interior the two tone effect was not very appealing to us. We have a family of 4 so we can leave the third row down and use when needed.",1
464,"I evaluated the Tribute after 400 miles earlier here. I have dutifully, every fill up, recorded fuel consumption for over 5000 miles now. The mileage is incredible and I have only done a few minor things to it --put in a K&N filter (at 4000 mi) and Mobil 1 at 3000 mi. Here are the stats: overall avg. mpg 28.5. High: 33.11 mpg, low 25.5 mpg. On last tank full, averaged 32.6 (90% highway). If I drive between 60 & 65 and get it into 5th at 30 mph, I can get 32+. Between 65 & 70, I can get 30-32 mpg. Driven between 70 & 75, 28-30 mpg is possible. Above 75, it tails off as you would expect. This has got to be the most economical small SUV with a stick shift. Very pleased with it.",1
465,We sold out Mitsubishi Evolution in an effort to decrease our car payment and decrease our gas consumption. The civic seemed like the obvious winner in our minds. We wanted a bigger vehicle (Accord or Acura TL) but their real world gas mileage isn't that great. We settled with the smaller civic and are very happy. The leather is great and I'm sure the heated seats will be nice this winter. We started around 32-33 MPG and the last 2 tanks have been 35+. We drive 85% highway @ 80 MPH. The engine power isn't bad considering we live +7k feet elevation. It should be more than adequate everywhere else in the country. Maybe not as quick as the competitors (mazda3) but a great car!,1
466,"This was the first vehicle I test drove when I started car shopping - after no less than 10 vehicles later I returned to buy this awesome car! A practical indulgence - a hardtop sedan when the weather is bad and a convertible when the sun is out. Mine is all but totally loaded with the exception of a navigation system & ultra-prem leather which seems nearly impossible to find - I couldn't be more thrilled. With 2 hours in daily commute time, the ride is luxurious and fun to the point I don't want to leave the vehicle. All I can say is that if you see one on a Volvo lot snap it up ASAP - you won't regret it! Safety, style and fun all rolled up into one great vehicle.",1
467,"Another great car! The 2008 may be the last in this series, so I had to buy before they change it into a cross-over! I drive a lot of interstate miles, and feel safe with higher assurance of returning if hit. Sort of a small tank. No fear of muddy country roads with the great 4wd. Did have to give up a power plug for the MP3 plug-in (bummer)!The 08 has added XM radio and does offer some good entertainment while on trips. Almost same as 05, slight loss of build quality. Noticeable looseness in rear torque conversion around 35 mph or so, not in 05. Maybe it will go away with time. Still could not get side airbag option, must be a myth, like GPS. Not an economy car. Feels secure on the road.",1
468,"Just had the vehicle over a week, and now I enjoy driving to work, its a wonderful commute car, comfortable, quiet, smooth ride, excellent brakes, enough power to go effortlessly in and out of traffic, the vehicle is responsive and feels tight (well built), it takes road bumps and potholes such that the driver is always in control of the steering, so far I've gotten just under 30mpg using premium gas, about 24 using mid range gas. Was ready to buy RAV4 but after taking test drive and seeing the quality and all the standard equipment there was no question honda is a better deal. Not sure how much better V6 would be, this engine has plenty of power for the average driver...",1
469,"I was only window shopping, but fell in love with this car. I never thought I would own a small car again. It's silver with a sunroof, and as everyone says....it's fun to drive. It has every feature I was looking for. I did not shop around for other small cars. This was the one I HAD to have.",1
470,"This is my 4th Lexus and my first LS and it won't be my last. This is a true work of art and a brilliant machine. The car rockets from zero to 60, opens up and is cruise-like at 70 MPH plus. The ride is so quiet and serene it is easy to forget you are actually in a car even at high speeds. The LS is unbelievably quiet even at all speeds & in the city. Even driving at 50 MPH with the sun roof open is quieter than most vehicle with a closed sunroof. The interior is impeccable and is likely nicer than many living rooms you will encounter. The car surrounds you in luxury at every turn from the plush heated/vented seats and roomy feel to the easy to reach controls and tech features. Overall a gem.",1
471,"I am very particular about cars and this Civic exceeds my expectations. I opted for the EX L with a manual transmission and absolutely love it. Interior is very nice especially compared to the other cars I've owned and the ones I test drove before purchasing this one. Stereo has a nice sound, seats are super comfortable-love the wrap around feature. Easy for me to get in and out of the car. Like the button that remotely pops trunk. Manual transmission is smooth. Steering is nice and easy. Handles corners well. Fold down rear seats are great. For the price, this is an excellent car and value. If you want BMW features then you will have to pay a BMW price.",1
472,"Great car! I am a very frugal (okay, cheap) shopper who goes over everything with a fine tooth comb. This car is great. I owned a Geo Metro for 5 years and considered an Aveo. The Yaris is the best of the three with the most power performance, the most room, and the best at making me smile when I drive. IF I get rid of it before I retire, I'll looking to get another!",1
473,I chose this car because dealers were gouging on the Prius. I have been very pleasantly surprised. My mileage has been 48 highway and 43 city-- better than expected. Road noise and stereo have not been issues and both are superior when compared to my 2005 Escape Hybrid -- and the Civic is a lot more fun to drive. I highly recommend this vehicle.,1
474,"I traded in two vehicles before buying my Speed6, a Dodge Ram 1500 and a Ford Focus ZX4 sedan. This car blows them both out of the water by a mile in terms of quality and character. I cross-shopped a few different cars, mainly the Mazdaspeed 3, Volkswagen GTI Fahrenheit, Volkswagen R32, Subaru Legacy GT. I've driven 1000 miles already in 2 weeks, and I absolutely love this car. I find excuses to run errands, and it makes my daily 90 mile commute something to look forward to. Best vehicle I've ever owned, and this is my 7th car.",1
475,"This is my first ever never used car. The fuel economy is spot on estimate during the summer months. Under estimate in winter (bear in mind fuel mixtures are different in winter). I do mostly 55mph+ driving, with city errands and cruising on the weekends. First and second gear have good power for its size. I'm always tearing up my tires. A lighter flywheel would make the shifting more responsive. After driving a series of beaters that lacked, power, heat, AC, floorboards and door windows that functioned, this little car is like a dream. Super quiet! I often have people ask me if it's on. Spacious. Handles wind shear well... ever driven a tiny Ford Festiva in the wind? HUGE difference!",1
476,"I transitioned from a basic, bare-bones Toyota Echo to the 2008 Honda Fit--what a difference. MPG is less than I was used to, but this is much more of a car and well worth the slight decrease in mileage. This car is fun and solid to drive; pickup is great, especially for a car with such little horsepower, and the car is very comfortable on long road trips. The sport model is worth the higher price, since those little luxuries all factor into the enjoyment of driving this car.",1
477,"This Expy makes our 3rd. A gold XLT witht he 4.6 V-8, an black XLT with the bigger V* and this white 08 XLT. The progression and evolution of these vehicles is remarkable. The 08 is a s good as anything from any other manufacturer, including GMC, Chevy, Toyota, Nissan and Honda...and in fact better than them in many ways. The quality is great, features for the price remarkable, ride and handling not at all what we expected, very smooth, quiet and controlled. The V8, as typical for the Expedition, does not feel as peppy as the sound and horsepower would indicate, but it's a trailer pulling mule! Big and barn like inside, comfortable seats, leg room and head room great. Love it!",1
478,"I've been a fan of the Corvette as long as I remember, but this is my first one. Comparing it to anything else I've ever driven... well, I just can't. It outperforms them all in just about every way. Obviously, it is a sportscar and no one can deny it's performance (even not considering it's price). I shopped several european vehicles and looked at a couple of Asian models. The only thing close of US manufacturer's are the Viper (not civil enough for me) and the Cadillac, which is a heavier underpowered Corvette. Nothing compared. Acceleration is incredible, handling sublime, but what I'm most impressed with is the comfort. I'm 6'3"" and feel comfortable enough to enjoy a 10 hr trip",1
479,"Our family has had this vehicle for two weeks and it is spectacular. My wife is the primary driver and she loves it. I've gotta think that some Americans (Chrysler influence?) were involved in the design parameters because the Germans finally nailed what an SUV should be. This chameleon is amazingly user friendly and provides everything you could want in a large SUV but somehow feels diminutive from behind the wheel. The interior is truly something to behold. Stitched leather, gorgeous wood accents, and appealing angles abound. A++",1
480,"This is my first Honda. I have had the car for 4 weeks and I am very impressed with the quality that Honda delivers at this price point. The car is quick and nimble with the 5-Speed manual transmission. Also lots of fun to drive. I bought this car for the excellent gas millage and I am getting around 33 MPG in combination of highway (with traffic) and around town. This car has lots of room. I am 6' 2"" and there is plenty of headroom and ample legroom. No complaints from the back seat either. The Honda engineers really maximize the interior space for such a small car. The seats fold in many different configuations to accomadate various cargo.",1
481,"Granted, I have owned this car for less than a week, but after a decently long trip for the holidays I feel I can give some helpful insight. For me the performance has been very acceptable. For a 1.5 liter engine it is peppy, quiet and smooth. The layout of the interior is not that quirky, but I do admit I like the sedan's interior better than the hatchback I tested - seems to be higher quality. The sound system is excellent and this is with the standard single CD AM/FM stereo. I got 40 mpg on my trip and think my opinion of this car will only get better with the miles.",1
482,"Got the car last week. I love it, it is so much fun to drive. I also love that you don't see many on the street so you find people looking at your car wondering what it is. It has the perfect balance of a sports car and yet keeps the sophisticated feel of a Volvo. Much better buy than other cars in its class such as the volvo GTI, Civic SI, Mazda Speed 3, or Mini Cooper S. Test drove the rest and thought this one was the best choice.",1
483,"I traded in my 06 Tacoma Prerunner Double Cab Long Bed TRD Sport for an SR5 Crewmax Short bed with 5.7 6 AT. The Crewmax takes regular gas at 87 octane compared to the 92 octane that the Tacoma required. The Tundra accelerates with ease, and the ride is very smooth. I love the rear seat space. It is huge back there, and my family can relax during long drives from Vegas to Orange County. So far, the Tundra is a winner. I just hope that my 5.7 is not one of those with a defective camshaft that grounded about 20 5.7s so far.",1
484,"For all who have the SRT8 or buy something similar, Performance & Styling must be the first thing on your mind. It can't be, or shouldn't be, gas mileage, comfort, or even reliability. Sports cars, or in this case, Muscle Cars, are a breed all to themselves. They can't be huddled with the rest of the pack. They are specialty built and because of that, stand alone. This Charger SRT8 is what Dodge set it out to be. Cool looking, fast, fun and exhilarating to drive?not to mention an attention getter. It hits the mark in those areas 100% The sound of the V8 is balanced and perfect. I can?t say enough good things about it. Buy this car if you?re in the market.",1
485,"Had a Sequoia before the 2007 RX 350 AWD and I loved it. I sometimes miss the capacity of the Sequoia, but the RX 350 is such a great car, I'm over it in no time! This car is so generously appointed and capable, I seriously sometimes forget I have to drive it... it does everything else for me. I got everything on it except the DVD system and I'm still learning cool stuff it does. I test drove many cars before deciding on this one and for the money, there is nothing better out there. Actually, nothing even came close.",1
486,"For just under 40k I got a 4matic with several of the other bells and whistles including Nav, heated seats, metalic paint, HK radio system with Bluetooth etc. etc. It performs exceptionally well. Pick up is great and excellent in the snow. I am in love with this car.",1
487,"I had a Town & Country and traded it in, it did not compare with the Sienna. I can't tell you how happy I am with the Sienna. The Sienna is nothing but class and a good looking car. I wish I had gotten it sooner.",1
488,"I wanted an suv that had plenty of room and was safe for my toddler son. After test driving my Armada I knew it was perfect. It is much more accessible than a Tahoe or Yukon. I read many reviews on here to see what everyone else had to say about the Armada and realized that gas was the biggest concern. Safety was my biggest issue so we went ahead and purchased it and are happy that it gets 17 miles to the gallon in the city. It is as big as a house, we have room for days, and the gas mileage is not much worse than a midsize. I am glad I chose an Armada.",1
489,Love my Honda Civic EX coupe 5 speed. This is the best Civic ever built. It beats all the competition. Honda legendary reliability. Gas mileage. I have been averaging about 35 mi/gal. Awesome. Fantastic styling. Best color is black. I love everything.,1
490,This is my first SUV and I have test driven plenty of them. The design of this vehicle is awesome. Although the mileage is not that great it does very well on the highway. If you haven't purchased one yet get out and get one.,1
491,"Wow am I surprised. The interior of this car is more beautiful than anything I have seen or driven, including the various Acura's, BMW's, and MB's I've had and my friend's Cayenne. The power is smooth and the fit and finish are excellent. The only thing a bimmer or Audi has that this lacks is the suede/leather on the doors..this car has plastic. So what? The saddle leather is unbelievable. The price was amazing, too, with recent incentives (MSRP $46K with option, $33K out the door!)",1
492,"I love my new Focus. The ride is smooth and the leather smells heavenly every morning. After leaving a mid-size SUV I was afraid of missing the power and room but the Focus has ample power and tons of front leg room for me to reach out with my long legs. The trunk is very large and holds more than enough shopping and luggage for most. The back seat is small and would be good for small children. I am usually the only one in the car but the kids fit just fine when we get out together. I am thrilled with the 5 options for music. USB,MPG or I-pod, radio, 6 CD changer, and the best, Sirius. The car looks better tinted and I recommend purchasing aftermarket door edge gaurds. Happy trails!",1
493,I used to buy Nissans and Hondas for all these years. I am very happy with the decision that I made to buy a Cadillac CTS. It is just excellent.,1
494,"I gave up my Pontiac Montana with some hesitation. But the purchase of this car was a wonderful choice. It rides well, it is comfortable and sporty looking. I am a plus size woman and the comfort for me is wonderful. The only thing is I continue to get confused with the window controls not being on the doors. Otherwise a great car for the money.",1
495,Had a Regal before this. I like this car a lot better although the Regal got a little better gas mileage. Other than this no complaints,1
496,"What a great little car, I have driven a hyundai accent hatchback since 2002 and this is soo much nicer, it is more comfortable, the mileage is better, it looks a whole lot cooler, the only thing that this doesn't have is all of the standard features, but overall I have no complaints.",1
497,"I have had this vehicle a few weeks and so far I am very happy with what I got for the money spent. The items that are noted as cons in the Edmunds review do hold true, but are not that big of deal in looking at the vehicle overall. I think the Escape handles well for an SUV and I enjoy driving it. The interior is nice and the cab is fairly quiet except when the engine is excellerating. I have only filled the tank on this vehicle 3 times so far. The first time I got 26mpg and the last two times I got 30mpg. This is a combo of freeway and city driving. I even drove it up the steep hills of San Francisco with three adults in it and still got 30mpg with good power.",1
498,"I was looking for a car and happened to find the si. I have driven the older models and loved them, when I first got in the drivers seat of this car I felt like I was in a Jet ready to take off. I love the feel of the car. It sounds great, has great turning and can get up and go. You get a lot of looks in this car. This car is pretty fast if you need it to. The 8200 redline is a feature I really enjoy. When in 2nd gear and you hit the 6000 rpm the Vtec kicks in, and puts you into your seat. I cant help myself but smile every time. This Si is truly one awesome care and a GREAT purchase. I love the in car features as well. makes driving fun and comfortable.",1
499,"Was considering several cars like Mercedes C350, E350, Lexus GS350, Infiniti G35, BMW 528i sport. After driving all of them, the 535i with sport, premium, navi, xenon blew them all away. Great transmission with 2 sport modes and paddle shifters. Car is glued to the road. Active suspension almost eliminates body roll. IDrive is functional just takes some time to learn all the menus. Picks up speed instantly, no turbo lag. Very fun to drive. My 1st BMW and now I know why its called ultimate driving machine. Other premium brands don't come close in road feeling.",1
500,"I bought my Kia by trading in my Nissan Armada. I was commuting on weekends from my home in Dallas to my parents in Jacksonville, Tx. I went from $65 in gas to $40 and also about 4 more days before I had to fill up. My son has plenty of room in the backseat in his carseat with his books, crayons, and DVDs. The Armada was so high, I always had to open the door for him. Now, he gets on in. I do contract work for a florist and the easels fit nicely. I make arrangements in my home and I have plenty of room to put everything. The engine is very quiet, it handles great in the rain. I love my Sorento!",1
501,"I've driven cross country twice, it's my daily driver, trail rig, and family mover. My Jeep has done everything I've asked of it without a single maintenance issue to date. I've ridden trails from IL, OK, TX, NM, AZ, CO & UT, and the QDII system is hands down the best 4WD system available on the market. Front, rear, center ELSD's provide a sure-footedness I never experienced in my other 4X4's. The luxury is top shelf. Every gizmo I could want, MyGig, HID's, 4 seat warmers, nav system. All work together to provide an incredible driving experience. And it always looks sharp, aggressive, and ready to go.",1
502,"Love the car and the way it handles in city and highway driving. It's fun and economical. The transmission takes a couple of drives to get use to how it shifts and the feel of the pedal, but once you drive it a little, it responds just fine.",1
503,"The 2007 Passat Wagon replaced my V8 Touareg. The wagon offers more space and utility than my Touareg did, while providing a much better driving experience. I'm averaging 29 mpg combined and about 34 mph hwy...roughly double what I got in the Touareg. This also turns heads more than the Touareg did new. Any stigma my wife thought she'd feel with a wagon is absolutely gone. She loves the style and realizes it's a smarter purchase than another SUV would've been. This is an Audi / Mercedes / BMW quality vehicle at a Chevy price.",1
504,"The 08 Grand Cherokee Laredo equipeed with the 26X package has a nice ride and an exceptionally high build quality. No squeeks, no rattles and the fit of parts is virtually perfect. Gas mileage around town has been 15.2 mpg.",1
505,"Fun to drive. Front end not very smooth. It feels like it's missing rubber bushings in the front. I hope it is an actual Mercedes and not just a name change from Dodge Durango to Mercedes GL450. It will be very disappointing if that's the case. Otherwise, it is a good vehicle. Also, it's difficult to lift the middle row to get the 3rd row.",1
506,"I've been researching replacement vehilces for my '01 Ford Escape for ~1- year, on-off. When the Saturn Vue came out a few months back I took a first test-drive in an XE 3.5 AWD. It felt good and was adquately powered, but wanted to test-drive the XR, but didn't get a chance to. Waited until the Red Line's started showing-up and decided this was the one for me. Put down a little more to reduce the monthly- payment. Mine's Polar White, with the Ebony interior. Looks good, feels good to sit-in, and best of all it's a hoot to drive so far. The 6-speed transmission is silky-smooth, with a quiet V6 engine, and just enough rumble coming from the chromed tail-pipe tips, sounds great too.",1
507,"Ok, I just got the little beast yesterday. I had a ball on the test drive and then had even more fun on my 48 mile commute. This transmission is smooth as glass and my roommate loved the exhaust tone when I rolled up to get something from him. I'm considering actually teaching my girlfriend to drive stick with this car. The easy clutch and short throw of the shifter will make her life easier.",1
508,"I am very happy with this Arcadia. It has a great ride, nice looks and is fun to drive. It gets decent gas mileage for its size. The interior seem to be of high quality. I have had it for two weeks and every day I like it more and more .",1
509,"This is the 3rd Hyundai I have owned since 1999. The first 2 were great cars. I got the GLS 4 cylinder with the 5 speed manual trans. Even though this is the cheapest model it still comes with all the safety features as standard. The car drives great, quiet and smooth. Very comfortable and roomy. I am getting 32 MPG with this car, I guess the 5 speed helps here. I averaged 35 MPG with my much smaller Elantra. This is excellent economy for such a large car. Pretty quick for a four cylinder too. I love the stereo, burned a CD with 125 MP3's and the stereo played them perfectly. Just a great value in a mid size car.",1
510,"I just got my new Yaris today and I love it. It is taking me some time to get used to driving a new car, but it handles great. It excels much better than my old car, and very quickly for a 4 cylinder. I got the 4 door sedan. I didn't get any special features, just a radio/cd player, but it is better equipped than my old car. At this pricepoint, the payments are affordable on my part time college student income. I just can't say enough about my car.",1
511,"Love this car, fast learning curve, very easy to park with back up video, plenty of spaces for things, 2 glove compartments, remote compartment, glasses compartment, 4 cup holders, external audio in to radio for cassette tape player or mp3 - love it, love it, love it!",1
512,I just got the car and love driving it. The best smooth drive (Civic & Vesra horrible to me) and nice handling. My only negative is you cannot shoot into traffic with it. Nice standard and satellite radio with MP3 hook up. Bought for my teenager but I enjoy driving it. Great price for the money. I could not beat it. Not sure of the gas mileage yet.. Keep posted.,1
513,"Traded in a 2002 Tundra that I never had a problem with. The 2007 has all the little things that I wished for on my 2002. Ride is great but stiffer than the older one, which I like, but I do have the off road suspension which makes it slightly stiffer. Get all kinds of looks and thumbs up on the road. Interior comfortable and easy to operate controls. It is definitely full size and the 5.7 is sooooo much fun to drive even when you are not towing.",1
514,"I drive 60 miles to work. My chevy truck gets 15 mpg. Gas prices drove me to the small car and Edmunds reviews by others made my choice for the Yaris. First fillup 38.1 mpg, next fillup 37.9 mpg next was 40.7 mpg. I drive 60 miles work 5 lights hwy driving. I am 6ft 3in plenty headroom sedan 4 door. Fun to drive, plenty trunk room automatic shifts great.",1
515,"The car is very fast (6.0 is great), handles great, and is very hard to find. Dealer looked for weeks before we found a GT that would do. It still was not the color we wanted (we got red wanted gray, but car does turn heads) nor did it have the performance package, but it does have the sunroof and leather. Great seats, great steering, really really fast. Dealer only discounted $500 off the sticker, but still good value for so much car.",1
516,"I love this vehicle! Was a bit hesitant as I moved from a Mercedes E500 and thought I'd miss the HP & luxury but the Volvo has far exceeded expectations. I drive through Colorado about 50K/year and with Blizzak tires, the Volvo is extremely dependable & secure. I will drive 600 miles in one day and finish refreshed & happy. Averaging 24 MPG on non-premium gas. Certainly not a race car - but you should know that going in. Two thumbs up. Only complaint, the key stinks.",1
517,"This is the best vehicle I have driven. It is a smooth ride. I have a big family and there is enought room for all my four children. The interior is very stylish, I especially like the white stitching on the black leather interior. It is very comfortable.",1
518,"Before buying my civic (Jun 6,08) I drove the Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla. The Corolla was a good and I would have bought one but having two other Hondas (97 Odyssey & 97 Civic, both still going strong) it was hard to leave a good thing. My compromise was I couldn't get stability control but buying it with the Corolla would have meant having other options I didn't want. I went with the LX over the EX because I didn't want the sunroof or 5-spoke alloy wheels (just didn't like the look). However, Honda has a 15', 7-spoke wheel that is nice. I bought them and a trunk liner from College Hills Honda (on-line) for about one-half the cost my local dealer wanted.",1
519,"This is a fun SUV (wagon). It's a real eye catcher, and you'll find yourself just looking at it or in it. It's just different. So far good on gas, better then my old Dodge 2500, at about 8 mpg. Just love this ride.",1
520,Traded in 2007 Mazda for this Hyundai. Best move ever. the Sonata is probably the best vehicle Ive owned yet and I trade every year. Sonata is well made quiet and smoother than the other cars I tested prior to buying. This car will probably end my yearly trades. Its a keeper.,1
521,"Great mileage, easy handling, dash components within easy reach, tire pressure monitors a pain on real cold days - likely with any car with TPM systems. Why they left out an MP3 connector is beyond comprehension - otherwise a perfect car. Good height, visibility, what you want in a larger vehicle but with the great fuel economy .",1
522,"We purchased this car for my wife in May of 2008. A life long Honda/Toyota owner, she pursued test driving those makes. Accords, Civics, Corollas, Nissans, she test drove them all, often several times. She came away unsatisfied with all of them for one reason or another (style, driving experience, interior quality.) Then, on the way to test drive yet another Accord (YAWN) she saw an Aura on the road and that was that. The car's beauty, performance, engineering, and price were absolutely second to none. Perfect car. People offer positive comments about the car often...",1
523,"I purchased the xD in March 2008, and have six months experience driving it. Fuel economy has been a steady 34 mpg, calculated. I have had only one incident where the Vehicle Stabilization Control system automatically worked its magic. It was during a highway run, climbing a hill during a rainstorm when traction was especially bad. The system kicked in at a time when I was unaware that I was losing traction. I maintained control with its aid, slowed down,and carried on with my trip all smoothly, safely done. This VSC is a worthwhile feature. One slight but nagging shortfall in the design of this car is the FEEL of the brakes-- they operate well, but are vague in their feel.",1
524,"If you get a CLK550 Cabriolet, the sport suspension option is a must have. Had mine trucked down to N. Cal. from Wash. State, since it was only one in Western USA with sport suspension (for me), run flats (for wife), backseat side airbags (for son), and P3 option (best front seats). It has every opt. except power trunk closer. This is the best Mercedes I've every owned, and been loyal customer since bought 380 SL in 1982! Solid build, no problems, performs better than last year's AMG model for $20K less, quiet with the top up. 0-60 mph on mine is much faster than 5.1 sec. spec. It can go 65+ on 25mph curved exit w/o ESC. Wish I could take it to Germany and drive it on the Autobahn!",1
525,"I traded in an older loaded Jeep Grand Cherokee for this & thought I'd miss the space but haven't had the first regret. I got mine loaded so the gadget factor is really fun! I didn't know how bluetooth worked so having it shut off my music for an incoming call is great-no more missed calls(and mic picks up my tot's voice in back great)! I love not having to deal with keys at all since I have a toddler. Love the Bose sound system but above all, love the ride! The drive is very smooth with CVT, once you're at speed it's SUPER quiet.. turn on jazz or classical for a great experience. It hugs the road too - didn't realize how bouncy the truck frame on my Jeep was. Avg'd 25 mpg. 10 stars!",1
526,"Im 63 so I wanted a cheap, basic, mileage car. I guess in my generation the basics are the basics. I don't need, cruise control, auto windows and all the rest. I did get air, stereo, power steering , five speed (dont need automatic). I also got gas mileage, that will come and go, though. I have gotten as low as 30.5 and as high as 39, it seems it's always this way, but this is honest mileage. Sticker mileage, brag mileage, and honest mileage. But the car is cute, rides good, mileage O.K. but it's NOT a turnpike cruiser with the goodies. I love it, 9.5 on a scale of 10. But over 40mph keep an eye on the speedo.",1
527,"This is my first GM product. I am a self-described Mustang nut. My last vehicle was a 2004 SVT Cobra vert Mystichrome package. I have been critical of Vettes since the late 1970s. My last Cobra impressed on me, again, how uninspired contemporary Vettes were. Then the Z06 came out. After test driving a used 2006 model, I was smitten! We bought our Z06 on June 30, 2007. I am convinced and converted from Ford ""faithfulness."" This is the performance car for under $100,000.00!",1
528,"This is my fourth Chevy truck (2 Silverados, 1 Tahoe previously). They just keep getting better. I have never had any problems with any of them. The Suburban is by far the best. I have the Z71 package and love it. It is great for our large family either around town or on longer trips. Now if I can just get my wife to get one. (She is still not confident driving such a large vehicle.) If you need a large SUV, this is a great one.",1
529,"I was not planning on purchasing a Vue. After seeing the quality and test driving it, I was very impressed. I didn't care for the gas mileage, but figured it was a trade off for the AWD and power for Maine driving. I opted out of the original Vue with the 4- cylinder engine. Please take the lack of power into consideration when making your final decision. But, true to their word, Saturn took my 4-cyl. back and put me in to a 6 cyl AWD. What a difference in vehicles. Overall, the Vue has been a pleasant vehicle for me to drive. I use this vehicle for business and drive it every day. When you drive past an older Vue, you'll be proud of how far along they've come.",1
530,"We are senior citizens and bought this car for the ease of getting in and out and wanted to sit up a bit higher when driving. This car surprised us with how much fun it is to drive. It is very smooth handling and so far great on gas, getting the 27 mpg it was said to get. It feels like you are driving a much smaller car. We had a Honda Accord before and this one handles much nicer believe it or not. You will not be sorry if you buy this car. You will love it.",1
531,"I purchased the SLT 4x2, Black, oh what an eye catcher! The first week I took it to work I was in the parking lot during lunch every day, because my co- workers wanted to see it in and out. I even get people asking me to take them for a test ride in my SUV! It handles beautifully and my husband was so impressed on the handling of my Nitro he bought his two weeks later. I get between 22 and 27 miles per gallon (highway miles) city 19 miles per gallon). I have 4 grandchildren and I can ride all of them with comfort (no fighting). They love it! I am so glad I held out on purchasing a vehicle before the Nitro.",1
532,"Love it so far. We tested similar foreign and domestic vehicles, and found the Sorrento to be the best value overall. It has everything we need for a family of four. The instrument panel has a clean look and the dashboard controls are simple and straightforward. The ride is quiet at all speeds, and so far is very comfortable in the seating area. For this size vehicle, the cargo area is adequate for everyday use, and the rear fold down seats are easy to operate. The powertrain is strong and easily accelerates even at highway speeds.",1
533,"This is my 3rd MDX, I have had a 2001, a 2005 and now a 2008. This is the Best Bang for the Buck SUV on the road. Looks great inside and out. Good performance, good handling, decent feul economy (16 mpg on mixed driving) for a 300 horsepower engine and all these vehicles have proved very reliable.",1
534,"I have owned 2 other Pontiacs. My 07 is the best car that I have driven. Plenty of horses, sporty but luxury at the same time. I sell cars for a living at a dealer and when ever we get them used I try to get people to buy this car. I believe they are worth every penny!",1
535,"Was looking for a car for the wife. Leaning towards the Liberty, liked the look etc. and great cash incentives right now. From what I had heard Compass had no go. Test drove the Liberty then the Compass. The minute I drove the Compass knew it was the car she would enjoy. SUV look, had plenty of get up and go, plus the ride was so much better than the Liberty. It was what she wanted and is a lot more than I expected. Only options we got were the automatic, Drivers Convenience Group (recommended), the E Package (power windows etc.), Yes Essentials premium seats (recommended). The car drives great, plenty of room, zips down the freeway. Everything we wanted and more for a great price.",1
536,"I was not too sure on this vehicle or the BMW 328. Once I found out that Mercedes eliminated Chrysler from producing their vehicles I felt much better. My vehicle was produced in Stuttgart Germany, which is great and this first run of C class vehicles were produced their also. If you wait too long you will get South African models which would make me guess on the labor quality. The ride is smooth and the acceleration is quick. The navigation and 12 speaker Harmon Kardon 7.1 audio is top notch. This is an all around great car with much more prestige than a BMW. Great job Mercedes.",1
537,I've had this CR-V for 3 months now. I have not had one disappointing moment. It drive just like a car. I don't have problems passing other cars or trucks. I've been to NY and it gave me 28 miles to the gallon. Around the city I get 23 miles but the combo is 21/22. I totally love this car. This should have been the first car I purchase instead I went in the opposite direction and purchased a 2007 Dodge Caliber (one of the worst cars on the road).,1
538,"Coming from an '06 330i. This car is feels like it's built like a tank. It has such a heavy feeling my wife feels really secure with. I think it feels too heavy, and a bit too soft, but not like a Lexus at least. You can feel the road below you, just with a filter whereas the BMW lets you feel everything. The engine is quite good, lots of torque in low RPMs. Fuel economy is not as good as a BMW, but respectable. Dealer installed Continental ContiSport3 tires. Wish they used something else -- they are really loud. And the navigation really is terrible -- only can direct you to a number range on any given street. Welcome to the 21st century, Mercedes!!",1
539,Great little car agile and tough lots of fun to drive. Great in the snow. A real winner.,1
540,"I bought my Hyundai in August of 2007 and haven't looked back since. It's reliable, fun and roomy. When comparing to other similar type vehicles (equinox, RAV, etc.,) you simply can't beat the reliability and price.",1
541,"I just purchased this SUV after looking at, reading about and test driving almost every small SUV out here.This is one of the sharpest ones, inside and out, on the market. It has every standard feature you would need and the dash is black and shiny and looks really expensive. The interior design altogether is just beautiful. Great job Mazda!!",1
542,"After owning sports cars for 26 years, Toyota Turbo Supra, Dodge Stealth R/S, I finally bought a practical vehicle (of course I kept the Stealth as well!). To my surprise the performance of my 2008 Xterra has been great, I've only lost about 1.5 seconds 0 to 60 (6.9 on timed track), handling is great and the fit and finish is wonderful. The 6 speed keeps it as a ""driver's"" SUV. My kids finally can fit comfortably and my over all mileage has been 22 MPG. It's a tough, beautiful performance SUV, I may just keep it forever.",1
543,"I cannot believe how excited I am every time I drive my new Elantra. All of my friends absolutely love this car (as do I). I spent 4 months researching and test driving new cars, and for only 17 grand, I have never, and I mean NEVER encountered a car that looks as classy and has so much value. I have the optima white with beige interior and I have to say I like the design of the dash in the Elantra even more than the one in my partner's Audi A3 (though I have not a single complaint about the A3). Overall, a wonderful vehicle. Fun to drive, classy, and a great bang for the buck!",1
544,"I have had many trucks, all brands, some have been better than others but this Tundra is the best one that I have ever had. It is so much fun to drive that I'm looking for reasons to go out! I bought a 2007 SR5 SB in Nov 07 and while it was OK, I really wanted the LB version without the Off-Road package. So I sold the SB with only 1389 miles and bought the SR5 LB and couldn't be happier. It rides smooth, has unbelieveable power, and gets decent mileage. I have installed a back-up camera, fog lights, self-dimming mirror, in-channel visors, sill protectors, duals and bed extender all OEM and the great thing is that it was already prewired for all the electrical installations. I love this!",1
545,"I moved into this car from an '07 IS250 and have never looked back. While it is not the same Tron-like driving experience, I could not ask for a more appropriate car for travelling with my family. It has all the space we need, decent mpg and is amazingly comfortable for short or long trips. We chose this over a SUV because the large trunk will keep items from hitting the kids if we are ever rear-ended. We were already t-boned once by a RAV-4 whose driver had a senior moment, and we were able to drive away with no injuries and less damage than she had.",1
546,"I got a 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix GT in white with the tan leather interior with only 27,000 miles for a first car (You'd say spoiled brat, but let me just say I got a hell of a deal!). My siblings who drive Hondas say it's incredible. The ride is smooth, it's extremely comfortable with tons of legroom, the Monsoon sound system is insane, and this thing is FAST. I am in love with this car. There is not one thing more I could wish for, I swear. If you are looking for car, take a look at the Grand Prix. The ratings I gave it are honest, this thing is more fun to drive than my moms Mustang GT. And whoever says there's no back seat room has gone mad.",1
547,"We currently own a 2004 Forester which my wife drives and loves. But the Forester is very noisy above 50 MPH. We bought a 2008 Legacy 2.5i Limited and I have driven it just under three hundred miles. The trip computer makes you very conscious of your gasoline consumption. I averaged 28.4 MPG on the first tankful. This was town and country mileage. The car is quiet and reassuringly rigid. Several people have complained about the sound system. Maybe I have tin ear but the system sounds just fine to me. As far as I am concerned, this is another outstanding car from Subaru.",1
548,"I wanted an auto that my husband would hate! When we went in to pick up My new Element. He fell in love with it. I selected the Metallic Root Beer SC. What is so great, it accommodates tall people really well. He's 6' and my son is 6'4"" and there is head room to spare. Now this is what is really awesome, the base part of the Honda Element is about the same size as an compact car but the box design allows for more interior room and it fits in my garage easily. It maneuvers very well.",1
549,"Purchased Veracruz LTD AWD in February 2009. The vehicle handles exceptionally smooth, is well equipped with many standard features and is a complete joy to drive. The sound system is decent and came equipped with the DVD package. A surprising feature NOT included is a jack for an Ipod. Gas mileage hovers around 20 mpg. Not great but comparable to other vehicles in it's class. I would recommend Hyundai as a vehicle brand for people to seriously consider. With the amount of rebates on this particular vehicle, the strength of it's warranty and the assurance plan in place, you cannot go wrong.",1
550,"My CX-9 is certainly a solid, smooth driving vehicle. I've had it since April 07 and have discovered what an excellent vehicle I purchased. It handles on par with much sportier cars, has good power; pickup and corners unlike my expectations for a rather large, over 5,000 pound vehicle. The interior is understated, yet sleek and quietly upscale. The front seats do a fine job of keeping your backside centered even during hard cornering. The engine is powerful and smooth; mated to the six speed transmission, driving around town or on the highways is very pleasant.",1
551,"I bought this car new w/the Grand Touring package and optional nav system. Wow! Mine is black mica. Body is aggressive yet tasteful, and the 18"" wheels and larger spoiler distinguish this car. The controls are intuitive and there are many luxury features (i.e. auto a/c, 6 CD changer, Bose stereo, steering wheel controls, auxiliary input jack). The seats feel awesome and hug your body. The performance speaks for itself. Great handling, ridiculous amounts of torque, all around solid feel on the road. My only complaint is low gas mileage 16 city, 25 hwy. However, bottom line, I love the car.",1
552,"This GMC Acadia had got to be one of the most solid vehicles built to date. From the luxurious interior features, sleek body style, and the powerful engine, the Acadia is a must drive for anyone. I got my Acadia 4 days ago and all I can say is wow! Just sitting behind the wheel lets you know you are in for a fun drive. This car performs and without much effort. The interior is gorgeous. Of course you have to get the SLT package. The dual sunroof is the coolest thing. I never had a power liftgate but always wanted one. No regrets there. The rear DVD entertainment system is very nice. The kiddo just loves it! You need to drive one of these very soon. You will not regret it!",1
553,"Bought the Avalanche to replace my Silverado. Couldn't be happier except I can't get my wife out of the Avalanche! Got the White Diamond package with 22"" wheels. Took it to the car wash last week and when finished the young man asked for the owner and another customer said he wished it was his. Two of the young men wiping it down mentioned what a ""sweet ride"" I had. Drove from Utah to Texas and back fully loaded and averaged over 20 mpg at over 70 mph. Extremely comfortable ride on the open road! The folding steps are great! I'm over 6' tall and my wife is 5'; the adjustable pedals and memory seats make the truck a joy for both. Almost a year and a half and no visits to the shop.",1
554,"So far I like the car, very sporty. Rides and handles nice, good pick up for a 4 cylinder. Good visibility, no obstructions, can see very well even with spoiler.",1
555,"For long I have wanted a SUV, but It seem to me that there was not one available with a gas conscience. I always thought that GM made big, clumsy, thirsty, cars, boy was I wrong. I just love my new VUE. The looks is great, the interior is amazing, and the quality is reaching the same quality demanded from an average consumer. The engine is powerful and you can barely notice at the gas gauge, like in the old days. The VVT seems a bit slow to react when going to high revs, but when it gets there you will notice. The heated seats are not very useful down south, but came standard with the trim package. The 6 six speed transmission sometimes is also slow to react, ( My previous car was a 5 speed",1
556,"I was looking for a compact car with great mpg, enough room for 4 other passengers, lots of features, reliability, low-maintenance, and good resale value. Civic was the perfect fit. Just bought it a month ago. Many people complimented on nice atomic blue color. I'm somewhat disappointed by the mpg. I realized that the advertised 30/40 mpg is unrealistic, but I still expected it to be better than what I'm getting. I got only 21 mpg on the first tank, then average 28 mpg after that (combined city/highway). It doesn't seem to get any better, but I'll see. MP3/WMA player is nice. Audio control on the steering wheel is great. Must get used to not being able to see the front of the car.",1
557,"This is my 3rd Lexus vehicle and looked at Acura RL, Mercedes CLS, Mercedes E, Lexus LS 460, and Lexus ES 350 before purchasing my GS 350. The GS 350 is such a beautiful car unlike anything else on the road within this price range. If you have the money to spend, spend it wisely and get the most car for your money. Black on black with Lexus 18"" chrome wheels, navigation, XM radio, and rear spoiler are such a beautiful combination.",1
558,"We traded in a 2005 Saturn Vue because of our growing family. It is more comfortable, quieter, than the Vue. The Vue was much faster due to the Honda V6 that it had, and it was better on gas. For being rwd, the TrailBlazer did great in the snowy season we had in Detroit Michigan. We never got stuck, or slid off the road. We average 15mpg in the city, and 20mpg on the high way.",1
559,"We just purchased a 2008 Black Limited w/ navigation and sunroof. Did not opt for DVD since no kids and 3 dogs. Overall first impressions are great. Smooth ride, comfortable, very quiet. Fit and finish looks great. Navigation is easy to use as is the bluetooth function. Voice recognition is a little difficult to setup. Previously owned a Toyota Sienna which had several recalls, not as comfortable, and overall did not impress. Traded a 2007 Hyundai Entourage for Chrysler. The Hyundai was a good van but lacked several features and depreciation faster than you could imagine. Put this van at the top of your list!",1
560,"I picked up my new SR5 CrewMax yesterday. It is a gorgeous vehicle, Silver Sky exterior, with black leather interior. It seems to have very good road manners, tracks very straight and stops very straight. It is fast and very smooth, like a luxury sedan. It is also a big vehicle and you sit quite tall in the saddle. My truck is equipped with a lot of the extras that come standard on the CrewMax Limited, but my truck was $4300 less than a Limited, so I feel like I got a very good value for my money. The fit and finish are fantastic. It is the first vehicle I have ever owned where I can find no blemishes, interior or exterior.",1
561,A pleasant surprise i have an automatic XR handles better ont he corners that my 2003 mitsubishi eclipse gt --- what? i know i could not beleive it either,1
562,"Love it, first BMW, traded in 300 srt8 and so far only positive things to say about BMW. Not as fast as srt but it has enough punch to snap your head back. It handles simple amazing. Expensive but still less then MB cabrio and performance of MB is not even close unless you get AMG. The small trunk has plenty of space. Highly recommend!",1
563,"I have had my Toyota for under 30 days, I had been looking for a smaller SUV for over a year and had test drove everything from the Cadillac SRX to the Acura MDX, and at the end I finally narrowed down my options to the Toyota Highlander. The Highlander without a doubt has proven to not only be a more spacious vehicle, the new body style is awesome, looks almost like the 08 Lexus LX570. It has a sound ride not to mention how many mpg I get in the city (15-17) and (18-19) on the freeway. My kids absolutely love it and I love the fact that the 1st oil change isn't until 5000 miles.",1
564,"This is an all around great car. There are a few things missing that really surprised me coming from Honda. First the fuel economy around town is between 15 and 16 MPG rated 22 mpg. The car is driven mainly by my wife albeit on short trips but nothing exceptionally dramatic. The highway mileage is right on the rating, 25 mpg to 30 mpg. The lack of a center console and just a shelf is annoying. The arm rest on the front seats, useless, way to small. The telescoping and adjustable steering wheel no help for a long legged person trying to enter when the wife leaves the seat forward. The sun visors are to short turned to the side windows. I would recommend the car all in all a great car.",1
565,"We are new to the minivan thing so i can only say moving from the 2005 Nissan Altima I am very pleased with the Quest so far. Drivability has been great, it handles very well for a minivan and has plenty of room to boot. Looking at the 06 model versus the 07, I have to say they are moving the design in the right direction on the styling.",1
566,"This is my second RX. Just traded in the '04 model and I'm blown away with all the upgrades. Clearly there were focus groups held and Toyota/Lexus listened! Better acceleration/power, better fuel economy, and all the right upgrades to the navigation system. I bought again based primarily on the RX's proven track record for reliability, no test drive, no haggling, and I was blown away when I sent to pick up the car. Everything on my wish list from the '04 was delivered.",1
567,"After a lot of research, I found that most cars simply do not accommodate tall guys like me. This one is S-W-E-E-T! I am absolutely thrilled with the vehicle. Utterly dependable, Highly ""customizeable""(new word for me there... lol). Mileage could be better, as this year has the aging Camry 2.4L. I am averaging about 34 mpg, with mixed cargo and passengers. This is the fourth Toyota I have bought, from the '76 Corolla, to my convertible '81 Corolla SR5 w/the 3tc. Kicking myself for ever selling that one, but the Scion more than soothes those old wounds. Summary: great head room, decent mileage, and always great to be the first on the block with a toy. Two BIG thumbs up!",1
568,"I bought this car after coming back from Iraq. I test drove the g35x but I liked the ex better. I have almost 12,000 miles in the last 4 months. The car is quiet and has great acceleration. I have been pulled over more times for speeding by the police than I have in the last 10 years. The brakes are the best I have ever had in a car.",1
569,"True Mustang fans can tell anyone, hey if your not a mustang fan keep your comments to yourself. Since I purchased my Shelby most people always ask ""is it fast""? My first response is to say no, a 1976 Pinto could trash this junker. So I give in and say ya 500 hp can make anyone grin. People always want to compare cars. If you like Vettes buy a Vette, if you like Vipers buy a vVper, etc. All cars are different in shape size hp, torque, etc. That's why living in America is so rewarding. An average Joe like me can build his credit up and buy what ever he wants with in reason. Point to my story, Shelby Gt 500 holds true for being first once again, so here comes Dodge and Chevy trying to out do Ford.",1
570,Our Freestyle is a great family car as it adapts very quickly and easily. My nine year old son has no problem flipping the back seats when extra cargo room is needed but it is also great to have seating for six when needed. Car handles very well and is easy to drive. I wanted to get my wife a nSUV but not a large one. The Freestyle is a perfect choice for us.,1
571,Have owned the '07 Patriot since April. Was the last one on the lot for '07s. Got good deal. Did a lot of reading before test driving. Was looking for a more economical vehicle- still have Dodge Dakota Quad V8 but it sits in the driveway most of the time. Kept it to haul trailer & boat. Got the fully loaded version. Seats are very comfortable-both my husband and I have bad backs and have yet experienced any problems. Drive city & highway-have just got to 3000 miles and am getting 22-26 mpg. CVT took some time getting use to-really like the fact that you can't feel the gears change.,1
572,"This is a great SUV with superior handling, comfort, and overall appearance. Fuel economy is edging toward the v8 area, but considering the size of the mdx, it gets pretty good mileage. Ride is very smooth and the 300 hp gets it up and going quickly. Recommend the mdx to anyone looking into an SUV with the performance and luxury you get with Acura, and the reliability you can expect from Honda.",1
573,"This car rocks. Great handling, smooth ride, quiet interior. Awesome sound system. Heated seats, OnStar and the list just keeps going. This is the car has it all for the right price. The car is fun to drive and a comfort to sit in. Make this car one to check out when looking for a new car.",1
574,"This is my 2nd vehicle from Honda first being an Odyssey, which was great except for the run flat tire issues. I sold my '07 X5 3.0 & leased this car and saving a lot of money on the monthly payment. Compared to the X5, the MDX is roomier, more high tech, better acceleration & breaking and priced well below the X5. However, there is no comparison when it comes to build quality and attention to details as the X5 wins hands down.",1
575,"""CHAMPAGNE TASTE ON A BEER BUDGET"" probably covers everything that you need to know about the new Passat, and for all you non-drinkers, you just plug in your cool key and drive. The value to cost ratio is excellent. I tend not to keep cars for over 3-4 years, so as for reliability, the Passat will probably work just fine or will be covered under warranty. On the other hand, my wife has the C. Beetle and she loves it.",1
576,"I needed a vehicle with great gas mileage, yet big enough to hold luggage, two keyboards, stands, an amp, a large box of equipment, a large dog crate and a bicycle. I can fit all of this and more into my little Civic Hybrid. While shopping I actually had salespeople attempt to load my music equipment into a Prius but it would not fit. This little Civic is a joy to drive, looks great, is quiet and comfy and has all of the safety features I have come to love and trust about Hondas. I get anywhere between 43 to 57 miles per gallon, and find this to be a zippy little machine. I previously drove a Chevy Malibu and loved it, but for the savings in gas the Civic wins the day. Sweet little car!",1
577,"2007 Ford Fusion SEL (4 cyl. 4dr sedan) I'll be honest, I never thought I'd own a Ford vehicle that wasn't a Mustang or a truck but the Fusion has changed my mind. My husband and I purchased our '07 in May of this year and we've loved every minute of driving this vehicle. The Red Fire Metallic with the Charcoal Black leather interior turns heads and my Dad who has always driven Audi's thinks this car is extremely impressive. We drove it from NJ to KS on our family vacation this year and couldn't believe how comfortable it was. Do yourself a favor and get a Fusion. You won't regret it. We plan on purchasing a second Fusion in Spring of '08 for me.",1
578,"The car is smooth and responsive, making for a great handling vehicle. It had surprising acceleration for a 5 cylinder. The leather seats are the most comfortable I have ever had in a car. On trips, the longer I drive this car, the more comfortable it gets. The cargo space is enormous. The interior is well laid out and with the leather package and wood trim, very luxurious for a wagon. Best car we've ever had.",1
579,I love this car; but triple with the white arm rest is whacked. Could get a little better gas mileage.,1
580,"Absolutely the best car I've ever owned! Great style, fuel economy, interior is flawless! Those foreign cars just got beat with a world class automobile! It's so quiet inside traveling down the highway and the stereo is fantastic. What a way to travel!",1
581,"I've had my max for a few weeks now and I love it. I've driven many V6's but this CVT is, by far, the smoothest, and one of the quickest. It adjusts to your driving style so when your taking it easy, it drives in a higher gear for better fuel economy, and yes as someone said, it can feel a bit lethargic off the line in that mode. Feels like it starts in 2nd? However, if you drive a more aggressively, off the line, at 100 mph, or anywhere in between, this car is a beast! It automatically adjusts and rides in higher RPM's to stays in the ""sweet spot"" where are the power is. It's very sure-footed in corners with hardly no body roll, but feels a bit heavy. All around a quality built car.",1
582,"I purchased my Passat in November 2006. I absolutely love it, but it has had multiple cosmetic problems. My biggest problem is that the leather seats have discolored, and I am getting no help from VW on resolving this issue. I've also had trouble with the Bluetooth (installed by the dealer after-market), and the Nav system had to be replaced after it got ""stuck."" Except for the purchase experience, I have had nothing but customer service trouble with two local dealerships (not the one I purchased it from) and VW Corporate. I love the car, but as soon as I am not upside-down in the note, I will sell it and get a Lexus, just because of the customer service.",1
583,"Was hooked after my first drive. Handles very well for what it is. Getting about 18mpg by keeping my foot ""out of it"". Should get better mileage on the highway. Installed a K&N air filter and use Mobil 1 synthetic oil. The motor seems strong and is always willing to rev. It's easily handling the current No. Indiana winter. No problem, from mushy slush, to blowing thru drifted-over county roads. It tracks and runs well. Could use better visibility but you'll learn to drive with the mirrors. Ventilation could be better. Having a small issue with the paint job on the hood. I do plan on keeping this vehicle for a long time as it feels strong and has a basically good build design. I like it.",1
584,"This is our third Passat (first a 1993) and it is the best. The car feels like a much bigger and more expense automobile. No problems and only expense is the scheduled maintenance. I alternate between Plus and High Test gasoline and runs great. I was most impressed by the highway MPG. I always get between 31 and 32 MPG with one trip turning in 35. I would recommend changing the oil more often than VW recommends. 10,000 miles seems a little long.",1
585,"We looked at the Mazda 9, very nice, looked at Honda Pilot/CRV and Toyota RAV and Highlander, and the Hyundai Santa Fe/Veracruz, nice also. But when you compare all of the features and standard stuff, the Suzuki really blows them away. Adding the no deductible, 7 year 100,000 mile warranty, free loan car, that covers exerything except the battery and tires! Even a burned out bulb is covered! Amazing. And the Japanese made GM motor is smooth and powerful, and all the safety stuff gets is a 5 star rating.",1
586,"This is my second Equinox. I previously leased a 2006 AWD LT. I recently bought the 2008 because of great dealer incentives. This one has much better handling, fewer blind spots, and a excellent, comfortable ride. I like the standard OnStar, which I used to have in my leased Trailblazers (3 of them). The gas mileage is excellent (25-26mpg hwy) even though I'm still in the process of breaking it in. I get a lot of compliments on it and it looks very sharp in black. I also got the remote start and it is awesome (cheap add-on, too). I looked a lot of vehicles and am so glad I bought this one.",1
587,"This is one great car! I love to drive it, steering is tight and it turns on a dime. Love the gas mileage - close to 30 city and 42 highway. Fit and finish are great. No problems with car. Inside and out, the styling blows the competition away! Many compliments on the way the Civic looks!!",1
588,"Had the dreaded engine issue that is common for these twin turbos but as long as I buy Chevron gas, it's no problem! Love the features and the performance capability. The fact that I won't pay for the first 4 yrs of service is a bonus. If you're looking to buy a new one, check into the European Delivery pkg so you can try it out on the Autobahn! U won't be disappointed.",1
589,"...it gets a whole lot better. This is a very inexpensive car for a Honda, so I am not averse to fixing what I don't like. Odd driving position! I splay my knees out to the sides and use the cruise control as much as possible. I still grumble though. No dead pedal! Zeta dead pedal, HIGHLY recommended. No center armrest! I bought a pricey JDM Honda center console; inexpensive console/armrest addons are available. 22K miles so far and the car is still a pure hoot to drive, which is a big deal for me; boring cars stink. I get close to 40MPG without trying too hard. And it's still cute as a bug. I'm keeping mine!",1
590,"Awesome car! Recently took a trip 335 miles each way, averaged 39.5 miles per gallon. The car handles well and is comfortable and relatively quiet. All the standard safety features make this car an exceptional value.",1
591,"I bought this used with 9000 miles on it, still has a new car smell. Overall, this is a well-thought-out, practical yet fun car. It is versatile and safe too. I came from a V-6, but do not miss it at all. This 4cyl does the job nicely.",1
592,"Had my vehicle for over a month now, and I LOVE it. Nice interior, nice ride, great style - especially for the price. You just can't beat this spacious SUV and its 10 year warranty. It has a luxury feel with an affordable price. Beats Saturn Vue, Honda CRV and Toyota Rav 4 in all areas. Great family vehicle!",1
593,"The Fit is one sweeeeeet ride. Comfortable, economical, great shifter, zippy performer, handles well. Even though it is a four-year-old design, it shows why Honda garners so many awards and loyal customers. I have heard it compared to the Chevy (Daewoo) Aveo in looks, but The Fit is a much more integrated design, and the interior is light years ahead of the Koreans. No other small hatchback, urban runabout or wagon comes close to the Fit, except perhaps the Scion xA. It is Storm Silver Metallic, sort of an almost charcoal grey, with black interior. The only major flaw is the lack of a sunroof option. Honda, great job! I will surely take a close look at the next-gen Fit in a few years!",1
594,"We just bought the car 5 days ago. The power is intoxicating to say the least! Brakes are great. The interior is so much nicer than the 2006 model. The seats have good side bolsters for those spirited backroad jaunts. The fuel mileage is pretty poor at 18 mph average so far. Hopefully it goes up a few more points after break-in period. The ride is similar to the BMW 325is coupe I had a few years back, sporty but not too bumpy. Haven't driven in the snow yet, but I assume the all-wheel drive and the narrower 17 inch tires should be ok. Once the snow is gone, this car will get a set of 18 inch sport wheels and tires. I think the Boxster will stay in the garage until spring!",1
595,"I've had my Nitro for net yet a week. So far, I love it. I'm getting good gas mileage, 18 city and 23-24 hwy. I love the kick from the 4.0L engine. Great bold styling! I get a lot of comments and questions. It's great! The R/T comes with the bigger tires and nice wheels, a nice extra.",1
596,"This is my 3rd JGC, having traded in a 2005 JGC Laredo. Getting into an 08 JGC Overland with the 5.8L Hemi was awesome. The power and acceleration is amazing for an SUV. Gas Mileage so far is about 15 MPG in the city, not too bad for a big engine. Ext. looks are good, and the interior is sharp and refined. Lots of extras with the Nav, Sat. radio, Bluetooth, Back-up camera, etc. I chose this JGC over the Acura MDX because of what you get for the price. Dealer incentives made the JGC more affordable than the MDX. Plus I got the same or more bells and whistles and a vehicle that will leave the MDX,CX9, and RX in my dust. Great Truck!!",1
597,"I've had my Equinox for four months now and am very pleased with my purchase. I test drove practically every SUV in the class and the Equinox came out on top. I came close to buying a Rogue, but the interior was cramped and lacked features. I am partial to the exteriors of the RAV4 and the Ford Edge; however, they are also lacking in the features department (at least on the basic models). The Equinox comes with a lot of bells and whistles for the price. I love the OnStar feature and the information screens. With one push of a button, I can check my oil life, tire pressure and remaining gas mileage, etc. The fuel economy isn't bad for a vehicle its size. Overall a great purchase.",1
598,"It's hard to find fault with this one. It's stylish, has unique bells and whistles and performs while providing utility and comfort. BMW truly is the ultimate driving experience. It far surpasses the Mercedes sports sedan I traded for it. The only other vehicle I've owned that compares to it is the BMW 5 series I once had.",1
599,"Car magazines under rate this car, while owners rave about them.Lets start with the outstanding good looks of the vehicle, no other car can compare to it for looks. So I would advise those who test these cars to ""look again"" and rate them more fairly. If you had to buy a car for your own use you would want one of these.",1
600,"I traded my 997 to to get what I perceived to be a peaceful luxury car that delivers a violent, soulful motor on command. I couldn't be happier. No more annoying tire noise competing with the sometimes flatuent, contrived exhaust note. Instead I get full luxury (including double-paned windows and felt lined wheel-wells to ensure tranquility) punctuated by refined violence upon driver demand. I also get an ipod interface and bluetooth. When I miss my 997 I can always take out my 87 911 for a visceral run. And when I really require a jolt my F355 delivers without fail. The S8 is always the car I reach for first... that says a lot.",1
601,This is a great car-nimble and fun to drive. Have it for 3 months and so far I have encountered no problems. I really like its keyless feature-you don't need to insert key to start the engine (like an expenssive car). It's highly recomended.,1
602,It's a jack of all trades vehicle. Plenty of room for the kids. Hauls all my stuff. Decent mileage for commuting. Has a somewhat bouncy ride but it's a truck and truth be told does ride better than most other trucks I have ridden in. Has really light and easy steering. Real easy to drive. The transmission is a dream. Smooth shifting and usually grabs just the right gear. You can slap the stick for quick acceleration. Tows my boat very easily.,1
603,"With just 200 miles on the odometer, this car already says it all, power, comfort, and agility. There are probably other cars with more of each, but this one has a nice balance of all three. The Harmon Kardon sound system is worth the upgrade. However, the sound from the engine is even better. Just wish it had ""real"" fuel and temp gauges.",1
604,"I love my GXP especially since nobody else has it yet. I'm always asked what's a GXP, they don't even realize it's a G6. Looks so much different than all the others. I love that!",1
605,"I'm still on the first tank of gas on my Elantra SE, but so far I'm very pleased with it. Rides very well on city streets and highway. Feels bigger than my Mazda3, but not as big and floaty as a Sonata. It's the perfect size for myself and my family. Pickup is good and gas mileage is in the high 20s on the first tank - sure to get even better with time. Very high-quality interior, though I wish it were a lighter gray (it's a nearly-black charcoal gray interior). A much better car than the previous-generation Elantra.",1
606,"Great safety package standard, smooth, powerful ride. Nice upgrades. Limited model with power sliding doors and liftgate is great for families with kids and their hands full. Stylish design, roomy interior and great pricing.",1
607,"I've had this vehicle now for about 9 months and completely love it. Mine has most of the extra bells and whistles, and I have been totally spoiled by the features - even the ones I thought I'd never use (keyless entry/start, lane assist, back up camera). With the 21 inch wheels this thing corners and handles more like a sports car than a SUV. But the beefy curb weight (while providing for a sense of security and impervious-ness-ity) definitely makes for less than thrilling accelerations. I expected this though when I bought it, so no surprises there. A few minor issues with squealing brakes and the like have been promptly handled by Audi care and all-in-all I am very happy with my Q7.",1
608,"We cross shopped Audi A6, Q7, Infiniti M35x, Cadilac CTS4, Acura TL and RL, after we returned a 2006 BMW 530xiT. We finally decided to lease an RL because it has all the basic elements of being a luxury car. This is the 4th Honda/Acura we had owned so far. And probably the most conservative Honda/Acura we ever have. Having said that, the RL is still a wonderful car to drive. Only hope 3 years later, Acura can have another face lift base on the coming 2009 RL (it is NOT attractive at all) plus a RWD-biasd AWD. Then I think we will continue to be in the Honda's family.",1
609,"I have had my R32 for 4 days now. I had previously owned a 1995 Jetta VR6. I knew what to expect with the power and performance. However I had no idea how smooth and precise the DSG was until my First Road Trip - from Detroit to Atlanta (750 miles). I learned that ""S"" means See Ya later! I was comfortable and enjoy the drive. Unbelievable handling and acceleration! This vehicle is low key and stays under the ""Radar"" with police. I look forward to adding a Cool Air Intake in the coming weeks to help with gas mileage and possibly more.",1
610,"Purchased this 07 Jetta 2.5L 5cyl 2 yrs ago brand new, has been a very good car, handles great on highway. Have had to replace the gas tank door on warranty. The bad thing is I have to buy the Catrol full synthetic oil at AutoZone along with filter for local mechanic to change the oil. Love the 10k mile oil change intervals. This car has been A++ excellent compared to our old 2003 Passat which was a nightmare (since assembled in Germany, compared to the Passat in Mexico). Car is very sporty & sometimes catches people's eye.",1
611,"Love the interior room, looks and over all choice of this car. It is noisy in regards to road noise and it is fairly uncomfortable on long trips. The 08 did get a bit of a blind spot when it gained the extra length. Good car in general. Great for hauling. Just totaled ours. Will be replacing it with something a little more comfortable.",1
612,"This is my fourth Explorer and they just keep getting better! The features, versatility and the price can't be beat. The V-6 fuel ecomomy isn't great but, I get the same MPG that I got with my Acura MDX and I don't have to run premium fuel. The Sirius radio and Sync system are great. Towing two SEA- Doo's GTX's takes a little effort, but the vehicles handles and stops well. The third row seats are great for kids under twelve and I love the power up and down feature. The second row seats recline but they do take a little effort to move up and out so people can get into the third row.",1
613,"We looked at the xA, xB, accent, Rio, Spectra, Civic, Sentra, Corolla, and others but after testing the Fit ...no contest... the Fit is far better than the others... its combination of looks, feel, room, features, price, & mileage are unmatched... definitely need to get the Sport... more than worth the extra money... the Civic has less room, less flexibility, less features, and less looks (opinion), all for a couple thou more... only advantage is more power.",1
614,Got this car last month. Its amazing. I like its engine - much better than 1.8L Honda Civic. Definitely would recommend. Totally worth the price.,1
615,"We just purchased this Grand Prix, and so far have nothing but positives to say about it. And I'm a die hard Japanese car buyer. But, after speaking with many Grand Prix owners, researching and test driving, we took the step to domestic. We've met many owners with mileage well into the 100,000k, many over 150,000k, on model years '03 forward, with little if no problems. Ride is fantastic, corners like a pro, with little ""roll"". Interior comfort excellent, quite and well mannered on the road. Acceleration is excellent, and we're getting 28 to 30 on these mountain roads of SW Virginia, which by the way, the car does very well in the snow and ice. We kept our ""Subie"" as a second car",1
616,This is a great riding vehicle with good space. I love the amenities and that it uses regular gas. The transmission stinks. It's always searching and you have to tromp it just to keep up with rural traffic but on the highway it's fine. Gas mileage has been 14mpg commuting and 22mpg on the highway. It is a very quiet riding vehicle though.,1
617,"Wow! So much to say, so little space. I have been looking and researching this segment for nearly five years. I really wanted a Tacoma, but even with the low car sales plaguing the industry, Toyota didn't want to play. Honda immediately offered me an incredible deal on this 08 RTS that I didn't need any more incentive- I snatched it up. This is an incredibly smart truck- all space is usable; seats are comfortable, even in the back where I was concerned most because this often overlooked space is easiest to get cheapest attention (Chevy Colorado). Absolutely the smartest design in this category (if you're looking for heavy hauling, look to full size trucks); fits me like a glove. LUV IT!",1
618,Bad mama jama I haven't towed my 5th wheel yet but will soon. 12.5 mpg @ 65 mph with a 4.88 rear end I have 14000 miles now and when I had 7000 miles I got 10.5 mpg.,1
619,"I traded in my 2002 V6 Mustang for a 2008 EX Civic back in November and it's the smartest thing I've ever done for many reasons. As a former Ford man who always trashed Honda, I have to say I LOVE THIS CAR! The gas mileage is incredible for the amount of fun you can have. I'm 5'11'' and I feel totally comfortable in it driving for hours. Not to mention, the VTEC in it is plenty powerful enough stock - let alone the abundance of aftermarket parts. The 8th generation Civic is a winner for sure.",1
620,"I test drove a lot of midsize suv's before deciding on the endeavor. I had a 2004 Tahoe z71 and traded it because I wanted better gas mileage and a better warranty. This vehicle is so nice to drive, feels stable, great gas mileage, my kids and all their gear fits comfortably in this car. And it can tow our four wheelers without a problem. The sound system is awesome with the subwoofer. By far better than the others for the price. We got the dvd system and the kids love it when we are on road trips. Great investment.",1
621,"Bought the MDX for utility, but drive it for fun now. I have an older Audi A4 quattro sedan, and was looking for a larger vehicle with more reliability for my weekend golf and ski trips. Didn't think I would prefer driving this full time. It corners as well as the A4! I can also load lots of gear in the back, and rear seat passengers sit in comfort. I compared this to the BMW X3, X5, 328xi wagon, Infiniti EX35, FX35, and the smaller sibling RDX. The MDX has an unbeatable combination of performance, utility, luxury, and price! Yes, price! While gas prices are high, you can get this vehicle for under invoice prices!",1
622,"I have had my quirky black Yaris liftback for about three months now, and I couldn't be happier. The first couple tanks of gas worried me, because I wasn't getting the mileage I expected, but since then it's been great, between 32 and 40 mpg depending on the mix of driving I'm doing at any given time. I love the styling inside and especially out. Even for an hour-long commute, which I sometimes have to do, the ride is quite comfortable for such a small car. The seats are perfectly comfortable for me. The steering and acceleration are very responsive, which make it fun to drive, not what I expected for such an economical price.",1
623,"Great super car! I have owned 2 Porsches, 2 Caddys, 6 Marks, 1 Infinity, 6 Vettes and many others. This is the absolutely the best and greatest experience of all! Awesome acceleration, superb handling, good comfort, excellent reliability and good gas mileage. It's all I expect from a car and it's made in America.",1
624,"After driving may competing alternative vehicles, the Enclave out classed them all. Although it took 4 months to get, it was worth the wait. Every aspect of the Enclave is very satisfying. It is obvious from many ""minor"" details that much engineering went into the development of the car. As the owner of 4 Buicks prior to this one, it is the best I've driven in 20 years. The car seems bigger once inside that it appears from the outside, yet it drives nimbly. Anyone that wants a vehicle to carry more than 4 people comfortably needs to drive the Enclave before purchasing any other vehicle. Great Job Buick!",1
625,"I've had it for a year now and still love it as much as I did when I drove it off the lot. I especially love the interior design and dash layout. It is very classy and well organized. The performance is also pretty amazing. Stepping down hard on the gas makes me forget I am in a crossover. The dealer is great and has always been very detail-oriented when appeasing their customers. I definitely recommend it if cargo space is not your highest priority, but you don't want to restricted to a smaller sedan.",1
626,"We have been looking into getting a new car for a while now and we were blown away by the Rabbit. The look of the interior and exterior are great and it has way more standard features than expected. There are so many little features and neat things about this car that I feel like a salesperson every time I tell someone about it! The ride is comfortable and smooth for a car its size. It has a ton of room inside to fit four people comfortably. It handles really nicely and has a lot of power. It shifts really smoothly and quickly for being an automatic and the Tiptronic is fun to have (even though I don't really use it all that often). Seriously, this is an incredibly fun car to drive!",1
627,"I love this little car! It has as much room as my 96 Camry did. I can fit my 10 speed bike in the back with the seat down. It was a good buy pricewise too. I am planning to put 300,000 plus miles on it.",1
628,"I've had my Liberty Sport now for about 3 months. I was first drawn to its rugged good looks and 4x4 reputation. I have to say it the interior is extremely comfortable and the seats are very supportive. Acceleration from a stop is very good, but highway passing... forget it. The V6 feels so sluggish that you have to jam your foot on the gas pedal to get the transmission to downshift into 3rd gear. Everything on this Jeep is great, but they should have revamped the engine and transmission instead of using the version from the old Liberty.",1
629,"My Corolla drives great, I made a great choice in buying one. I plan to keep it as long as it will last, I have a feeling that will be a long time. Toyota does not play around when building their vehicles. Everything seems to be tuned to perfection.",1
630,"Out of searching for a good SUV, this one is perfect. I got the D package, because I hate power windows, and remotes, so it saved money. It has 4x4 with the Freedom Drive I CVT2. I bought it for road driving, but got 4wd in case I need to go off-road for something, and for snow and heavy rain. So far, it has been great. It handles very well, and now that I'm getting used to the CVT, has great acceleration. You can really feel the AWD help in daily driving, and the 4wd locking lever is easily accessible So far, been having about 24 mpg on average, with a combination of city and highway driving. This is definitely the vehicle for the more sensible buyer. And best of all, made in USA!",1
631,"This is by far an excellent ride. My previous vehicle was also a Liberty and what a difference. The 08 Liberty has much more room and also sits higher. It's a more stable, smooth ride and handles well in the snow even when it's not in 4X4. The rear and front seat fold flat. The previous Liberty did not and also the front seats had to be pushed all the way forward in order for the seats to fold down. That is not the case with the 08 Liberty.",1
632,"Lots to love about this car. For the low price, you get AWD, tight suspension, pretty good MPG, fun, and room. The base stereo (4 speakers) is actually OK and doesn't distort at high volume. I will be adding the Subaru subwoofer soon. The ride is great and the car feels like it has claws that attack the road. 5 spd is fun since you have more control. Trunk loses some space as it raises toward the back because of the new double wishbone suspension. Interior is good for the price. Plastic used on the door and dash, but for $16k I don't mind. I like the looks of the 2007 better, but oh well. The 08 is more ""grown up"" looking.",1
633,I gave my Acura MDX to my daughter and was looking for another solid SUV. Fell in love with the MB GL450 at first sight. Beautiful inside and out. Then saw the 320CDI version and drove it. Couldn't believe it was a diesel. Who would believe that you could have large comfortably luxury in an SUV and get 27 mpg on the highway? I was only worried about recent MB quality surveys on Consumer Reports but felt a little better given that the GL was totally redesigned.,1
634,"1st new car for myself and love it. It looks rough and rugged. Body style and the ride is what hooked me along with the price. Smooth ride, nice radio, great sun roof. Plenty of room in the back for storage. Goes like butter on the beach.",1
635,"Traded out of a V6 Accord due to my long daily commute and gas prices. Got 37 MPG first tank - 80% highway. This is a nice little economy car that is well equipped and reasonably entertaining to drive. I am 6'2"" and could use a little more seat travel and the seats themselves won't be fun on long trips but that isn't what I bought the car for. The OEM Goodyear tires were ""squishy"" and didn't inspire confidence around corners or on the highway. I already swapped them out and am far more pleased with the replacements. My Accord had Michelin Pilot Exalto's and they served me well. The drive train is relatively refined and the 5 speed manual is less notchy than the 6 speed in my Accord.",1
636,"Bought this car to advertise my business, can't miss it! Everything else is a bonus, goes up Vail pass very fast, fuel average has yet to drop below 28.6 mpg- better than advertised. 1st car I have ever owned that does not need snow tires and we get 200+ inches a year here. (traction control that works) hauls kids, adults, groceries, skis, you name it. The instruments in the center are much easier to read than the regular kind.",1
637,"This is my favorite purchase ever! I was looking for something smaller and a little sportier and I couldn't be happier. It has just enough cargo room and I'm surprised at what I've been able to fit in the trunk when I put the back seats down. The doors are nice and long which makes it easy for people to get into the back seat. I have to say that I'm really happy with the amount of interior storage spaces and cup holders, my friends and I use my car to go everywhere and we're always comfortable and we have a lot of fun. The only thing I miss about my previous car is the automatic headlights. When I first bought this car, I kept forgetting to turn the headlights on and off.",1
638,"I like my Jeep Patriot. It is a very good vehicle. When bad weather hits I never have to worry about getting to where I want to go. It gets decent gas mileage for an SUV, and I haven't had any mechanical problems. I wish it had an automatic transmission instead of a manual transmission. All-in-all, it's a good car that I would recommend to Jeep lovers.",1
639,"Turned in my 2006 Ford Explorer, a great riding vehicle with many features that fell short on interior comfort and visibility. The Highlander is spacious and comfortable with excellent visibility in most areas.",1
640,"It's only a few hundred pounds lighter than the 3-series, but it feels a lot more light and nimble when you drive it. Both manual/auto transmissions are great: the shifting action of the manual is precise and confident; the clutch is predictable and easy to engage. There isn't much sacrifice at all in ride comfort because of its relatively tight dimension and suspension tuning. It truly is a great fun little car to toss around. It's certainly not as edgy or raw as the M3 (E46 or E92), but feels as quick and manuvable if not more (especially when compared to the new portlier E92 M3), and it has better gas mileage.",1
641,"I really wanted to own a car that was a practical family sedan but had the look and feel of something more. This car is fun to drive. It is quiet, comfortable and feels so solid. We have the LTZ V6 and it really doesn't lack any power.This car replaced a Chrysler 300M and I really don't notice a drop in quickness and power. I do notice this car handles very well and if you are not careful you will be speeding constantly. You really don't notice the road noise or engine rev. This car is really loaded with options for the price.",1
642,"I bought my 07 CRV in May 2008. People have stopped me at gas stations and grocery stores to ask me about my car! It is comfortable, reliable, and fun to drive. My last car was a Chevy Tracker with 4 cylinders so I was skeptical to get another 4 cylinder, but once I drove it, I noticed a huge difference. The tracker was like trying to push an elephant up a hill. The CR-V isn't like that. It doesn't zip onto the highway like a corvette, but it can get the job done with no problem and sure doesn't feel like an elephant. I love it and it's the best purchase I've ever made.",1
643,"Best vehicle I have ever owned. Rides smooth and the interior never fails to impress. AWD is superior and the build quality is second to none. For the price the Lexus and Acura can't touch the B9. So far two friends about to buy Pilots, even had deals together, bought B9s after test driving them at my suggestion. It certainly is worth a look for anyone in the luxury or near luxury SUV market.",1
644,"I was looking for something sexy to replace my Jeep Liberty and certainly found it in the Crossfire. It's gorgeous, fun, and gets much better gas mileage. Of course, it helped that the dealership knocked $12K off the list to sell it...and yes, it was brand new! Is it worth the list of $37K? No and that's why they're discontinuing them. But, for $25K? Absolutely!",1
645,"Great performance, acceleration, handling etc. Considering its weight and size mileage is suprisingly good. usually 18MPG+ on the highway driving at 70+ MPH. ------------------------------------ - It has been fixed now but the rear hatch would sometimes open without any input from the remote.",1
646,My family loves this Suburban. The space is comfortable and they love the DVD player and the radio. The fact that we can listen to different things at the same time.,1
647,This car performs awesome. I love how tight the steering is but wish the ride was a little smoother. Being AWD you can take a turn so fast ( try those hairpin turns on the interstate) the car grips the road the entire time without slowing down!,1
648,This is the third Honda that I have owned and once again I was more than pleased with its performance. Driving a hybrid takes a little getting used in reference to how quiet it is but it handles just as well as my Accord did. I drive about 120 miles a day and have really noticed a savings in gas and time at the pump! If you are conscious of how you drive you can really get up to 50 mpg. This is the best car I have ever owned!!,1
649,"Great car, cool looking, hatchback is cooler looking but I like the huge trunk room of the sedan. Rides great for econ car, better than most mid size cars. Lots of room for long legged people. Acceleration is good, not that I really care about that, the car has lots of options and standard options I like. Best looking car of its class, very modern look. It is Our 1st Nissan and so far we are very impressed. Easy to park, even in city. Ride is nice , I have a bad back so I feel all the bumps on the road and it is the only econ car that I have ridden in that doesn't cause me undue pain, and comfy seats, and head doesn't hit roof when on bumpy roads like some econ cars. THE BEST.",1
650,"Had my doubts as to how refined the Forester would be coming from an '02 Infiniti G20. But I was pleasantly surprised by the solidity and finish of this vehicle. The size is just right for our soon-to-be 3-person household and the volume of the trunk cargo area is very useful. The fabric of the seats seems very durable, interior plastics are of reasonably high quality, and the dark gray color us nice. Visibility is excellent and the turning radius is nice-n-tight for in-city driving/parking (trust me, this does matter). The stereo speakers could use a little more low end oomph, road noise is bit loud, and the seats are not as comfortable as our Infititi but otherwise we love our new Subie.",1
651,"So far we have had this car for about 4 months. My wife absolutely loves her car, she feels it is easy to drive and the most comfortable we have ever owned. I like the sporty feel (when she lets me drive it), and it never lacks for power. If you are looking for a new family car check out the new Passat, you will not be disappointed.",1
652,"I have owned 5 Honda Accords over the last 15 years. I was about ready to buy another when I test drove the Altima. Immediately I could feel the difference. The Hondas are very smooth, reliaable and actually boring. I found the Altima fun to drive. I like the car more every day even though I've only had it for a month. The leather seats seem more comfortable than the Accord and I like the home link. Hats off to Nissan for finally making a car that I feel is comparable and even better than my reliable, plain Hondas.",1
653,"I was looking for a car with good gas mileage and enough room inside for my 12 year old son who is now 5'11 1/2"" tall. He needs room to grow over the next 3-4 years of anticipated ownership and is supposed to end up about 6'6"" tall! We checked out a variety of cars in the similar class, with fuel efficiency & cabin size being the #1 priorities. Not only does the Aveo offer ample headroom and decent leg space for a compact car, but it's paying for itself! The reduced insurance cost, improved gas mileage and decent styling led us to this car. Our former car was an Xterra, and there is as much interior cabin space in this tiny Aveo as we had before - but more then twice the MPG's.",1
654,"I recently purchased this car, so I don't have many miles on it yet. My first impressions are it has a very nice build-quality, perfect for the family, and the (AWD) all-wheel-drive is spectacular! I previously owned a BMW 528 and going to a cross-over like the Tribeca was easy.",1
655,I think this is a very under-rated SUV. It is so much nicer than the Envoy which is more popular. Very quiet and the fuel economy is about like everything else.,1
656,"From the outside, this car doesn't look much bigger than my 2005 Taurus, but specs say its 20"" longer. The trunk is massive -able to fit two bikes in there with extra room. Haven't tried to fit it into the garage yet! Kudos for the 6spd transmission. It shift just where it ought to shift and still provides an avg 24mpg on the big 6-cyl motor (Highway I'm showing 28mpg!). Radio sounds nice and is easy to operate. Sunroof is well-designed with pop-up to reduce wind noise. I'm two weeks into this car and am very impressed. Just wish they'd made the ""ink blue"" color a tish lighter; it seems, from a distance, to be black. Will follow-up at six months.",1
657,This vehicle drives like a dream SUV. I am very impressed with the interior and exterior components along with the overall smooth ride and drive.,1
658,"2 1/2 weeks old, 650 miles, and loving every one of them. This is my second Subaru. I have a 2004 Legacy Limited Edition and I had to get another. I love my Impreza. Getting about 28 highway and about 24 city mpg. I could not ask for more. Super fun to drive. 170 hp and feels like more. To this day both of my Subarus handled and held the road like no other car I have ever driven! Can't wait for the first New Jersey snowstorm! Dark Grey Metallic paint is beautiful and everyone says so. Wish it had fog lights, they will be coming soon! Great car for a great value",1
659,"after taking it for off road for the first time even it was smooth ride on sand the steering axcel became noisy, they fixed it, now it came again, i think it is a week point in it. other than that every thing looks good. performace is good, it was stable even on 200 km/h i dont regret having it",1
660,"I've owned 4 Hondas of which 2 were CR-v (07 and 08). Compared to the Xterra they didn't stand a chance. The Xterra is solidly built and they thought of everything. Also you get so many features compared to the Hondas and the Xterra is customizable. I really love mine. I've had it for 3 days so far, but I am really enjoying the ride. It's high up, visibility is great, and it's built so solid. No annoying rattles, etc. The plastic interior is very high quality and I feel that it's laid out perfect. Everything is in the right place. Power everything, mirrors, doors, windows. and it came with high quality mats even! I hope Nissan keeps up with not sacrificing quality.",1
661,"The car can be summed up in one phrase: performance and luxury in a compact design. I drove a 2003 and 2005 3.0L A4 prior to getting this one and the performance stands up well. There is definitely noticeable turbo lag, but this can probably be overcome by changing driving habits. The sound of the engine will also take some getting used to as the turbo is a bit ""throatier"" than I'm used to. The car handles extremely well, though, hugging curves and accelerating very smoothly. The now-standard S-Line exterior features definitely give the car a sportier look. The interior is outstanding. The layout is getting better and the list of available features is exhaustive. In all, a great car!",1
662,"This is an excellent choice if you're looking for flexibility. The interior volume and configuration options are excellent. Very quiet interior. Smooth driver due to long wheelbase, yet still has a tight turning radius. Drives like a car, with the space of a wagon, and the size and capability of a larger SUV.",1
663,My Rondo is so nice to drive and it is great to not be a mini van mom any longer but still have the room. I will miss the cargo room though that my van had if we have 7 passengers. When it is just the four of us and the dog we are comfortable for a long trip.,1
664,"I don't usally write reviews but I felt I needed to write this one. I've owned this car a week so I've still got new car fever. I've been driving a Ford Supercrew for 7 years so going to a Prius was a new view on the world to say the least. If you are a big vehicle driver you need to check this car out... no regrets. My 2 kids have enough room in the back even with me (6'1"" 220 lbs) in the driver's seat. We all have room to spare. My wife and I find ourselves fighting over who gets the car. Our first tank of gas got 46.7 MPG and we are doing even better on our 2nd.",1
665,"I think this van is great. I always told myself that I would never get a minivan, but with kids it's a must. I think its the best looking minivan on the market, both inside and out. So far I haven't had any of the problems that some have complained about like excessive road noise or squeaking. This van has tons of room and the backup camera is awesome. It drives just like my accord which makes driving it much easier for my wife. Out of all the vans I researched, this had the highest rating and now I see why.",1
666,"Just bought the 2WD Limited edition. Took it for a test drive before buying but I didn't notice the poorly designed inside door handles. It seems when you try and use the electric window switches the handle gets in the way. Try it you'll see what I mean. I have a 2003 Highlander and it rides better then this 2008. This 2008 rides more like a truck with the 19"" wheels. All in all I think it's one of the best out there. They just have to twik it a bit. Also, it's bigger than my 2003 which I think I like, I'll have to get use to it.",1
667,"Overall, very satisfied, but have a few warnings. MPG is hopelessly below what the EPA sticker says (barely get 20mpg in city). Although the trunk is voluminous, the opening is smaller than the Century and I find it difficult to get large objects inside. And whoever put that piece of chrome across the middle of the dash so all sunlight from 10am to 2pm shines directly in the driver's eyes needs to be flogged.",1
668,"First time Ford buyer. Loved the looks, the comfort, the performance. Sat in other SUV's including Lincoln and Lexus, no difference. I actually liked the Edge better. After 1,000 miles, I like it even more. Who knew I would become a Ford believer. What a solid vehicle!",1
669,"Short review.... I get 26.5 mpg overall mpg, posted seems low. And I go pretty fast. Bose stereo is a waste of money. Basic system is fine, and the OEM speakers they use are very good--even if you replace the head unit, stock speakers are solid. Seems Bose didn't tune the system because it rattles terribly. I'm an audio dood; Bose are clown shoes. A safety recall on engine mount, an ""unofficial"" recall on d-link in rear end, and a throttle failure in first year. Occasionally belches smoke. Hmm. Interior design is nice. Lots of rattles. Good cargo capacity. More fun than the WRX, feels faster, snappier brakes. Clutch is sticky and 'sudden'. Best 'fast' car for the money, by far",1
670,"My first Audi and so far is excellent. Loaded A5 (all options except S-line package), ride is fantastic...great in corners, straight, smooth and very quiet on highways. Acceleration is very good and feels quick (better then my '05 Acura TL), especially in sport mode. Audi delivers amazing interiors with high quality. Backseat is okay for small kids, but almost unusable for adults. I'm a tall/big guy who fits very comfortably up front. Technology is great - imports entire Blackberry phone book in one shot with excellent Bluetooth connection. MMI is not difficult to learn, but can be cumbersome. Voice activation not live on the A5. Overall, great blend of luxury and sporty ride.",1
671,"Before you buy a Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic. You owe it to yourself to try out the Mazda3. The 3 handles great, incredible brakes! Very comfortable seats. Nice ride. Looks great! The manual mode in the auto shifter is a nice feature.",1
672,"The first thing that impresed me was the engine - it is small but quite powerful. One just has to push the accelerator pedal down to get most out of it. The acceleration is especially impressive with the gear in the sport mode - even from a zero start. I love the exterior design. Tthe same goes for the interior, with some reservation for the front seat ergonomics - they are comfortable but could be a bit more accomodating. To add a ""fly to the ointment"" - I already had to get the sensor switch in the passenger seat safety belt buckle replaced. The dealership experience has been very good so far.",1
673,"Goodbye Honda Pilot - work horse. Hello Enclave - luxmobile ! Everyday enjoy it more and more. Spacious, very quiet, smooth ride, handles very nicely, and has lots of admirers - strangers just stopping to take a look or ask about it. Loving it.",1
674,"I just purchased a 2008 Hyundai Veracruz Limited FWD and drove from Texas to Kansas. This vehicle is very nice, and comes equipped better than a Lexus RX350. It also has a better warranty than the Lexus. The third row seat fold flat and is big enough for two adults. I was going to buy the Nissan Murano but the third row plus a better deal than an equivalently equipped Murano helped me choose the Veracruz. The exterior and interior fit and finish is very nice with tight tolerances. It's quiet at highway speeds, six speed automatic transmission with manual mode, and loaded with just about every convenience you could want. Power liftgate, leather heated seats, heated side mirrors, sunroof, etc",1
675,"Great car. Love to drive it when I can get it away from my wife. Excellent mileage. Good performance for a 2.0 litre. Styling turns heads and gets compliments. The toys inside rock. It's a total 21st century rig. Lots of room for the size of the vehicle. Overall, we love this car.",1
676,This SUV has great style both inside and out. This a a great car if you have one or two kids and the dog. It's actually less than advertised in the city and pertty good in the hwy. I just think it really lacks on pick up. It needs more power. Would have been great in a V6.,1
677,My lease was up on my 04 325i. Saw the pics of the c300 and had to see it in person. Immediately fell in love. The ride is superb. The car looks and feels more like an expensive luxo-car. It's comforts are so much better then my BMW.,1
678,"I love the choice that I made to purchase a Fusion. The ride is very smooth, it has plenty of storage, and everything is easy to operate. Most of all, it is very good on gas.",1
679,So far so good. Lots of features. Great driving experience. Safe and reliable. very stylish. great appeal with design. good performance. Nice brakes. Attractive wheels and excellent traction with Goodyear tires. Handles well in mountain driving as well as freeway. Probably the best car I've owned in 30 years. The SS Chevy is a great value and every one likes the car who see it when I'm parking the vehicle. Lots of extras for an American revolution! Go check the car out for yourself. The vehicle sells itself! Thanks General Motors I like the car!,1
680,"After years with an A4 Avant, this has not been a step down at all! I figured I would be sacrificing space and luxury for MPG and the convenience of a compact, but not really the case; roomy interior and meticulous detail (I could live without the carbon fiber trim look, however). Way easier to park in the city, better mileage, and far quicker than the A4. Overall, if you don't need the Quattro I can't see a reason to get a new A4 Avant when this option is out there.",1
681,"Until I got to the dealership, I had never heard of a Yaris. 2 hours and much test driving later, I would not have bought anything else! The interior space and comfort are incredible for this size of vehicle. I love the extra room with the fold down rear seat. Better gas mileage was my ultimate goal. After feeding a Trailblazer every 5 or 6 days I am looking forward to seeing the gas pumps 2 times per month! Excellent vehicle that I have an will continue to recommend!",1
682,"This is my second srx. Bought first in 2004 when it first appeared. Loved that one. But the 2008. Is much nice. Nicer interior, better ride, love the look.",1
683,"This is a great car. However, there are three areas worth consideration: 1) it is very difficult to pull out of the front seats while exiting the vehicle, (2) the front doors swing out so wide it is extremely difficult to reach the handle and close the door, 3) while backing out there is a major problem seeing what is behind you when you look over your right shoulder (blind spot between right rear window and back window).",1
684,"I wasn't in the market for a new car until I was helping my sister buy her first new car and saw what a great deal the Focus was. I was able to get it for $13,200 out the door and loved everything about it. I had an 06 Corolla CE in manual and hated it. The quality of the Focus engine is well known (probably better than the Corolla) and so far the fuel economy is better. The Focus looks, runs, and drives better. I have to say I love this great American car.",1
685,"This car is an absolute blast to drive. Who ever said American car companies don't build cars people want? I will line up any Toyota, Honda, Nissan, etc. against this baby. For the price it can't be beat. First off the torque is unbelievable. HP is immediately available. No need to wind this baby up. You won't want to play the excellent 500 watt Shaker stereo radio as the exhaust note is the best sound you will ever hear. I test drove 20 different cars but when I got in this one I knew I was going to have to purchase it. Very easy to have fun driving around town and you will get 17-24 mpg on 87 octane. Fill the tank with 91 octane and hold onto your seat.",1
686,"I was fortunate to be able to get the third Lax Super made at GM's highly acclaimed Oshawa assembly plant. So far, no problems to report. The car's acceleration, exhaust note, and seating comfort are great. It came fully loaded, except for the sunroof.",1
687,"We bought this car for my wife (but of course I had to get it with all of the toys for me). We looked at the GMC Acadia, Mazda CX-9, and the Toyota Highlander. None of the above really compared to the highlander in terms of style, options, and reliability. Initially we were not considering a hybrid, but one came to the lot in our area. With gas now approach $3.50 a gallon, I am beginning to think we made a good decision. With our 3rd tank of gas, we are averaging about 26.2 mpg. This should improve as we break in the engine. The navigation takes a bit of practice to master, but after taking one evening to sit down and learn it, it is quite simple.",1
688,"I can not say much bad about this minivan it rides very well, great on hihway mileage. It gets over 500 MPG on the highway and it has alot of great features and things to kee children busy.",1
689,"This is a great car - period. Honda has done an excellent job of reinventing the hatchback concept for the new millenium. Two roadtrips (ATL-DC and ATL-SC) so far and no complaints. Car is fairly quick, responsive and smooth, reminds me of a BMW to drive (except I'm getting 36 MPG at 80 MPH). In general, I favor European cars (BMWs, Mercs, VWs, etc) - but Honda has done an excellent job of integrating an intelligently-designed vehicle (great safety features, innovative cargo handling, excellent fuel economy) with outstanding road feel, handling and suspension.",1
690,This is the best car I have ever owned. I get 34.5 mpg. hwy and 27.5 in the city. The only negative I would mention is that it makes a rubbing sound when backing up and the dealer told me that is standard.,1
691,"This is my first time owning a Sonata by Hyundai, I've owned a lot of cars over the years, and I have to say that this car rides smoother than any 4 cyl I've ever owned, the ride is smooth pick- up is great the trunk is very large. the styling is great ive added the all weather floor mats and the full bra, and the window vent covers it all looks great on the polar white. the fuel mileage is great for this size of car 26 in the city so far and haven't taken it on the highway yet. XM is great love the 6 speakers and sound. Saved thousands of dollars compared to the Honda and Toyota's.",1
692,"Great car. Comfortable smooth, sports car handling, excellent craftsmanship incredible power. Not as quiet as the gas engine but very quiet for a diesel. You have to listen to hear it. I average 25mpg, as much as 38 mpg on the road. However the GPS stinks. It's the worst. Difficult to use and I dont need to find ""border crossings"" in the USA. Just buy a Garmin, a 100 times better. Problems: transmission tends to clunk into lower gear as you slow down. Had a 2005 Benz with the same problem. Price of diesel a negative. Hate the center console, holds nothing. Service very expense. I would however, buy this car again.",1
693,"I originally had a 2006 Spectra which was totaled in an accident when someone lost control of their SUV after they were hit by someone who ran a stop sign. Fortunately the airbag worked well. I was very happy with my 2006 Spectra but before I purchased another one, I wanted to see what other options I had. I drove every make and model out there and could find nothing else that I was more comfortable in or satisfied with than the Spectra, so I promptly purchased another one and have not had, even for a second, any regrets. I even turned down a purchase of a 2005 Jaguar that was selling for the same price as the Spectra. I found reviews of the Spectra to be more reliable than the Jag.",1
694,"Plenty fast enough for daily driving, gives me an average of 33 mpg at 75 mph cruise control on long drives. It's not necessarily ""sporty"" compared to actual sports cars. It has stone hard economy tires and a soft luxury suspension. So take it for what it's worth or upgrade your tires and suspension. Looks are subjective but I still think it looks nicer than most cars even after the 4 years it's been in production.",1
695,"I purchased tc in may 2007. It is the release series 3.0 #737 of 2500 produced.$21,000.00 price tag. All options, except for the standard 5- speed manual trans. Added trd lowering springs, short throw shifter, anti-sway bars, strut brace, exhaust for additional $2000.00. Now my $23,000.00 investment feels like 30 grand. If there is something you don't like, just adjust to your application.",1
696,"Had vehicle about 2 months and satisfied. Was concerned about the CVT but so far no problem. Drove up to Yellowstone and back and got an amazing 34 mpg. Usually get about 26-27 driving around our local area. Paid between 25 and 26K for a loaded awd SL. Leather, Bose, sunroof, Intellikey etc. Very comfortable and large enough to do the job but small enough to be fuel efficient. We have a 3/4 ton 4WD suburban also but it only gets about 13-14 mpg so it sits in the back yard most of the time now. I have been a Honda liker and tried the CRV. Did not like the way the CRV handled, it seemed rather squirrelly to me at highway speeds whereas the Rogue runs straight and true.",1
697,"I was driving a big Honda Odyssey and getting 18MPG all around driving. I am getting a little over 30MPG on this new Focus and I love the way it handles. Where you turn the wheel is where it goes, great little car from Ford and just a couple little add ons would be nice. I miss the garage door opener in the visor & the automatic temp control, otherwise great care.",1
698,Have recently purchased the 2007 Maxima SE. Before that had a 2005 Altima SE. The Maxima offers great features with a smooth transmission (CVT). Very comfortable car to drive as I put on a lot of KM per year. Nice finishing touches inside Maxima logo inside evry door chrome acents. Drove a few luxury sedans G35 TL and pricing and options on the Maxima SE matched others and own 2 other Nissans 1986 300ZX turbo (my fun summer car) and 2005 Xterra.,1
699,"Had the car over a month and it's been great. I have a S2000, my son have an Accord and my wife had a 1999 Mustang GT Convertible. We were looking for a Lexus GS to replace her Mustang until we looked at the CRV. The lack of power is way over blown unless you're drag racing. I think a lot of the critic comes from the high expectation of this being an Honda. Love the ride and the dash blue light background.",1
700,"I've had my Compass for about a month. With all of the features that my 4x4 Limited has, it is a great value. I would have had to spend another five to seven thousand dollars to get a Honda or Toyota similarly equipped. Fun to drive, economical, and the darker colors are not bad looking in my opinion.",1
701,"I really wasn't planning to buy new, but with more than a $9,000 discount off sticker, how could I pass up a new Miata. Great car! I miss the go-cart feel and exhaust noise of the 93, but the ride is much more comfortable. Definitely leans more in corners. I'll be adding RX8 sway bars soon. Looking forward to many happy years in my new Miata.",1
702,"Excellent acceleration and handling. I have owned a BMW 328i and the G35x handles much better. The AWD is not only helpful in snow/icy conditions,but it helps the automobiles handling altogether. Accident avoidance or just exciting aversive driving is a strong attribute. Slam on the breaks and you will not only achieve a sporty stop but the pre-crash seatbelts spring into action pulling you firmly into the seat. My G35x is a little over a year old and I have not experienced a single problem!",1
703,When driving the Yaris you feel like an ice skater gliding over the ice. I have only had the car for 4 days but I know it's the best purchase I've ever made. The gas mileage is awesome as a commuter this will come in handy!!!,1
704,"I love this car and I can personally vouch for the safety ratings. A month after I bought this car, I was in a head on collision. My daughter and husband were in the car and we walked away without a scratch. This car handles well, has lots of storage space and I get 33 mpg (combo of city and hwy). Not to mention, it looks better than the Corolla, Sentra, and Mazda 3. Honda's last forever and for the price, you can't find a better deal. Not to mention, the resale is better than any other.",1
705,Took delivery early April. Have driven about 1600 miles already. Average mpg 23-24. Very lively and comfortable to drive. Like the dash layout and the feel. Nav system limits operation to while stationary. Unable to tell if the outside review mirrors are heated? Front seats comfortable. Rear seat leg space tight. Front seat heaters do not turn off automatically!,1
706,"I've been looking to buy a new Corvette for about 3 months. With GM reporting a sales decrease of 45% for October, I knew now was the time to pull the trigger. I bought the machine silver 2008 convertible with titanium interior and a black top. It looks great in the garage and I smile everytime I open the garage door. Absolutely no buyer's remorse. The only reason I gave the interior design a 9 is because I can't plug my MP3 into the stereo... what's that all about? The NPP dual mode exhaust is cool as hell and the magnetic selective ride rocks. If you're thinking at all about buying one of these, don't wait any longer. Now's the time do get a great deal on a great American sports car.",1
707,"I had a Z4 previously and loved it, but overall I like the 1er better. Meets or exceeds every one of my expectation. The 128i is plenty fast and is more practical than the 135i. The 135i is almost stupid fast and very few drivers will be able to get more than 30% out of what the car is capable of.",1
708,"I was looking for an SUV and decided to check out the Dodge Nitro. Didn't like the ride at all, too hard. Noticed the Avenger on the lot and thought it looked classy. Test drove it and unexpectantly fell in love..Purchased on a whim, on the spot. Love this vehicle!",1
709,"This is my first Hyundai and I'm very happy with the vehicle so far. Had thoroughly reviewed and test-driven several crossovers, including the Highlander, CX-9, Veracruz and Pilot. Overall, Veracruz offered the most options, the best warranty, and the highest bottom line value. I'm getting about 16/23 MPG city/highway, which is not bad at all given the vehicle size. If you're in the market for a comfortable mid-size crossover at bargain price, you have to test-drive the Veracruz.",1
710,"Loving it. Mine is Silver Birch with a rear spoiler, power moonroof and nice tint. I have had mine for a week now. I test drove this 4 times to make sure I was not hallucinating. The power of the dohc v6 is excellent. I would have bought the 4 cylinder if the deal would not have worked out on the v6. The styling is strong, distinguished, classy, understated, smart and masculine with ""man-grille"" up front anchoring this good handling ride resting on sweet styled 17"" alloys. Handling is great for this segment. Fit and finish makes this easily the best Ford sedan ever. It is the ""poor mans"" CTS and does have Caddy drivers looking.",1
711,"Overall I do like the car. It is fun to drive and has surprisingly good visibility (except on backing up). I like the look of the car both interior and exterior. In terms of pts for improvement: car has mediocre pickup. Seats aren't comfortable. I find my back hurts after just 20-25 minutes of driving. I've also encountered a number of problems that should have been worked out prior to release. If not, they should at least be flexible in dealing with the issue but they're not. We bought 2 Hondas at the same time, the CR-V and a Civic. Really wishing we just got 2 Civics. The Civic drives far better and so far has no issues. And it's significantly cheaper.",1
712,Very happy so far. I have the C300 Sport and I really like the exterior styling. The car is very comfortable and rides and handles very well. Pleasantly surprised to be getting about 25 MPG with the 7 speed automatic. Overall I feel it is a very good value for the money.,1
713,use it to tow behind a Motorhome works great not a hiway vehicle. great for two people and a little gear. Wish it had more towing like the 4 door,1
714,"Traded a 2003 Maxima which I was sad to trade in... solid, fast, dependable and the last Japanese built. The 2008 SE however is also powerful and an excellent freeway cruiser. Quiet, solid, and quick. Around town however it can feel over weight and lumbering. CVT took some getting accustomed to but now love it. No downshift lag when passing... just hit the gas and ZOOM! Now driving a typical ""automatic"" feels old school with all that engine revving up then down with each shift. Some interior materials feel a bit cheap which was a disappointment. Overall satisfied and will probably keep for 4 years then trade for 2012 Maxima. As my title states, once a Maxima owner, always a Maxima owner.",1
715,"I love the G35x w/ the 306HP it's great, however the MPG hasn't been over 20 MPG since I got it. Infiniti advertised 19/26 it's more like 13/18 and that's not good.",1
716,"Overall very happy I bought this truck - I've wanted it since I was 16, so it's about time! After 2k miles, averaging 18 mpg, w/ a range of 15.5 to 21 for city/highway driving. Definitely rides like a truck. Very happy with 4x4 performance - safely got me & my friends to the mountain w/o any problems. Double cab rocks. Great engine. Not very comfortable on long highway rides - a 4 hour trip to Boston was not comfortable. A minor complaint: my right toe almost always hits the wiring harness directly above the brack pedal when I switch my foot from gas to brake (size 9.5 boot)...FYI. Again, though, very happy I bought this truck - it IS the vehicle that drives by you that you wish you had.",1
717,"I absolutely love my 2008 CTS. I chose a 6 speed manual with the direct injection (304 hp) and for the power it gets amazing fuel economy. I have not had one single problem with this car since I drove it off the dealer lot. The cabin is comfortable, quiet and has lots of goodies to play with. Th exterior literally makes heads turn. The materials are high quality and the design is flawless.",1
718,I traded in an 02 Nissan Altima for the Maxima. I absolutely love it! It's very stylish and fun to drive.,1
719,This is a great car getting 34 mph highway with a manual. Capable of 150- 200 K easy. Too bad it takes Toyota to design such a great car for GM.,1
720,"I just recently purchased my 2008 Lancer GTS and I love it! I was the first person to purchase one at the dealership. My GTS is Graphite Pearl Grey, it has the sun and sound package. Drives very well and is very fun to drive. I got the CVT with the magnesium paddle shifters, they are so fun and easy to use! Definitely would recommend this purchase to anyone.",1
721,"I tinkered around with moving to a car from a SUV for several years. I began looking at Infiniti's, Lexus's, BMW's, and even Porsche's. The main draw of the E350 was the 4Matic feature. I am a work-aholic and don't like to miss work due to weather. After I found one at a local dealer, I took it out for a spin. Oh my, was it impressive. I loved the looks. I loved the power. I loved the comfort and fit. It was smooth and powerful. The seats are very supportive. The tranny is smooth and agile and the ride is perfection! After only months of ownership I am convinced I made a great choice. I haven't had it serviced yet which makes me a bit nervous. However, I expect a great experience!",1
722,"I have owned a LX for about a month now and have been pleasantly surprised at the gas economy and reliability so far. Most of the miles so far are on the highway (with the A/C on) and I have consistently obtained 34+ MPG, with the maximum so far being 37.8 MPG. The vehicle handles very well on the highway, but can be a bit awkward at low speeds. Does not handle turns very well, even at low speeds. Feels like the car is going to rollover if you take those curved exit ramps at more than 30 to 35 mph. But overall, considering the price, I am a very satisfied owner.",1
723,"We wanted to go green. We didn't know how we'd adjust coming from 2 new Audi A4 quattros (a 98 and 05). We got this and we don't regret it. It has enough zip. It's comfortable & roomy enough for 4 adults. I've only filled the tank 5 times. The first 4 I averaged about 36/37 MPG. This last one I did about 38 MPG. (402 miles on 10.5 gallons). Not bad comparing to my Audi but not the 40/45 advertised. The car was bucking this afternoon. Don't know what it is. I have about 1,500 miles on it now and it's not the first time it's happened. Overall I like the car and like the economy payment and low gas cost. We must all conserve folks. Buy economical. We liked it better than the Prius.",1
724,"I have over 3000 kms. on it and love it more every day. This is my 6th car (4th VW) and is my favorite by far. I love the handling, acceleration, looks, interior, and especially how quiet it is. It has tons of room inside and I really like how everything is laid out inside. I actually like the cruise on the stick and it is very easy to use (unlike previous Jetta models). It makes for a cleaner looking steering wheel. I have had absolutely no problems so far. It is built like a tank.",1
725,"Love it. Has everything, sound system, bluetooth (connects and disconnects when needed, tried other manufacturers' systems, not happy), voice control, best rear view camera that displays image in milliseconds and has lines and noise alarm, anyone can park safely. Also great when rearing with a boat trailer. Engine has so much trust. Cannot drive without intelligent cruise control anymore. Luxurious, comfortable and roomy. It is like flying first class.",1
726,"The new G is fast, and handles great. The Sport model suspension is firm without being harsh, and the paddle shifters for the 5AT are excellent. Inside all of the amenities are within easy reach, and the layout (especially the gauges) is outstanding. Sport seats are comfortable, and hold you snugly through any maneuver :-) The trunk space is pretty limited, and the rear seats don't fold down :-(, so there's room for even large suitcases, but not wide items. Fuel economy is pretty dismal, but to be fair I drive it in manual shift mode all the time, and rarely shift up to 5th except on the highway. Great car, great price, I'm delighted.",1
727,"I just got this car less than a week ago. This car is sweet, love to rev it over 6000 rpm where the vtec kicks in. Great interior and very roomy for a car of its size. My wife really wants to learn to drive stick now that I have this. My 6 month old's car seat fits easliy in the back where as in the coupe it was a hassle.",1
728,"I'm no stranger to performance cars,but i must say this new E 320 blutec is more fun to drive than my '06 911. The rush of power and creamy smooth ride low noise decibels, getting almost 40MPG! I was going for a S550 and test drove this E blutec and WOW.",1
729,"Love this FX35! This replaced the Volvo XC90 as I have safety, stored the Carrera as I have the power, performance and fun, gave the MDX to hubby, as I have the comfort, style and loaded features all in one car!! Handles like a dream, very comfy, beautiful as all get out! Love all the bells and whistles moreover the price.. not bad. Wish MPG was better however I won't compromise its performance. I wish I can keep this car a secret but people are catching on! This is the sports package of a BMW M for SUVs with the safety rep of a Volvo for us soccer moms!",1
730,"The new civic is a substantial improvement over the last design. I traded in my 99 SI civic for this one and I like the new car. I once owned a 1980 Civic that was fun to drive and rode 50 miles to the gallon. This car is way bigger than that was, but also feels much more luxurious than the 99. Yeah, it's not a $50,000 BMW, but I wanted a car that gets at least 35 MPG highway, so compare it to that field. The civic is much more interesting than a Corolla. The Mazda 3 is a worthy alternative, and you won't see quite so many either, but the new honda is very smooth. Honda has always been known for making quality engines, and this one very refined. Great fit and finish, don't buy any extra",1
731,"After having my 08 Highlander Limited, I must say it is one of the best I have ever had! After having many Toyotas, I wanted to try an SUV, and I'm so glad! The Highlander has all the luxury I was looking for, and a price at the top of my list. The ride is very smooth and quiet, and the V6 is so smooth and quiet, especially in warm climate. In the winter, it is a little loud until warm up, but that is normal as my Avalon was the same. The Highlander has plenty of room, nice dash, and the premium radio is a must! The bluetooth is great for the cell, and is safe while driving. The navigation is easy, and works well. The Blizzard Pearl is a great exterior color. Great SUV. Awesome !",1
732,"This is my second Lexus experience and it is awesome. I have owned a few European cars and Lexus is a much better over all package. The Lexus standard equipment is more comprehensive than its competitors which charge 10K more for the same car. The acceleration, ride, and handling are spot on. The leather is the best in the industry and the ergonomics are perfect. I read a lot of complaints about the hidden controls but I enjoy not having the dash cluttered up with controls that I do not use frequently.",1
733,"This is my second Audi A6 and this is an entirely new vehicle that was redesigned from the bottom up. On a 350 mile trip at avg speed of 75mph I got 30 MPG! Quiet cabin, great ergonomics,and the NAV is the best I have ever seen. The sound system is fantastic. Headlights are improved. I did find the sunroof to be a little small but it is not as important compared to all the positives.",1
734,"Purchased this SUV after driving an Infinity G-35x and missing the roominess from my previous SUV. Also, Hyundai was recommended by other friends who have one. Only issue so far is pulling to left. After two alignments, seems to be okay. Although steering is pretty sensitive. Like all the features, styling, performance (little sluggish in shifting between 1st & 2nd gear) so far, after 2000 miles. CD player is only 1 CD capacity?? If reliability holds up, seems like a very good vehicle for the price.",1
735,"I purchased my 2008 STI in March of 2008 and have been completely satisfied. It is fast, useful and the 2008 avoided the ""boy racer"" wing of older STIs. Some say the car has gotten soft - as compared to what? If a far better car and as fast as my 2004 Mustang Cobra and a powerful car with all wheel drive is simply amazing. The dealers are now discounting the STI heavily - my advice is if you want performance and durability - test drive the new STI - and gas mileage is 20-22 if you exercise some control. The STI is hands down the best performance car I have ever owned",1
736,"This car is a blast to drive! I feel like I'm in a sports car. I'm 5'9 and fit in with no trouble, as it is so roomy. I love the thumbs up, gawking, crowds I draw, and the oohs, and aahs. I've even had people pull in my driveway to have a look. The shifting takes a little getting used to but what fun!! Ever since I saw these cars in Europe I've wanted one. Best of all it is so easy to find a parking space!",1
737,Had the car a little more than 3 weeks. 2.0T w/ S-Line. Test drove the 3.2 but it felt too heavy with the 6 cyl. and quattro. Plenty of kick in the 4 cyl. The S Tronic shifters are responsive and addictive.,1
738,I commute 60-70 miles/day. Never a problem. Fun to try to max out mpg using the display system. Very smooth ride. Feels like a more expensive car.,1
739,"After considering the Highlander, MDX, Pilot, and Enclave, my wife and I settled on the CX-9. While not quite perfect for our needs, it was clearly the best overall SUV, and came out on top for functionality, ergonomics, and as a bonus, it didn't look like the box that a more attractive vehicle came in. We had only looked at the Mazda as an afterthought, figuring we'd end up with the Highlander, but were very surprised at the overall quality and attention to detail in the CX-9. While the Highlander had arguably better performance and interior storage space, it lacked many things the CX-9 offered, such as a split-row third seat and ample room in all three rows, among others. A very good buy.",1
740,"This late manufactured 2007 vehicle is a love to drive! Unless your clothing can be rolled up or a wear & toss type, trunk space is limited as is the 3 cups holder. Driving with the top down did not hamper conversation even at 80 mph. I had the most problems with the automatic phone connection due my accent! I've ordered a 2008 turbo therefore if this vehicle had not met my expectations and more, I would not continue to be a Saturn Sky owner. Very easy to drive and shifting never did present a problem.",1
741,"We have had our Saturn XE Vue FWD for 11 months now and recently purchased a Toyota Venza which we now can compare it to. The Saturn 4-cyl. is a very good match for this vehicle. The 4 speed auto trans. works very well, but I like the Venza 6-speed better. The Saturn has a very comfortable ride and has a great deal of room inside. The driver sits nice and high and this vehicle has an extra fat steering wheel, which I also like. The as built quality looks to be as good as the Toyota. The price makes the Saturn Vue an excellent value in the market, even as we see GM going through all of this change. I would buy another one without question.",1
742,"I bought this little gem after having driven a '99 Windstar for almost 10 years. It took a little getting used to the change in size, but overall, this has been a great choice in vehicle! I mostly drive in town, but occasionally get on the highway. I find I get decent mileage in town and excellent mileage on the open road. The car defies the laws of physics. It is very comfortable for even large people and can hold a LOT more cargo than it looks. I love how I can whip in and out of parking spots easily, or slip into the next lane of traffic without cutting off the guy behind me. Overall, it's been a great car to drive and the money I save on gasoline is a dream!",1
743,"Just got the 535i with premium, sport, premium audio, hd radio, ipod, satellite. The car is really fun to drive, the handling is incredible. I like the iDrive, it adds a little mystery and class to the car. But I received the car with a non function sos system. I have to return to dealer and have it fixed. I hope this the only thing that goes wrong",1
744,Purchased a Salsa Red Astra XR w/ auto and stabilitrak and am loving it. The handling is sharp but not uncomfortable over broken pavement on my commute to work. The Saturn car buying experience also made it so easy to purchase. The interior is extremely pleasing with the data information center and high quality materials throughout. I considered buying a Mazda 3 as well but I felt the Astra's interior beat it while being just as fun to drive. The main improvements I would suggest would be a little more power and more storage inside. I would have never considered a Saturn before the Astra but I'm glad I gave it a chance.,1
745,I was a little hesitant to lease an American car but to my surprise the Edge exceeded my expectations. I looked at the Murano and the Pacifica among other but the Edge seemed to beat them all. The handling is great and it is fun to drive. The backseat is very spacious and there is plenty of storage room in the rear.,1
746,Overall excellent vehicle. I am very happy with the way it drive and rides. So far for a brand new car gas mileage around town 25.1 mpg,1
747,"Bought this car new for practical reasons (not a 4 door sedan type person), and overall a decent car. Smoothest engine I've ever heard, bar none! CVT transmission works well and gas mileage averaged over 30 mpg. But overall a pretty boring drive. Handling is average, driver's seat too soft and lacks lumbar support, sun visor hits mirror when lowered, (bumper cover popped off, panels don't align well).",1
748,This is my second Hemi (1st was Dodge RAM truck which I also loved) and my 1st SUV. The Aspen is a total headturner. I constantly get asked about it. Love the ride and the J package rocks with the black metallic paint and leather interior. My husband can't stop raving about how comfortable the vehicle is and he does a lot of driving. Although he has to ask permission to drive my Aspen! Ordered all the options except DVD entertainment pkg. LED interior lights are great also.,1
749,"With just 200 miles on the odometer, this car already says it all, power, comfort, and agility. There are probably other cars with more of each, but this one has a nice balance of all three. The Harmon Kardon sound system is worth the upgrade. However, the sound from the engine is even better. Just wish it had ""real"" fuel and temp gauges.",1
750,"I have owned several MB before, but this one is a car that stands uo to a BMW in ride, and size. The performance is excellence as well as the handling. My car has two option the i-pod in the glove box a waste for me, but not my kids. Also the optional headlamps which are great for lighting your way. I strongly suggest this option for older folks, it help alot. So far the car is great, and the fuel economy is not bad either in the upper 20's combine with city and highway. This car is a lot for the buck, and truely a great value. This car car hums like a bimmer, and rides like a tank as a Mercedes should be.",1
751,"Fully optioned: AWD, black with black, DI 300hp engine. MSRP is $48,090. Which btw u cannot properly configure on Edmunds as the options they list differ somewhat then what Caddy actually will do. Without question the car draws attention. Ride is smooth & very tight though w/18"" wheels expect to get plenty of road feel; which is a new experience with Caddy. I extensively test drove the BMW 5 & 3 series and this car matches them in >95% of handling characteristics. A- Trans is like silk. Extremely minor flaw in fit, but it would only be noticed by perfectionists :). Rides very quiet, except on hard accel where you hear it growl. Motortrend said motor is rough at idle, but mine is smooth",1
752,"I love this SUV, Kia really stepped up this time. The 262 Hp really makes her move and gives you that extra passing power when needed. We just got our first big snow for the year and it did very well in 9 Inches of snow. I felt in control and very safe when driving even when I saw much bigger SUV's all over the road. I would tell anyone that is looking for a mid-size SUV this is the one hands down. Plus the auto 4x4 - it knows the road better than you do.",1
753,"I purchased the yellow SE in July and have been driving it everyday just smiling. The handling is great,and the seats are comfortable. I just love all the fun it is to simply go anywhere now in my new ""Sunflower Yellow"" bug. Gets tons of compliments and fits in the smallest spots. I updated mine with ""daisy"" steering wheel covers, flower vase, license plate, and seat covers for an even cuter look.",1
754,The vehicle was everything i dreamed about. Though it was tough to get because every dealer was selling them the second they hit the ground. Fireside treated me with the greatest respect and made me want to refer all of my friends. I love the car!,1
755,"This is my third go-round w/ the Wrangler. I have owned a '95 YJ (College), an '03 TJ(first married), and have now settled into the 4dr JK (w/children). The new 4 doors are functional with the new additions to my family and I do not have to sacrifice driving a cool vehicle. This is not a speed machine by any means, yet is fully functional for on road usage and the offroad capabilities speak for itself. The gas milage is fair given the ride height and lack of aerodynamics. If you own one of these you are in the club. If you want an Escalade experience when driving then keep shopping.",1
756,"I had a 2002 Jetta with 59,000 miles on it and the performance was great, able to handle the highway without loosing any grip. I bought a 2008 Passat Lux. I needed leg room and performance with an economy niche to it. This Passat is better looking than the Lexus. I have received more compliments on this vehicle style, color, and performance. I needed a good running car with a slight luxury texture that is not expensive in maintenance. VW designed the perfect car for me. Thanks VW.",1
757,"I've had my 2008 V6 4WD Rav4 for a week and lovin' every minute of drivining it. I've already tested the PSI warning light as I had a nail in the tire within a few days of purchasing. Had the light not gone on, I suspect I would have had a flat tire vs. being able to check it out before it went completely flat. Engine very quiet - to the point it sounds like it stalled. It's the perfect size - takes up the same space in the garage as my Volvo S70 - maybe even a little less space.",1
758,"Looking at the most fuel-efficient choices out there, I naturally settled on the Prius and Civic Hybrid (and held onto a secret wish for a Mazda 3 hatchback that could get 40 on the highway). The Prius had an appealing zen-like quality to it, but it just wasn't comfortable for someone my size (6'3""). Acknowledging my natural Hondaphile leanings, I drove the HCH (with some reservations over the supposedly ""underwhelming"" performance). After that, it was a no-brainer. It accelerates more than well, never once leaving me with that sinking, sluggish feeling. Add to that comfortable seats and billet-like build quality, and I feel I got a premium-class car with 45 mpg for $21.5K. Very happy.",1
759,"I recently went out and traded in my Trailblazer SS for a new Equinox and I am very impressed. The gas mileage in this thing is phenominal for an SUV (that's not a hybrid). I travel a lot for work so I have had many chances to get a feel for it and I really like it. My wife also likes it. The ride is very comfortable and is almost ideal for long trips. For those of you who like to ride high but also want good gas mileage and a comfortable ride, this is the one for you! I wish I would have got the AWD but my gas mileage would have suffered. Also 17"" rims are very nice a attractive!",1
760,"Just bought this truck to replace my 15 year old Chevy Silverado half-ton pickup. Got the LT1 package with 5.3L V8. First trip had 19 mpg with combined city and highway. In just the city, it seems to only get about 11 mpg. The truck is very quiet and rides well. So far, I'm quite pleased. Pricing was good in Sept with the GM employee discount and additional 5K discount. Also got $1800 off with my GM card savings and I qualified for an additional GM company card bonus of $500. Every little bit helps in this crazy economy!",1
761,"I had an 02 Honda Accord, 4 cyl., and wanted better mileage. I did a lot of research, and didn't find a better price for the mileage. I've only had it 3 days now, but I love the car. Small tweaks to the interior (longer arm rest/center console, and someplace to rest a cell phone) would be great. My only complaint in the rear view mirror. I'm 5'9"", and the mirror is right in my line of vision for intersection traffic. I'm going to have my dealer move it up. Great ride, I have no problem with road noise.",1
762,"I absolutely love this car! I owned a Honda civic ex prior to this car, and it served me well, but I felt it time to change to something that sits higher. Now on to the cool stuff - very impressed with the interior space, as were my 6'3"" friends! - drove 18 days on one tank of gas (just under 400 miles) and despite some high winds last weekend, I felt secure on the road. The blue tooth, keyless entry is a big plus -",1
763,"I recently purchased this truck almost a month ago for an excellent low price! The 4 cyl exceeded my expectations! The truck has plenty of power, handles great, road noise is lower than I expected and interior and exterior is sharp looking. Gas mileage is great! I wish the speakers sounder better, but hey, it's a truck! It also feels great to buy American!",1
764,"The Yaris has the looks and then some. For 106 hp, this car has pick up. I have gone 100 mph on it, and it feels very stable (except when there's a lot of wind the car feels like it's floating and not on the ground). Do not be scared to drive it on the highways. I have gone on multiple road trips with it and it is so much fun, especially driving through windy roads. I could not imagine driving any other car on highway 1 (of course except a Ferrari).",1
765,"This is for 2008 MB C300 Luxury. I traded in my wife's 2006 BMW 325 (I am glad I got rid of that disappointing car. So noisy my god the chevy 2500 diesel was quiter - no kidding). Love this C class though. Smooth, quite and fast enough for me (I am mid 40s). It does everything in Merced way. I owned the previous C (2003) and didn't like that one either. But his one is defeintly a winner. Thank you Mercedes to built this.",1
766,"Get 47.8 to 55.3 MPG. Package 3 that has more features than the car it replaced. Comfy ride everywhere I go. Sound heavy vehicle that is very smooth and fun to drive. Wasn't interested at first because thought it was too small until I test drove one. Very impressed with what I saw, and walked away that day with one!",1
767,"I could not be happier after living with this car for 9 months. Performance and comfort is exceptional. Great gas mileage (34MPG) with more than enough HP. Fun to drive, Everything works the way its supposed to. I would definitely buy again.",1
768,"I went searching for the safest vehicle I could find. This was pretty much it. It also happens to be about the quietest, smoothest ride I found. If there's a downside, it's that it's so quiet driving along at freeway speed, it's easy to let your mind wander. Doesn't hit 20 mpg though, and with premium fuel, expect 50-60 dollar fillups. But that's a small price to pay for one of the best vehicles on the road.",1
769,"The 2007 Volkswagen Passat 2.0T has excellent all around functionality, a great feel, great design and it gets good gas mileage too.",1
770,"This is one incredible vehicle. Perfect for my needs and one monster beast in the snow and ice. Great interior room, looks great from outside and I can easily haul just about anything. Love the fact no carpet to contend with, sweep and wipe and it's clean. Outstanding reliability. I have over 35,000 miles and have had no issues whatsoever. But then it is a Honda, I expected nothing less.",1
771,"We had originally test drove the Vue to eliminate it from our list of vehicle options, just so we could say that we had actually looked at all of our options within the price range we set for ourselves. But instead of eliminating it, it moved to the top of the list. Of the vehicles that we looked at, the Vue Red Line was the only one that we walked away from the test drive with that ""gotta have it"" feeling. It had all the power we wanted, looked great, a smooth quiet ride, and it drove like it was on rails. If you are looking for a sporty compact SUV, don't dismiss the Vue Red Line until you have actually driven it.",1
772,"We purchased our Hyundai Elantra around the middle of June. We already have over 5000 miles on it, and we have not had a single problem. We love almost everything about the car. It gets decent gas mileage-we are averaging 29 mpg city/highway combo. It has an excellent safety rating in Consumer Reports. It comes in some way cool colors. There is one issue we have: the back window is too small, so sometimes I'm nervous changing lanes, especially on the freeway. Anyway, it's a cute little car that does what it says it will do. In the Valley, you'll pay a little more-ours 14000 with no extras.",1
773,First Chevy I've owned. It's very roomy and comfortable. Love sitting high up on the road!!!,1
774,"I've owned the new Malibu for a full year now and I am still completely satisfied. Drives great, looks great and I have not found anything I don't love about it. The interior is awesome and the ride is very smooth. A year later and I still look forward to driving this car everyday. I don't think I have ever been this satified with a purchase. Definitely worth every dime I paid for it and then some.",1
775,"This car has been problem free for the last 22 months I have owned it. For the price I think there is no better riding small to mid-sized SUV on the market. I?ve had gas mileage up to 26 on a mixed driving. Quiet and smooth ride. The AWD works well on snow and ice. It is well worth the 28k I paid. Only complaint is no overhead grab bars. For those who think GM can?t make a car, please go out and drive one.",1
776,"This is my second Lexus, and have owned several cars previously. This is probably the best car I've ever purchased. The one flaw is the input control on the nav system, you have to stop the car. If it was a way to design the system so that if the passenger seat is occupied, the the passenger would be able to operate the system. just a thought, otherwise, very nice and enjoyable vehicle to drive.",1
777,"This car is a blast, love the six speed manual. Window snug up feature sticks in cold weather and can be a pain during frezing rain trying to warm up the vehicle as the interior gets wet. I test drove the BMW 3 convertible and was sold on the Eos due to the year round drivability and the difference of 12k in price for less features than the Eos. I got the iPod adaptor and 17 inch wheels, both worth the upgrade charge. Needs blue tooth capability and HD radio, cruise control is hard to see while driving making it hard to use. But I do love this car.",1
778,"Bought this vehicle while I was in Iraq through military buying program. Did research on these types of sites, and information was overwhelmingly positive, even though it was not rated well in Consumer Report. I took a bit of a ""plunge"" and bought it strictly on consumer ratings, vehicle magazine ratings (other than CR), and people such as you giving honest feedback on these sites. Got a great deal and bought a Sport 4x4, CVT transmission, electronic package. I have been driving it for a month now and it exceeds my expectations! I was concerned about a 4-cylinder engine, but more than enough power to get around. I heard some cons about the CVT, but not an issue...works very well.",1
779,"The ride is very smooth and quiet. For the price I paid I am very happy, I really like this little truck.",1
780,"I have had my tC since October, I did not even know that Scion even made this model. I was giving up on the new car search and I cam arcoss the tC. I love my car. Great speed, great cornering and nice look. The price was also wonderful. Thanks",1
781,"I have had them all. Audi, BMW 535, Infinity, Lincoln, MB E350. I couldn't believe the RL when I drove it somewhat reluctantly. Incredible road hugging and plenty of power with 300 hp for a v6. You can punish this car and it keeps coming back for more. I almost went for the Lexus GS 350 but felt it was rough riding and a little noisy compared to the RL. The GS 460 would have been more fun but much more expensive. Great technology and maybe the best GPS and Bose stereo with noise abatement. Cabin is whisper quiet. I got 26 mpg on 160 mile highway trip. Not bad. Fit and finish among the best. I will enjoy this car for 36 month lease, I know.",1
782,"Everything I expected, gets more comfortable with use. Fun to drive, lots of toys (nav) or just ""think"" in a quiet, smooth ride. Sporty to drive and comfortable on long drives.",1
783,"This is my first Mitsubishi...and I love the way it rides and handles. The 160 HP 4-cylinder engine is very peppy. I bought it instead of the ""6"" for better fuel economy. I'm getting about 22 - 23 MPG in mostly city driving. It is very roomy inside. The back seat has a lot of leg room. It has air bags everywhere. Plus it has a 5 star front and side impact rating from the government. I like that. Try it, you'll like it.",1
784,"I've owned this car for 6 months and it is great, I am very impressed. I've owned foreign and domestic cars and this is the best by far. I averaged 25.8 MPG mixed city and highway over 7000 miles. The controls are well thought out and the car is very comfortable. Test drive it and you will not be disappointed.",1
785,"I should preface by saying that I have only had the car for a few weeks, so perhaps the problems have not had time to make themselves apparent. But so far, this car is unbelievable for the price! The handling on the car is as good as foreign made cars (this is in fact my first American car and I can barely tell the difference). It's the perfect car for the city, and has more than enough pop for long highway drives. Interrior features are awesome, and it looks great from the outside with a spoiler.",1
786,I knew I had to have the XL7 as soon as my husband and I test drove it!! I love the room it has inside. The third row is so convenient. The storage is great and it rides really good. My daughter even loves it! Not too big and not too small. Perfect size for the three of us. Had no trouble out of it so far. I LOVE my XL7!,1
787,"I love this car! Plenty of power, great handling. Love the looks both inside and out. No problems, all maintenance has been very affordable, great dealer has been doing the maintenance for me. One flaw - very very very low quality plastics in the interior. The plastics scratch very very easily. In taking my laptop out of the passenger seat, it scratched the dash, also I've been putting my cell phone on the console near the power outlet and it too is scratched, just from being there. I'm hoping the company has a recall and they fix this - until then, it's the biggest bummer on such a FUN FUN FUN car!",1
788,Had a terrible accident but I was able to walk away from it thanks to the Enclave! It took the brunt of the damage and it was totaled. My insurance agent was amazed that I survived due to the condition of the outside of the vehicle. I'm going to purchase an '09 for a replacement.,1
789,"We just bought our Equinox a day before going on vacation. We put over 3000 miles in 12 days. Drove from Houston Tx to Michigan then to Niagra Falls and then down thru Penn, Tenn, Vir, W. Vir, Miss, Al, LA and back to Texas. MPG was great! Averaged at 26mpg. Ride was not a Cadillac but comfortable. All in all this is a great SUV.",1
790,If you love the feel of the road then you will love this series of Lexus because due to the stiff suspension you will feel every bump in the road. If you are broad in the beam get a different car. When I drove the car I had to shift my position numerous times to feel comfortable - the seat is not wide enough for a larger than average person. There is a wind noise on both sides of the windshield that should never be heard from a car in this price range - and owners of the same style Camry have reported the same noise as well but Toyota/Lexus report that this is normal. If you are long waisted (short legged) get a different car - it is impossible to adjust the height for comfort.,1
791,"The car looks great and has a fantastic ride, The kids love the dual dvd's and the satelite radio is easy to use for us. The ride is smooth and it handles very well.",1
792,"I purchased the GV for my wife due to the ever rising gas prices and let me be the first to say ""We are impressed!"" . I never thought I would ever own a Suzuki, but this mid sized SUV has it all. Now if you are looking for V8 power, buy a V8 but the 2.7L V6 has enough power to get ya' down the road. The GV is loaded with extras that most others charge for! We are getting 17/19mpg in the city and we have not taken a road trip yet. I'll report on that later. Can't complain about the handeling or size I am 6' and I have no trouble getting in or outof the GV. Heck, Just go test drive one and see for yourself. The car sold itself!",1
793,"Just bought this car for gas mileage. Went with the more stylish S. Bought the 5M to make it more interesting to drive. Not going to dazzle your socks off but is going to be a very able performer. Comfortable for the daily commute. Has enough creature comforts to stave off the want of a higher end vehicle. Love the gas mileage, only having to fill up every two weeks. Toyota Loyalist.",1
794,"My first week with A5 reveals it's a well-made car. Exterior design appears even much more beautiful in real life than the pictures. Walter de Silva (designer) was right when he says A5 is his best design. Interior design is peerless, controls perfect and intuitive, fit and finish defines fit and finish. Audi design doing in the auto world what Apple computers did in the computer world. Performance of the V-6 is not as robust as the BMW 335i coupe, which was the other car to choose from. However, A5 is powerful enough for everything besides drag- racing.",1
795,"100 miles/day and the car is great. Comfortable, but the S needs a center arm rest. Very smooth ride and handles very well. Most interior room of any small car we tested (Yaris, Elantra, Cobalt, Mazda3, Corolla). I'm 6'2"" and leg room was very important. This is a great buy for your money. 32 MPG when I drive reasonably, 29 MPG when I keep up with Chicago traffic at 80 MPH.",1
796,"This car is hands down the classiest looking large crossover/suv on the market. Fully loaded with the 7 passenger seating this car is nicer than a Mercedes GL or R Class. I never thought I'd buy a Buick, but after istting in this car and test driving it, we knew we had found a winner. GM's 100K mile warranty makes ownership hassle free. Other reviewers have mentioned it, the car would benefit from more power, but then again, gas isn't going back to $2/gallon anytime soon, and for around town there's plenty of power. How many people are going to drag race with this car anyway. Second row bucket seats make 3rd row access easier, and really make this a hands down winner it its class!",1
797,"After driving higher-end, foreign vehicles for the past 12 years, I decided to give an American-made car a try. Before I decided on the Saturn Aura, I already tested a Saab 9-3, Mercedes C, Audi A4 and Lexus IS250. The Aura was roomier, quieter, more comfortable and almost as nimble as these much higher priced cars. It's fresh exterior has piqued the interest of many fellow motorists, who have stopped me in parking lots and at the car wash. To a person, folks were very impressed and even more so, when I told them the cost of my XR which is equipped with every available option Saturn offers.My other vehicle is a pricey foreign make yet I get as much a kick from the Aura as I do from it.",1
798,"I've owned my '08 Altima for almost 5 months now and am extremely pleased. There have been absolutely no glitches. MPG range from 32-36, with 50/50 city highway driving. I notice my wife has some difficulty keeping it in EV mode as often as I do. It does take a little practice and experience anticipating hills, stops, etc. But the thing can really move on command! Great having a car that gets over 600 miles on a tank. I've gotten many positive comments about its sleek styling. Nothing negative to offer.",1
799,"Just got the Sequoia last weekend and I'm wondering why it took us so long to find the perfect family SUV. We had an 03 Expedition that was acting up. Figure we'd give Toyota a try since big Ford has let us down on what was suppose to be our 10 year SUV. For being a full size SUV, this machine drives like a car. Suspension is much nicer and acceleration is super smooth. I never thought I'd ever switch to a Japanese SUV for fear that it's not roomy enough for my family but I'm sure glad now. Definitely made the right decision. The design is well thought out for families that need to drive 3 kids in car seats. Love the fact that the 2nd row slides forward for easier access to 3rd row.",1
800,"This little car is more than what I expected for the cost. I would have to say it moves nicely and does not have any issues getting around for a little 2.0 liter. I am happy to lower my payments as this is a great car for the money, I would choose it over a Honda civic any day of the week. Our other car is a 06? Honda Accord and the Focus is quieter than my fully loaded V6 Accord. The interior is clean and well thought out as the controls with the satellite radio and sync take a little getting used to. I will have to say that ?The Sync is far superior to the i-control of the BMW 5 series and the Honda Accord that I own.? This is a gas saver and a great commuter car and garage others",1
801,"when I first saw the car , I was impressed by the beautiful exterior design. I got mine with the front under spoiler and fog lights and it looks very aggressive. I also got the interior panel trim which makes a big difference over stock. The car is lots of fun to drive. My only complaint is that it needs more power. In order to get those 197 horses you need to push the engine over 7000 rpm, which I think it's not healthy for the engine. In conclusion it's a great buy just needs more power. Turbo or supercharger will be nice.",1
802,"Every imaginable gadget, great looks, great ride, it did not disappoint. Got just under 32 MPG driving to work today (25 miles in stop and go traffic). The car is great, if you could just actually order one with what you want in it, that would be big.",1
803,"I was interested in AWD, coming from a Benz SUV, and looked at Audi, Acura, Infinity, Lexus, Mercedes, and Cadillac. The 535xi was simply the best car that I drove. It also was the most expensive of the group that I tested. In fact, like others have said, it is the best car that I have ever driven! The technology is not intrusive, it is helpful and with a little practice and reading the manuals, the navigation system and communication systems are your best friends. The fit and finish of the interior is impressive. The combination of pure driving capability, speed when needed, technology, and creature comforts in the cabin, made me covet the car.",1
804,I do like my Vibe. Not a lot of power and some road noise. I do get get very good mileage and the car is pleasant to drive. I average 34 mpg on the highway with an automatic.,1
805,"I finally got my FJ and it has been all I expected and more, very civilized ride and comfort, yet ruggedly constructed, and all this for under $30k, I love it!",1
806,"I get raves from a lot of other drivers and what a blast to drive this V50 is. Fort Knox on wheels too as Volvo is famous for safety. The Japanese made tranny matched to the 218 ponies makes it a dream to drive. Easy to be at 80+ mph and feels like 40. Quick on acceleration, shoots from the gate and leaves a lot of other cars in the dust! I say Volvo finally got it right in styling, interior, safety, guts, all there! I upgraded wheels to 17"", tinted all windows and this baby stands out on the road.",1
807,"My Acadia drives wonderfully, better than the other 2 SUVs I have owned. I love the body style the the fule mileage is great for the size of the SUV",1
808,"I sold my Prius to take advantage of the ca hov sticker value. Bought the versa as a ""bridge"" car until the electric hybrid comes along (hopefully). Am not disappointed. Am getting about 30 mpg combined, which is good as I drive a lot of country and hilly roads. Quiet ride. Love that the seats go flat for hauling items. Got it loaded for under 12,000. Did well in the high mountains on a recent road trip - enough power to feel confident on a crowded freeway. BASIC interior inoffensive. Negatives - need more storage spaces in front and cup holders are cramped. Radio is difficult to tune to new stations. That's about it. Wish it got 45 mpg... Ah, well.",1
809,"Had owned a 2002 Mazda Protege ES. That car was such a well controlled handler, but was starting to get too punishing on midwestern roads hammered by a hard winter. The 08 Mazda6 is almost as fun to whip around as the Protege, but a much easier car to live with - better balance between fun and comfort. But of course handling still beats the pants off an Accord or (yawn) Camry! Size was just-right for me, and comfy enough in back that I don't feel guilty putting passengers back there like I used to.",1
810,"Handling is awesome. Power is incredible. I tried the DS mode and the steptronic and car left in a hurry. Fuel economy so far is about 24 MPG 75%/25% highway/city. Seems to do badly in stop and go traffic. Test drove a C300, IS250, and C230. BMW was far superior in all categories.",1
811,"Being my first SUV, I've tried quite a few out; the Rav-4, the CR-V, Ford Escape, and little did I know the 2008 Vue was available. Upon going to the dealership, my fiancee and I took a test drive and we were sold. The vehicle looks much like a higher-class SUV rather than the cheaper 2007 model. The drive is great, comfortable, and extremely enjoyable. I've been pleasantly surprised by the drive and quality of this car, and everywhere you look, there's something new you discover about it. I'd easily recommend this to friends and family.",1
812,"Amazing handling and comfort for a large SUV. The design is very sharp with the 20"" wheels. Get comments on it regularly. The navigation system, stereo, etc are top of the line. Nice twist on the back up camera. All that while hauling three kids in car seats, 2 dogs and a 5,000lb boat. Very nice looking, functional and solid vehicle.",1
813,I owned my 2007 Mazdaspeed 3 GT for a total of 45 minutes before I was in a head on collision by a RAV-4 going eastbound on a westbound lane on a major highway. We were both going approximately 65 MPH in opposite directions before we collided. I cannot comment on the long term reliability of the vehicle or the MPG but I am alive today due to the solid construction and safety features of this vehicle. Unfortunately the person driving the RAV-4 that hit me was not as lucky. My hat is off to Mazda for building such a fantastic and secure vehicle.,1
814,"I love this car. It drives smooth, is amazing on ice and snow and is just as nice to look at as the Acura everyone else seems to own here in Alaska. I was surprised at how quick it accelerates and it purrs at 70 to 75 mph. The Bluetooth is a feature that I will never live without. For the $ I paid ($24K) I feel like I got the best car for the money. I smile every time I drive it. Dealership support also has been fantastic.",1
815,"I have has a Pontiac for the past 12 years. I absolutely love my LaCrosse. Just a few enhancements that would make it even better! I think the passenger seat should be electric, just as the drivers seat is. Climate control vents in the rear would alson be a great feature as well. I know I make my right buying decision with the Buick. Thanks GM",1
816,"Great vehicle. Researched Ford Escape and all other small SUV's and the Patriot is the best value even if gas goes up to $5 a gallon. No need for you to repeat my research. Been getting about 21.5 mpg on the first tank mostly city driving though. Sharp vehicle, with really great handling, I can get it into tight spaces. Have your cake and eat it to with this SUV. Can't wait to see how it will perform in the snow.",1
817,"You may as well buy this one!!! Don't let some of the magazine reviews turn you away from buying this gorgeous vehicle. I mean, let's face it, is there a halfway decent car out there that has room for the whole family AND gets good gas mileage. The simple answer is NO. My 2008 Sequoia is a smooth smooth ride, and mine spends its time on Boston roads, which are some of the worst pothole infested roads in the country. Some reviews say that the steering is too easy, and coming from a 4runner I can see what they are saying, but if the Sequoia had a Lexus badge they would be complementing its effortless steering instead of trying do equate it to a Chevy Silverado.",1
818,"For the money you can not beat it. 4wd, very good mpg plenty of room. Looks pretty good too.",1
819,"This is my first Toyota and what a wonderful experience. I am a 48 year old grandmother who still needs a little fun in her life. This vehicle fits the bill of not too large and not too small. Perfect for taking my children to college, loading groceries and simply a blast to drive. Would highly recommend this car-based vehicle to everyone. Past loves have been Expeditions, minivans and a sport car. Best value and so much more. I appreciate the car more each day. Even my honda loving husband of 24 years enjoys driving it! I love the stares when I drive it!!",1
820,"Traded in a Ford Explorer XLT due to gas mileage. I am a piano technician and have to carry tools at all times. This was a great choice after searching for 3 months. Compared American, Japanese and Korean cars. I wanted the Prius, but there were none to be had, and then dealers were selling for ""market price"". I made a great choice for me. I am 6'3"" and above 250 lbs. Comfort is there for leg room, but to me, seat surfaces are not soft enough. That being my only complaint of the inside, everything else is great. I love the stereo-great sound and flexibility; cd changer, ipod & xm to Aux input is fabulous. Easy to work. Car well laid out. Easy to read instruments.",1
821,"Surprised at the fit and finish of an American assembled MB. Quite a departure from my '98 ML320 that my mechanic often cursed 'this is not a Mercedes!' Why choose the GL450/550 when 1) gas version comes at a $2500 premium over the diesel (not the case usually with diesel vehicles) 2) gas version requires premium unleaded fuel (premium still costs more than diesel) 3) the diesel gets 18/24 gas gets 13/18 ( GL550 will fare worse); average economy for both cars at 12k miles/year and factoring price differences for premium vs. diesel you'd save ~$600/yr in fuel savings on top of the $2500; Not noisy, not slow, no smoke or smell; 0-60 who cares?? it's an SUV",1
822,"My decision was between a Mercedes S550 4 matic sport and the Audi S8. The S550 is nice, but the S8 just felt like something more special. The v10 engine (smooth and quiet at normal speeds, and unbelievably poweful and ""baritone"" when you want it to be), and the special ""S"" interior and exterior felt like something a step above the norm. Even the ride (with the std 20 inch rims) is wonderful in comfort mode... unbelievable given the potholes in my part of the country). I average about 15.5 mpg (70% city/30% highway). Not great, but hey, that v10 power/noise has got to come from somewhere. Net, no regrets so far.",1
823,"I just got my new Olive Mist 4dr Yaris. I just got to 200 miles and have no complaints, it is the cutest thing, people think it's a Volkswagen. Since having this I wouldn't trade it for anything; it has great pickup and turning corners is a blast. I like the cupholders where they are, it's kinda different. Gas is also GREAT, like I said, made it to 200 miles and still have over half a tank left! Get one!",1
824,"I love my 2008 Nissan Rogue. It is my first ""grown up"" car, and I have thoroughly enjoyed having it. My husband and I are both over 6' tall, and we both fit comfortably in the front seats. The interior and exterior are very well-designed (this opinion is coming from a professional product designer). Nissan really did a great job of including a number of convenient features in the Rogue (i.e., a deep glove compartment, nice cup holders, an auxiliary plug, pen holders, insurance card holders, etc.). The Rogue comes with great safety features such as side curtain air bags and a tire air pressure monitor. These are great features that come standard on the base model Rogue S.",1
825,"So far I owned brand new, a 1996 ram, 2001ram, 2006ram, and now 2008 ram big horn. By far the best truck on the road. Comfortable ride, as well as nice and quiet. Has the MDS system in it which saves gas, although it can use it when you lay on it for the fun. The big Hemi 345 hp engine is great. I am really pleased with this big bad boy of a truck. And very tough to. As well as being great in winter weather. 4x4 is a plus. Works great and has a lifetime powertrain warranty.Seating is confy, but can be tight in the back for long legs. Otherwise, there is no other truck you can add to that makes this beast sound like it does.",1
826,I love my new VUE. I purchased it to get better gas mileage. I was driving a 03 Explorer that was getting 12mpg and with my VUE I am getting 22-25mpg and with the gas prices going so high I need it. It is a fun car to drive and it is very sharp looking. I love driving it.,1
827,"I have owned 2 Fords, 4 Chevys and a Toyota and this is the best truck I have owned to date. It is stupid fast and shifts smooth as butter. Mileage is about 15 in the city. My only compaint would be it is a little hard to get into and rides a little on the stiff side for a 1/2 ton. Brakes, comfort, tranny, motor and initial quality is near perfect!",1
828,"Very pleased with all aspects of this car. Gas mileage exceeded our expectations, getting 25.5 mpg on a recent 600 mile trip. We got just under 28 mpg on the way back. So far we seem to be averaging 20 mpg around town. Kids love the room and the third row seat. Great ride, quiet and comfortable. We're glad this vehicle came with the back up camera without having to get the nav. system. We looked for a long time and at lots of different cars, this easily was the best car for us.",1
829,"After having several new Toyotas of all sizes, the Yaris 2D Hatch is the most fun to drive. I road tested the competitors and none handled as well, or were rated as high in mileage. This car rides very comfortably and the small turning circle makes it a real pleasure to manuver around in town. I've had mine 6 weeks and average 36 mpg in city only driving. A 300 mile trip on the freeway returned 42 mpg @ 70mph. The interior is very well thought out with lots of cup holders, 3 gloveboxes, & many small storage areas. Mine has the sport seats which have high grade material and are very supportive & comfortable. I could not be happier with my new 2008 Yaris.",1
830,"Performance: The CVT engine is awesome. Its very smooth. You wont even feel it shift. For a 4 cylinder car, it has great acceleration and enough passing power for everyday driving needs. Comfort: pretty good. Nice solid seats. Fuel economy: not sure yet, since I only have 150 miles on it. I've driven 150 miles so far, and I have between 3/4 and 1/2 tanks left. Awesome! Fun to drive: goes with performance and comfort. Tight steering, I like it. Interior design: nice dash, very intuitive, tons of storage. Exterior design: nice look, somewhat sporty. Very large inside compared to what it looks like. Build quality: seems good. Still a new car right now. Reliability: same as build quality.",1
831,"Runs great, has really amazing pickup and go, I really like the improvement in the tranny's more than anything because our `98 Grandcaravan that we traded in, it's tranny was garbage even though it was a 4-speed but the new 6-speed is awesome. Overall, I completely satisfied with this van.",1
832,"I finally own my dream vehicle. This RDX is beautiful. I picked the carbon bronze because not too many vehicles on the road are that color. The AWD is superb for handling in any situation. The turbocharged engine is very good for performance in passing and acceleration, better than some V6s. The interior is very comfortable with the adjustable driver seat and roomy enough second row. The satellite radio, 360-watt stereo system, dual climate, digital read-outs, and memory seats are all awesome for standard equipment. The fuel economy is respectable and premium gas is not a problem. This crossover is a 10 all the way around. Thanks Acura for another innovative, top-of-the-line vehicle.",1
833,"I really love my Yaris. I had to replace 97 Chavlier and went looking for a truck and bought a 2 door, (3 if you count the hatch), small car. I like the way you can get into the car without feeling you about to sit in a well. I'm only 5 even and that was one selling point is that I could get in and out without fighting gravity. The dealer thought I was crazy when I said that the Yaris had a small ""growl"" like a Mustang I test droved. I didn't realize till two days later that I had it in Drive 3. Duh.",1
834,"I had a choice between going with 07 SEL w/ leather & spoiler and a 08 SE for the same price. I went with the 08 SE since it had better safety ratings. The car is beautiful on the outside and inside. The only few points off is: 1) the plastic inside look somewhat cheap, especially noticeable at the fan grilles. 2) the phone bluetooth button does not work without sync, which I did not know otherwise I would have bought a model with sync. (I never asked) The maintenance is nice, oil schedule is every 7500 which is a plus from every 3000 miles that I'm used to. The car handles and rides very smoothly. It's power output is definitely better than our other 4cyl Saturn.",1
835,This is a beautiful car! My husband bought it for me as a gift but I think he really bought it for himself as he cannot stop raving about it. I chose the bluestone color which clearly was worth the wait. Can't wait until the weather warms up so I can really have some fun!,1
836,"Was back and forth between Acura TL-S and Infiniti G35 and am so glad I went Infiniti. So much power, love the rear wheel drive, features galore and probably got a better deal than I would have on an Acura. Navigation is great, real time XM traffic will change the way you drive and the built in hard drive is a killer feature. The new styling and revamped interior really make the G35 standout among the competition. It's also nice to pull up next to Audi A4 owners and blow them off the line! Such a fun car, I still can't wait to get in and take off every day.",1
837,"This was an upgrade from a 95 Dodge Neon, so it didn't take much to make me happy. Very happy driving my new car!",1
838,"This is my 3rd 3-series (2002 325i, 2006 325i, now my 2008 328i Coupe) and I can say that I have been a loyal, dedicated customer of BMW. The cars are so wonderful once you buy one you can't buy or drive any other make. It feels like a part of you physically as you drive the car, from the structure to the brakes to the steering and engine the feeling is so terrific and reassuring other makes feel like appliances in comparison or clouds to drive (i.e. Lexus). BMW sure has created a car worthy of master craftsmanship that will have longevity in the marketplace for years to come if they keep up the wonderful effort in producing such a wonderful product!",1
839,"I really like this car. I have a 2005 Elantra and I am amazed at the differences. Both are excellent autos, but I really like the classy feel to my new 2008. She gets great gas mileage, good on the roads, and just overall a very comfortable car.",1
840,"Big interior, trunk. Good handling, very quiet on hwy. Good mileage. Fit and finish above average. I am 6,4"" and weigh 260 lbs and I have ample room.",1
841,"I have owned this just about a month, and can't believe how much money I have already saved! Can't beat it, Great MPG: 38 hiway, 33 city so far, great trunk space than orginally thought, enough pep, seats are more comfortable..and I got the manual which I had not driven in over 20 years, and was very comfortable. I would recommend this as a good value for the money. Looked at Astra, but would have spent extra 4k. Only con, maybe more nooks and crannies, for little things i.e coins, sunglasses, etc. Other than that very, very happy with this purchase. And even enough back seat room in 4dr sedan!",1
842,"I like the car overall. I was driving a 1995 Avalon, so replacing my car is a big deal. Going from a V6 to a V4 takes some getting used to. I think the overdrive gear is too low. On cruise control over a minor hill, the car downshifts (my Avalon NEVER did that.) I think they put a low gear for more fuel economy, but I would sure like an override to the constant down shifting. The car is a real head turner, I love the styling. The controls are neatly placed. The audio system has a jack for my portable tape player. I wish the audio system had both CD and cassette. Also, I am pleased that the car warms up fast in the morning (how did they do that?)",1
843,"This car is awesome! I never thought I would own a Hyundai and was persuaded to test drive this by my girlfriend and am soooo glad I did. I love the styling, comfort, value and incredibly smooth ride. I test drove just about every small SUV and this was the clear winner!",1
844,"I have been a Chevy man for years, an I love old car, and then when I read this was the last year of the PT Cruiser I knew I had to have one. I love the way this car looks I love the way it drives. I just love this car.",1
845,"This car is fun, fun, fun! I have only had it a week and I can't remember loving any car this much. After purchasing my new Eos I left the dealer with the top down (of course!). I only got about five miles before some guy drove up and yelled, ""Nice car!"" to me. My daughter is seriously impressed and she has a new BMW 3 series!",1
846,The driving experience has been wonderful. The vehicle holds to the road and basically drives itself. The sensors are an added feature that certainly gives a peace of mind related to safety.,1
847,"The new G35 is solid ride and very well built. I'm replacing a 2005 Acura TL which was a rattling piece of junk. There is a world of difference and not for much more money. The style exterior and interior is great much better than the previous G35. It's very, very fast and fun to drive. If you want one of these cars, get at least the premium and tech packages and the wood package is neat also. The seats are stiff and fairly average size - not made for a large person! It's simply a great value for the money and hopefully be great quality and a great alternative to Acura who I feel is slipping in quality.",1
848,"I've heard a lot of negative comments about previous year models, but I've had no problems with my Equinox. It's roomy, but not to big to manuever. Back seat is great. Great options and decent gas mileage.",1
849,"I purchased the car 4/11/08 and have almost 7000 miles on it already. The power is great (for a hybrid). So far I wish for a bigger trunk, but I knew that before I purchased it. Braking is top notch and I have never needed more power in passing or on hills. I drive mainly freeway to work and road trips. My gas mileage has been 30-32 mpg avg. I have seen as high as 37 mpg but like I said I drive pretty fast. I average 75-90 on the freeway. The car is very solid at all speeds but does very poorly up to speed with wind.",1
850,"I bought the Nitro on a whim, but have had no regrets ever since. I've had no Major problems with the truck. The only issues i've had is i wish chrysler put a manual lumber support in the drivers seat. Now the truck is 2 years old, i to have a rattle on my dash somewhere, minnor issues with the remote and the overdrive is acting up, activates at 45 and bogs the motor down less you speed up to over 50 or drop down yo 40 mph (chrysler knows about it), so dont hesitate to complain to your dealer or even chrysler about the issue, before your warranty runs out. Having said all that, I still luv my truck even after 2 years and I've gotten more compliments out of the nitro then any I've had.......",1
851,"We also looked at MDX, CX-9 and Veracruz. Nothing compares to Enclave. We were attracted to the stylish exterior initially but we were surprised to see how good the build quality was. This is the best bargain in the market if you are looking to get a quality SUV/CUV. We have the White Diamond which they no longer produce. Worth a 12 weeks wait.",1
852,"Car is so quiet and smooth. Luv the bigger V-6, almost unnoticeable when it shifts. SE has very nice interior. Very comfortable. Great mileage...21 local...24 highway. Better mileage than 2003 which had small V-6. Had 2003 Santa Fe 5 years..enjoyed it so much there was no question when we went to look for a new car. No mechanical probs on the 2003 & after I'd wash it it looked like new car even after 5 years. When u consider the price & warranty, my 2008 Santa Fee is a ""no-brainer""!",1
853,"Just got it, but is incredibly fun to drive, and the price is right. Where else can you get a fully loaded ""sport"" model at this price point. Only thing is in this area, their is about an eight week waiting list to purchase one. I had to travel an hour and an half round trip to pick one up.",1
854,I love my rabbit. It sold itself to me on the test drive. No other car came close to that. I hit 95 mph without even noticing. Could be trouble but it's a smooth ride I haven't found a single thing to complain about yet. Only 23 mpg on first tank of gas though with lots of highway driving. I think I'm just being heavy on the gas though.,1
855,"I've only had this truck for about three weeks, but I'm so glad I bought it. This is my first Toyota and after driving it I'm sure it won't be my last. I've been a loyal Dodge fan for nearly 20 years, but the Tundra beats it hands down. It has more room, a much better ride, more power, more standard features... simply more. I loved the look of my '02 Ram and still think the '02 through '05 models are the best looking trucks on the road. The current styling and lack of options are what made me look at the Tundra. I am sure glad I did. It was by far the best choice I've made on a vehicle for a long time. I couldn't be happier with this truck.",1
856,Traded in a 06 Honda pilot. Now I have an RX 350 AWD the ride is a lot more like a car's. It's got the power to take off in a green light.,1
857,"I bought this vehicle with 20,000 miles on it. As a person finishing up college, I was looking for something reliable and affordable yet still stilish and interesting. Fuel consumption is amazing- I took a 300 mile trip at around 75 mph speeds and used only 1/2 tank of gas. I look for any reason to drive this car! The 4 cylinder engine isn't dissappointing- it delivers adequate acceleration and plenty of power for me. The speakers are great, love the light grey interior, and although the seats are a little uncomfortably firm, I am adjusting. This isn't a luxury car but it's reasonably priced, gets a ton of compliments, and is a pleasure to operate, plus the fuel economy is great.",1
858,"After many Mercedes I believe that this is the best overall package. A great overall balance of ride, handling and luxury. Many people comment on the lack of leather upolstery as standard, but my experience with the MB Tex has been much better durability and appearance after several years of use. I would recommend the P2 package. You will really appreciate the visibility afforded by the Bi-Xenon headlamps. Once you have purchased Mercedes no other vehicle will do.",1
859,"This is my first diesel and I am absolutely amazed at the quick response in acceleration. I've only put 1600 miles on it but average 15 mpg around town and just over 17 hwy. The interior is absolutely great. Instruments are easy to read and with the steering wheel controls, don't have to look around to do most of the common things done while driving (cruise control, radio station, volume). The dash information center is great, mileage avgerage, distance to go before refill. The added feature of integrated brake control for trailering is fantastic. The 180 degree rear doors are really great when loading goods or people in the back seat. Diesel is very quiet. You can actually talk while driving.",1
860,"Drove it on the Autobahn after European delivery in Munich all the way to Vienna - awesome power, handling and comfort. Navigation and heads up display took me right to my Vienna hotel. Car is great fun to drive and a real head turner - would strongly recommend 3/4 hours with the iDrive manual in order to fully appreciate it, particularly if used in conjunction with the steering wheel controls. Trunk handles two golf bags and rear seat is definitely functional. Heads up display and sports package a must as is upgraded stereo system. Very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this vehicle and also the European Delivery program - BMW does it right.",1
861,For $48k it should come with a bigger engine. It'll go when pushed but it lags at first. Car handles like it were glued to the road while providing a level of comfort you would expect in a luxury car.,1
862,I love this SUV. Had a 2004 Denali and for the price its as good or better. Same features and at $15000 lower price. Can't be telling this but Hemi is the kicker.,1
863,My last vehicles where Toyotas and a Chevy Suburban. My Toyota is still going strong but my Suburban is falling apart. I told my wife I'll never buy American but when she told me about the Enclave I went myself and test drove the car. Amazing look and comfort so I purchased one that same day and surprised my wife. Everywhere we go we get stopped and they ask what kind a car this is.,1
864,"The absolute best truck on the market! Had my Sierra w/ All Terrain package for three weeks and at just under 3k miles, I couldn't be happier. Rides like a luxury car on the highway and an off-roader when needed. All Terrain package runs just under Denali as far as price but maintains more of the off- roader feel. Z71 package w/ 20"" chrome wheels, 5.3 liter V8, 2-tone leather seating, & much more. I am getting 20 to 21 mpg on hwy & 17 city! Not bad for a larger V8 that really isn't meant for fuel effiency. Overall, best truck on the market after extensive checking and I couldn't be happier. If you are looking for a real deal with a great feel do not stop short of at least drinving one!",1
865,"I read dozens of reviews on this site before I bought my very own Yaris just 6 hours ago! What an awesome little car! I'm 6' 2"" and 262 pounds and this car has plenty of room for me. The A/C will freeze you to death, the fuel efficient engine has more than enough zip to make driving fun again. It looks great, drives great, handles great, and I love it. Mine has factory cruise control, so it is available for the hatchback. I love this car :)",1
866,"We made up our minds to get another Toyota, this time the Highlander. Love it. Not too big, not too small, it's just right. It handles smoothly and I have the feeling of security in it. Would suggest this auto to anyone who is looking for safety, height of 4 wheeler, and ride of Lexus. Very comfortable, love it, love it, love it. Can't go wrong buying this one. Well worth it. No negatives on this car.",1
867,"Before buying my 2008 Sport Hardtop 5-speed, my main concerns were riding comfort and gas mileage. After experiencing my first long trip (5905 mi), both concerns are gone! Ride is firm, but comfortable, with exception of older concrete surfaces that can produce fairly harsh jitters. Driver seat is very supportive, especially the back. Overall ride is very good, not great, and very quiet for a convertible. If you're not a lead foot, you can get very good gas mileage. I've gotten 32.5 mpg in/around town, and 35.6 mpg total over the long trip above (as high as almost 42 mpg in slower mountain driving, and low of 33 mpg at sustained highway speeds of 70/75 mph. (All mileages calculated.)",1
868,Before I purchased my Susuki I drove a Lexus RX300. I could not afford to buy another Lexus but wanted all the bells and whistles of my Lexus. I would never thought to have even test drove a Susuki but when I did I was hooked. I knew that I was going to purchase the car. I have two kids and love the 3rd row seating. The storage is great. It has a lot of pep and my husband likes the duel exhaust. I really like the interior. I love the red and white lights. I actually like the window switches in the middle console. I know some people in other reviews did not like that...to each their own. I would at least recommend someone to test drive the Susuki XL7 before making a final purchase.,1
869,"Replaced 1999 Taurus with NAH as primarily a commuter car. 22 miles each way 50-50 split highway/city. During the summer enjoyed 37-39 mpg, but when it got cold - mileage crashed to 30-32 mpg. Have Convenience package - Tech package too much money and what I wanted was the power seat any way. Great seat comfort on long drives; but even though I knew it, the trunk size can be painful. Did not expect car to be conversation piece - many people commenting on a hybrid that is not small or looks like a car. Even Prius owners have admired the car. I love the fact that for a comparable sized car I am using 4 to 6 less gallons a week!",1
870,"This vehicle is adding years to my life. I'm comfortable and stress free in traffic. Love how quiet the ride is, the DVD system is great for the kids, great heat, tons of room, very safe on ice or in poor winter driving conditions, visibility good in front and lights are perfect for highway driving. Fuel mileage not what the old Corolla used to get, but what do you really want? You're driving something much bigger. Had to have the radio replaced at 8 000 k but no problems otherwise. Noticed a bit of a rattle in the front sunroof after 10,000k.",1
871,"I two a 10,000 lb trailer on a regular basis. My previous truck was a Ford with a 460 V8. The Tundra 5.7 bets it hands down in power and economy. I have never owned a p/u in my 35 years of driving that is as powerful as this one. It is amazing. I regularly get 20 mpg driving 55 mpg empty highway miles. Around town is 14 mpg and pulling a loaded trailer at 55 mpg gets me 14 mpg. I use regular gas and everything factory.",1
872,"Drove Silverados for ten years. Last new was a 1998 with 128,000 plus miles combination city and highway. Was in excellent shape when I gave it to my daughter and bought the Double Cab SR5 with big V8. Tundra handled a lot tighter than Ford or Chevrolet with less effort. Ride is smooth on and off road. Comfortable in front seats and back according to my 6'4"" son-in law. Still in break in period with 1500 miles on it. Driving 70 to 75 MPH with air conditioner on and cruise set I average 19.8 MPG highway and city is 15.3 with air conditioner on. I do avoid stop and go traffic as much as possible which has helped the gas mileage a lot. Better gas mileage than my 1998 Silverado.",1
873,"I traded a '07 Corvette - fully loaded, it was a great American car, but no comparison to my new SL 550. Performance, handling, quality interior and exterior are beyond my expectations. I have had many MB automobiles since my first 1988, this is by far the best.",1
874,"I just traded my 05 Tib on this SE model and I very happy with it. Looks, drive, and reasonable fuel mileage add up to a great ride.",1
875,"Just an update after owning the Entourage SE for 6 months now. The only problem that we are having is that the check engine light comes on periodicaly. The owners manual says to check the tightness of the gas cap. So when it comes on, usually at about a half tank, I get out and unscrew the cap and retighten. Then by the next morning, the lights off. Some day I'll get my butt in gear and get it to the dealer. But other than that, the van has been nothing but fantastic. The kids love the DVD and the fact that the windows on the sliding doors go up and down. The wife loves the heated seats now that winter is coming and I love the horse power and smooth ride and the back up warning sensor.",1
876,I bought a new LT Avalanche in 2006 and just now traded it in to a 2008. We just wanted the new design. We had no problems at all with our 2006. I love the way they drive and handle. I wish I had paid the difference and got the LTZ package. I love everything about it and hope this one is as good as my 2006.,1
877,I enjoy driving the Rondo but you feel every bump in the road and that is uncomfortable. The gas mileage is okay but I had hoped it would be better (don't we all?),1
878,"Love the car. Sexy style, fun to drive, hot sound system, what's not to like? If you are thinking about getting one just do it! I am 6 feet tall and there's enough room.",1
879,"I bought this car as a replacement to a 1993 Audi. I drive a lot and needed good fuel economy. I have almost 5000 miles on the car and my calculated mpg is 37.4. The headrests are uncomfortable from the factory (they tip my head forward), but they are easily reversed and quite comfortable when reversed. It is a little tight with 2 teenage boys in the back, but they can make it work. It handles well. It has good acceleration and cornering. I was a little afraid of the low rolling resistance tires, but they seem to perform well. The stereo is adequate, but lacks fidelity in the bass. I suggest the XFE version over the standard. Its performance seems about the same. Minor lines mismatch on hood",1
880,"I bought the absolutely red hatchback. I love the car. Great gas mileage, fun to drive. Everyone asks me if it's a hybrid. Great for city driving.",1
881,"I really like this car. I drove a similar, but smaller model in Spain and was thrilled to see that Nissan was putting out a subcompact in the USA. I was looking for a car that rode a little higher than the average sedan, but still got good gas mileage, and didn't cost too much. I got all those things in the Versa, and I haven't been disappointed in any of its quirks (e.g. audible shifting noises, loose handling, flimsy velcro attachment for the hatch cover). Plus, I love the upholstery (microfibery), the tire pressure monitoring system, the touch- sensitive hatch lifter, and the interior room with an adorable, easy to park exterior.",1
882,"I wasn't even looking for an Escape when I started shopping and ending up there on chance because the Toyota dealer messed me over and I walked out. Anyway, I was surprised by the performance, look and feel of the 2007 Escape. It has been a great ride over the past year. The only thing I have noticed is breaking really hard is a little sluggish but over all a great ride. I am very happy with my 2007 Escape.",1
883,"This is truly an amazing vehicle for the price - outstanding performance. The 2008 Rabbit handles better than my 528i BMW - you never feel like you are losing control. Tight going into and coming out of turns. And acceleration; this car responds. I'm 6' 1"" and fit comfortably. Controls are easy to reach and intuitive - well designed interior. Yes, it is very enjoyable to drive and exceeds my expectations for a car under $20k! When driving conservatively, the car averages around 27-28 MPG - highway gets 30 MPG easy.",1
884,"I love everything about my Civic, the styling, the fuel economy, the handling, the performance, and it is very quiet and comfortable for its size. Best of all is its quality, though. From the fit and finish to the feel of it's switches, this car oozes quality. Having driven Japanese cars for 20 years, I think I'm hard to impress, too. This is my first Honda, but it won't be my last.",1
885,Just purchased used hhr as second vehicle for the family. So far we are enjoying it. Have spent some money on performance upgrades and a set of wheels (had to get rid of those ugly hub caps) now my son doesn't call it lame looking any more. Could use some help in the interior though. Needs the center arm rests located a little higher so you can place a cup in the holder without having to raise the arm rest and it would also make it a little more comfortable. Please keep up the good work in the design of cool looking little economy cars. Not those lame looking hybribs (prius) that the competition makes.,1
886,"In 18000 miles now, I've been to the dealership 5 times, 4 for service, and once for a check engine light (put crappy gas in it), handles very well, a lot of fun in the rain/snow with traction controll off. Quick off the line. Not quite an STI in performance (heavier and less hp) but really comfortable and a lot nicer inside. Have no doubts about taking clients out in it.",1
887,"I love my Yaris. It has all the equipment I wanted in a new car, gets great gas mileage, it's a blast to drive and it's a freakin Toyota so I can rely on it for years and years to come. At first I was skeptical of the Yaris and never thought that I would own one. I kept thinking that I could never go back to a little car, especially coming out of a '95 Olds. sedan. But the more I complained about the gas mileage my tank of a car was getting, the more appealing the Yaris became. Not to mention the price point is just as attractive as the styling.",1
888,"Having have many performance German vehicles in the past (BMW E46 M3 was my last), there is no substitute for displacement. The torque on takeoff always puts a smile on my face. I love the NPP exhaust which I recommend to anyone as a must have. This car is a tremendous deal for the price that will spank many cars costing 2-3 times more. Also, to increase the HP to over 500 is relatively cheap compared to German or Italian cars.",1
889,"We wanted this car forever. Heard they were changing the body style so we waited another year!! Glad we did. The truck handles great. The traction control really works. I was making a turn onto a wet just paved street and the truck started to spin. The traction control kicked in and set the truck straight! That is the best feature they could have added to a truck this size. The only complaint is I only get 12.5 miles to the gallon. How long does it take for the fuel management system to kick in? I only have 800 miles on it, maybe someone can let me know. Also, we have black leather and light tan looking headliner which looks weird. Other than that we love it, drives so smooth, and quiet!",1
890,"The Fit is fantastic. I needed something fuel efficient, and something to transport dogs and bikes. I looked at other hatchbacks, new and used, and this seemed like the most bang for the buck, even brand new. I was in awe at the amount of interior space for such a tiny-looking car. With the back seats folded flat, I can fit 2 bikes, luggage, 2 dogs and 2 people! I can also fit both dogs in the back/hatchback area and 4 people in the car simultaneously. I have friends that borrow the Fit to move furniture (chairs, dressers) - something typically reserved for trucks, but the Fit can handle it!",1
891,"Would like more hp when accelerating to get onto freeway or pass another vehicle, vehicle is a little sluggish in that area. Fuel economy is o.k., 17 mpg city. Otherwise overall excellent ride so far.",1
892,"My round trip daily commute to work is 120 miles. I have found the Impala to be stylish and comfortable and affordable. Would like better fuel economy. By changing brands of gasoline, I have increased gas mileage from 21 to 24/25 mpg hwy. I have owned 2 Monte Carlos, 2001 LS and 2006 LT and miss them both. 119,000 and 88,000 respectively. The Impala LTZ and SS are as close as you will come to the soon to be extinct Monte Carlos. The OnStar feature was a selling point for me and the Impala LTZ is priced right--good buy.",1
893,"I had all the Vettes c 1-5 and and this one will make history. If you drive one you will buy one. A little hi tech for an everyday driver, but so far no problems.",1
894,"I really like this car. Quiet, comfortable, and cruises the highway exceedingly well. (Just 2000 RPM at 78 mph) Road noise is very low. Previously driven Chevy Impalas and this Taurus is clearly well above it in style, fit, and finish. I've been trying to stay with an American brand sedan. This car is definitely worth a look and a test drive. I ordered the SEL with leather option, and upgraded radio package.",1
895,"Surprise! Ford really means it when they say this car can beat the Camry and Accord. Don't take their word for it, give it a try. Eerily quiet, smooth, elegant interior with the leather package, smooth-shifting six- speed automatic, and decent fuel economy at 25 MPG in mixed driving with the V-6.",1
896,"We've had this for 3 days now. It's a very nice car/truck. My wife had a BMW 528i wagon, and was a little leery of trading 'down' to a GM. After a few days she's over that. It drives very nice. All passengers sit nice and high so there's great visibility. There's a nice feel of security in this vehicle. It drives like a car but has the road presence of a truck. And it feels like it's put together very well. Heated seats, mirrors, great stereo, parking assist... It's full featured and gives off a great confidence. GM is back with this one!",1
897,"Excellent car! I have owned Toyotas and VWs previously. The car will put that 'GRIN"" on your face every drive. Engine goes like stink and car handles all too good for this price. Being 6'3 and 265 I am comfortable always. Looked at the new 3 Series first, smaller interior space and less HP. Mild winter so far here in upstate NY, anxiously waiting to test AWD. When will this ""GRIN"" go away? Sound system also plays all music types with excellent quality. Tough decision between engine sound or music! GRIN",1
898,"535i Sapphire Black/Black with Sport & Premium. Simply awesome. Very well built, comfortable, fun to drive, quiet inside and bloody fast. Test drove an A6 3.2 Quattro and an E350 Sport. The Audi was really nice but felt a little underpowered (after driving the 535i). The E350 is a great passenger's car, not that great a driver's car.",1
899,"I have 90 mile daily commute, good mpg required, thus had to pass on any V6 SUV's. CR-V won't thrill with acceleration, but I routinely have 4 adults, a baby, and a load of Costco purchases aboard, and it handles hills and merges just fine. Nimble handling, good sight lines, excellent brakes. 2008 had several crazy snowstorms in Pacific NW. CR-V AWD handled quite well, although the stock Bridgestone tires not the greatest and at 32k are almost spent. Nary a squeak or rattle, except for a whistling sound from the A/C every so often. Rogue was a close second, having Bluetooth, Xenon, Bose, but also fixed rear seat and headrests, and a little less solid feeling.",1
900,"5000kms on my 08 Nitro R/T and if I given the choice I would do it again. Fuel economy improves with every tank, styling is unique in a sea of rolling eggs. Infinity stereo is awesome, slide and go storage is great. While cross shopping this vehicle I wound the imports to be thousands more for less performance. 2 thumbs up.",1
901,"I am really happy with my Compass (purchased 7/13/06). The name was a little hard to remember at first but since I starting calling her ""Compass Rose"" the name fits perfectly. Funny though the car is NOT equipped with a compass. I traded in my '99 Jeep Cherokee Classic so, needless to say the ride is smooth, merging into traffic is effortless even with the 2.7, 4 cylinder engine, and not remarkably slower than the 4.0 liter in my Cherokee. The interior is comfortable, plenty of room in the backseat and the back doors are very accessible. I would however, change the headrests in the rear seat, as they are a bit high and tend to restrict visibility out of the rear window. Odometer: 158 miles.",1
902,"Only have had the car for 3 weeks (500 miles). It's fun to drive, looks great, and is roomy inside. Looks like a car that costs $1,000's more than it does. We were going to buy an '08 Malibu LTZ but decided on the Wolfsburg instead. (More standard features and cheaper price.)",1
903,"First off, I'm an admitted car nut. Get all the mags, spend too much time on car lots late at night. When deciding on a new car, my priorities were safety, AWD, engineering, style, and value. This one has it all in spades.",1
904,"I bought my Cobalt a year ago and still LOVE it! I had always driven v8's so was a little concerned about going to a 4 cyl, but was very surprised with how much power it actually has. It also handles very well. I live on back country roads and it takes curves wonderfully. Plenty of trunk space makes traveling easy. Also has a GREAT stereo system. The remote start is also great for warming up or cooling down the interior before getting. The back seat is a little tight though.",1
905,"I bought this car two weeks ago. I have enjoyed every second I drive in it. I love that you're in a compact car but you sit high like you're in an SUV. Great pick up and quick slow down. Get lots of curious looks in the car, people not knowing what in the world it is. I absolutely love it.",1
906,"The 2008 Enclave has been a great car to date. It has been a pleasure to drive. Very comfortable and very roomy. Gas mileage has been as expected. Have been getting 22.7 MPGs on highway / 16 MPGs around town. Very good for a vehicle this size. Another buyer who never thought he'd be in a GM or Buick product but was won over (considered Mazda CX-9 & Toyota Highlander). Great car after 2,000 miles. Very smooth ride (my mother is ready to trade in her Lexus RX 450). We'll see what the future holds.",1
907,"This car is pretty good: it handles well, is pretty good on gas and is quite comfortable. It?s one major drawback is what they perceive to be a marketing plus: OnStar. It is unreliable, an annoyance, and definitely not worth the money. With so many other equally acceptable alternatives out there (unfortunately for the domestic manufacturers, most of them are foreign made) it is a shame that we are effectively forced by GM to look elsewhere if we are to be able to get a car we really want. What really stinks is that most of the rental cars are not equipped with OnStar but the general public is not offered this same level of courtesy.",1
908,"I bought this car after many months considering the various options. I can truly say that for the money it has been a very good car. It serves its purpose very well for a couple. However, a family will find it tight to fit. My wife and I absolutely love this car. We have done 2 long trips with it and have been very pleased with the gas mileage, it has been exactly as described. It is my first Jeep and all I have to say is ""Well Done Jeep"".",1
909,"I traded in a '01 Audi A4 for my '07 5-door Rabbit. I loved my A4, but I love the Rabbit more. The only feature missing from my Audi is the Homelink and auto-dim mirrors. Everything else is just as good or better. This was definitely not a step down. Everything about this car is just right and the value is unbeatable. It's quick, fast, and super comfortable. You're not likely to come across many others out on the roads, so it's cool to be driving a unique car. I agree with the poster that said if they made this any nicer, it would be an Audi. I thought I might regret not getting the GTI, but I definitely do not. While I love the 2.0T, this 2.5 is a fantastic engine.",1
910,"I owned a 1990 2 wheel drive Toyota extra cab for 18 years. Best vehicle I ever owned. I sold it with over 300,000 miles on it. I wanted a 4 wheel drive new p/u. I love this pick up more than any vehicle I have ever owned or driven. It is a fast and good looking p/u. I love the stereo system/cd player. It has a lot of pick up and contrary to reports I've read my pick up is very quiet. I've had no problems at all in the 14 months I've owned it. Although the running boards look great, they are in the way trying to get into and out of the p/u. I would never own any other kind of mid- sized truck besides the Toyota. To me it is the best truck on the road. Bar none!",1
911,I am so pleased with my new Sky. I got it as the result of the person that ordered it was not able to do the finance when the car arrived at the dealership and I happened to be at the right place at the right time. Everywhere I go I get a thumbs up or questions about the car with everyone saying it is really hot. At my age I love the attention and consider it my poor man's Corvette. My license plate reads - I SKY,1
912,"Even after 8 months I still can't really find anything that I don't love about this car. It's fast, and fun to drive while being economical and roomy. It's almost like being in a small suv size wise, but with the heart of a racer. All of my friends and family are impressed with it, and people in parking lots have stopped to ask me questions about it. My brother actually purchased his 2008 pearl white one yesterday. We now have a family of Mazda Speed3s.",1
913,"Loving this Jeep. Hard to find the negatives about it. For those who want more power and complain that it's whimpy, go buy something bigger. It's that simple. But if you are looking for a smaller cheaper SUV and want to park in more places than bigger SUVs, then get this Jeep! I recommend this to anyone. Well, the limited version anyway.",1
914,I wanted to write this review due to the fact that people have complained about this lovely car a lot. I got a 08 Chevy Aveo because I needed something better for my job and this car fit perfectly. No it doesn't have the power of a Corvette but if I wanted the power of a Corvette I would have bought one! This car has been getting me from point A to point be and this is a nice family car but sporty looking too!,1
915,"The car is great for the price. If you're buying it to throw a bunch of money into mods however, I would suggest you move up to the Civic Si. The tC has two fundamental flaws that enthusiasts will have to spend a lot of money to overcome. One is the lack of an LSD, and the other is the glass roof. The glass roof makes the car heavy at a place you want a car to be as light as possible. If you're looking for an affordable, good looking, reliable, daily driver with a hint of sportiness, this is the car for you.",1
916,Well this is my very first SUV and my very first brand new vehicle. I had a 2004 Mazda3 and a 1999 Dodge Avenger before this Jeep. I haven't had it long but I absolutely LOVE it. We looked at several different SUV's before purchasing this one and we were definitely happy with this purchase when we drove it home. I have always loved Jeeps and I was definitely happy to finally own one. It doesn't even hesitate to go through the snow we have and I feel so much safer in it. My dad did own the old body style of the Liberty and I definitely love the changes they have made!,1
917,"We purchased the vehicle a week ago. The engineering is very good, amazing to think they could pack in as much in such a small vehicle. I was concerned about the gas mileage but now after about 600+ miles seem to be averaging 21 to 22+ mpg. It is fast and if you drive it like a race car it will only get 16 to 17 I am sure. I still have not had a chance to read all of the instructional info but believe once I figure it out it will be a blessing. The hands free blue tooth is great. The leather and interior is as nice as Mercedes and more higher end cars. My wife had some problems with the smart key etc. in her first foray driving about 400 miles. She got pulled over going over 80 mph.",1
918,After going from my 13 yr old base style Corolla to this standard loaded out car I feel like I've hit the jackpot for a great price. I absolutely love it. It has pep and looks very smart. This is my favorite car I've ever had. Well worth every penny even if you don't add a thing. Feels like I'm gliding on glass it is so smooth. With the Toyota name behind it you can't go wrong. Get one!!,1
919,"I've wanted an SUV for a While, but never liked how they handled or the gas mileage. The Compass sits a little lower and drives more like a car (can take turns a little faster. It gets good mileage, but I didn't buy it for this. It has plenty of room and is lots of fun to drive. I notice people look at me a lot, I don't know if its just a brand new car (model too) or just that I'm a good looking guy. Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase and look forward to having it a very long time.",1
920,"I stumbled on the Fit completely by accident walking through the dealership looking to buy a Civic, and walked out driving it. The fold flat seats were an immediate seller for me as no trunk can hold the things the Fit can. I think I probably paid a little too much at $15,900 for the MT but I was in a time crunch. My Fit came with sweet tinted windows that I would strongly suggest to anyone, it makes the car look very unique and sporty not to mention keeping your seats from bleaching and reducing theft. I have tracked my MPG for the first 4000 miles and I?m getting 26/36. The M/T is definitely the way to go, must quicker than my A/T 127 hp ?03 Civic. I would recommend this car to anyone!",1
921,It was time to get out of my minivan phase and into a sedan. I spent way too much time checking out the Japanese cars and ended up with the Aura. You get a wide variety of features for the money that just wasn't available on the competitors (unless I wanted to pay thousands more). And the Aura's styling and comfort are first rate. The power in this car will stand up to anyone.,1
922,"I am extremely happy with my FX35 and could not imagine driving another car or SUV period. I love the fact that I can take it anywhere or do anything and look good doing it. The woods to go camping one day, and to a show in town the next, I have found the perfect car for me.",1
923,"I originally posted here on 12/11/2006, three days after I picked up my MX-5. Well, here I am about 1 year later and I still love this car. I have nothing but great things to say -- still getting 30 mpg and have had no problems with the car. The PRHT is perfect; interior/exterior finish still looks great; no issues requiring any service or repair; extremely fun to drive with plenty of responsiveness; 6-speed automatic works great; still an amazing vehicle. I still suggest that you go get one!! ;-)",1
924,"I love this little SUV! I was a little worried about getting an SUV. I drove a 99 Honda Prelude for over 9 years. It was so small and low to the ground, but I have had no problems adjusting to the CR-V! I love Hondas and I fell in love with the CR-V the moment I saw it. When my husband and I test drove it, that was it! It is so much fun to drive and it handles great! I wish the gas mileage was a little better, but hopefully it will improve, as I only have 175 miles on it! It is nice to use regular gas. My Prelude required premium! It's also nice having so much room! I can actually take people in my backseat!",1
925,"They hybrid engine takes a little getting used to. It's now two weeks after I started driving it, and I find I am getting over 40 mpg in mixed city and highway driving. I traded in a 2004 Camry for the Hybrid and the improvements were quite noticable. This is a comfortable, sprited well engineered vehicle. A family car that is great to drive. The gas savings put this car over the edge as far as being the right choice for the family sedan.",1
926,"I just got this car last week, and I love it. I had a van and was worried that it would be hard to adjust to a smaller vehicle, but it wasn't. The Versa has a lot of head room and driver and passengers sit up fairly high. There is a lot of room in this little car. And I love the way it looks. It drives nicely and has a lot of pep, too. I haven't had it long enough to check if the mileage is as advertised, but I'm sure it'll be better than the van.",1
927,"This is my first minivan, my previous car was a 2001 Lexus gs300. i am very pleased with this van, comfortable, quiet, great ride, even quieter and tighter than the gs300, but that is to be expected. The engine is not as silky as the gs300 which personally is probably the best 6 cyl engine in the world.",1
928,Being the last year of the Ranger I`m glad I ordered one when I did. I`ve been extremely pleased with this vehicle. It works exceptionally well in off-road conditions even with the factory street tires and gets me about 20 MPG on a trip. Regular gas is still the cheapest and it works well to deliver all the power I need.,1
929,"I bought this car because I was getting killed at the pump by my Nissan Titan. I love being able to drive by the gas stations instead of stopping to fill up. the car looks great, runs great, and am getting over 28 mpg. I plan to have this car in my stable till it craps out, which by the quality of it; I may crap out first. Its one peppy 4 banger!!",1
930,I've owned my '07 E350 with the no-cost sport option for 30 days and I could not be happier with it. I hope it is reliable. So far so good. I purchased the extended 7 year warranty. My '97 E320 was very unreliable and gave me a lot of problems.,1
931,"With 32,500 miles I've never been happier with a truck. I've owned Ford, Chevy (2), and Dodge trucks. The only thing that comes close to the Tundra was a Duramax. Driving the Tundra feels like the Duramax, just I can't tow as much. I installed the KN Cool Air Intake, gives it even more hp and sounds cool.",1
932,"This is a great vehicle to drive. It's fun and sporty, but also very safe and economic. Great job Volkswagen.",1
933,"I love this car. I think that the best way to describe just how great this car is to tell you what my dad said. He just bought the new Lexus sports car and he says that if he could do it all over again he would have gotten the 08 Altima Coupe because it drives almost as well and looks sharper on the outside, is more comfortable, and when you factor in that it is half the price it's a no brainer.",1
934,"This car is amazing! Style, performance, and quality are all 10. The 4cyl turbo is great, plenty of kick to it. Peformance and economy, my last fill up was averaged at 30mpg. I was hesitant to purchase an automatic, what's the fun of a sports car that you can't shift? However, the paddle shifters are a lot of fun, and make up for a spouse that can't drive stick. The top drops smooth and speedy. Nice to be able to put it up or down when moving. The launch control feature is a blast! It will light the tires up like it had 400 horses under the hood. Great in the snow as FWD only.",1
935,"When loaded with leather, heated seats, retractable sun roof and a fine sound system this vehicle is nearly as good as the Hyundai Acera. The car cruises on the highway extremely well. It does not have the pep I would like but it does the job especially when fueled with E-85. This flex fuel vehicle gets a big lift from the higher octaine gasoline that helps solve the sluggish pickup problem. I found the vehicle not as comfy as my Cadillac Deville but it was nearly as nice. The price of this vehicle is right. The 28k I saved made me feel a heck of alot better in giving up my Cadillac for the 31 mpg I now get on the freeway. Good value, good on gas and nice looking to boot.",1
936,"i recently purchased my '07 yaris hatchback and i LOVE IT! it is extremely spacious on the inside and i love all of the available features, the armrest(very comfortable), the aux jack which is even better because it is accesible with i-pods, keyless entry, power windows, etc.. this car is a dream. Lots of pickup, this car really likes to go even though it only has 109 hp. The digital gauges are a fun new feature that i havent yet seen in a toyota(my family owns only toyotas).",1
937,"I purchased a Caliber RT AWD 5 months ago and I really enjoy this mid car. It rides great, AWD and ESP are awesome, it's perfect for Quebec winter conditions. The Caliber is fun to drive, specially in snow.",1
938,"We bought this for my wife, after looking at numerous cars and sitting behind the wheel, she like this the best. She was happy with the styling, performance and handling. No other manufactor could come near the price and the warranty is great. I have owned Suzukis' before and I'm very happy with their reliabilty. She wanted the sunfoof model but they were sold out.",1
939,As an owner I say it is a very sporty and classy car with a lot of power and is smooth to drive. I'll recommend this car to anyone!,1
940,"I have owned this car for little less than 6 months after acquiring it from a family relative. The car has treated me well so far through the later part of the winter, spring and now into summer. Gas mileage is decent, comfort is excellent, highway noise is minimal, drivetrain noise is minimal. I have an automatic which shifts smoothly for the most part but is jerky when under hard quick acceleration. The car is unfortunately terribly slow (even compared to my 94 VW GTI 2.0l). It keeps me out of trouble though. Handling is pretty good for stock suspension. And lastly the interior build is decent, the seats could use more support and better materials.",1
941,"I absolutely love this pickup. I had just purchased an 07 chevrolet silverado about 4 months ago, just got this, and am now wondering why I ever bought the Chevy. It has much better acceleration, more stylish, more towing, more payload, and overall better build quality also. I never much cared for the Tundras til this year, when they gave it a face lift. It's now bigger and beefier than ever. I'm a big guy, 6'4"" 265 lbs, and I fit in it a whole lot better than I did the Chevy. It has a lot more interior space, and I love the floor shifter.",1
942,"Coming from a Honda Civic the Sierra 1500 feels like a monster. What a dream to drive. I actually enjoy driving to work now. One of the first things I noticed was how quiet the ride is. With the windows up road noise is virtually none existent. I've been getting around 16.6mpg with all around driving. I suspect that will go up as the motor breaks in, but hey if you're looking for fuel economy buy a prius and just hope that someone in a 1500 doesn't hit you. I highly recommend getting the remote start option. I always start the truck a few minutes before I leave and it either turns on the heater or AC depending on the inside temp of the truck. Nothing like hoping into the perfect climate.",1
943,"I love this car. I owned an MDX before purchasing the 2008 with the new body style and roomier interior. I opted for the loaded version. I think the joystick navigation is wonderful and so much easier to use. I also love the new body style. The inside is roomier than the older version. With trying to stay in the midsize SUV and having a 3rd row seat, this can't be beat. The 3rd row folds down flat for lots of cargo space when not using the 3rd row. Also, with the position of the handles now being in the middle instead of the top of the seats, it is much easier to pull the seats up when using the 3rd row. One simple tug and ""presto"" - extra seating. Great buy! You'll love it!",1
944,"Don't believe me do you? Most people don't know that Ford owns Range Rover. Many times I rode in my friend'd $80k Rover and salivated. Then I drove the Edge and oh my gosh! I felt right back in the Rover. Same wheel, stereo, ride, feel, stiffness, and power. It's even faster than a BMW X5. It is also the first Ford to appear prestigious in all manner of profiles. Nav and XM are also perfect, just lacked Bluetooth. Oh, and the entire back seat reclines so far back that Hulk Hogan could side cross his legs. Folding front seat into a table-esque platform makes it a limo, and the center console can conceal an entire laptop. Perfect, just perfect.",1
945,I have had this car for about 3 months and in general I love it. Like the review below mine sometimes it doesn't turn over when starting like it should. This happens randomly and for no apparent reason. My only major complaint is the rear bumper. I think it is made poorly and within the first month I noticed a rock had hit the underside of the tire casing and made a notch in the paint. After closer inspection I noticed that there is another part where the paint is pulling away where the metal body and plastic bumper of the car meet. You can hardly see it now but I fear in time it will grow. My biggest suggestion would be to examine your bumper before purchasing this car!,1
946,"This is my 6th Vette including 3 C6s in the last 2 years. My Vettes have always been my daily driver. I have owned Porches, Infinity, Lincoln, Cadillac and other find automobiles during my forty plus years of car ownership. This is the most exciting auto experience of all my dealings. The performance is unbelievable. The reliably of my last four Vettes has been perfect with absolutely not one warranty issue and zero for this one now in it's second month and 2200 miles. A perfect and most rewarding experience!",1
947,"I traded a Tacoma 4x4 @17+ mpg for this hybrid. I no longer need a truck and I couldn't be happier with the Camry Hybrid. It' been cold here, but I'm still averaging 36.5 mpg. I couldn't be happier.",1
948,"Super impressed with this car (so far)! We've owned Mercedes (S, CLK, & E - Class), Jaguars, and Audis in the past and are tired of paying $200+ for a key-fob!! Switched to Japanese for the reliability factor...and...there's not many of these on the road (vs. 3- series BMW! Quicker 0-60 than my 99' CLK 430!! Would have paid another 20K for a similar model Lexus!",1
949,"First time owner of a Mercedes. Engine and transmission very smooth. Nice handling. Lots of standard features, including safety features. Very fast in breaking. Took car to almost 130 - yeah, crazy me!! Car felt very smooth - can't feel the speed. I cruise on freeway and realize I have to ease on the pedal - I'm doing 90. Only 1 complaint - you feel the bumps too hard. Needs improvement on suspension. Yes, it has a sports suspension which has been lowered over the luxury model, but you sure feel those bumps. I've taken few pounds off pressure of the tires to releave this problem - much beter, however, my ""check pressure"" keeps coming up.",1
950,"This is our 2nd Highlander. My wife and I liked the 2001 so much, that we decided to buy the 2007 before the upcoming redesign. The size and practicality is perfect for our family. We live in upstate NY, so 4 wheel drive is important, but the vehical never goes off road so we don't need a heavy 4x4 SUV. The Highlander meets all of our needs.",1
951,"Almost everything about this car is amazing. Each shift is smooth and, though I scoot it around >4000rpm VTEC range here and there, I'm still averaging just over 32mpg city driving. Handling is surprisingly superb, with a somewhat stiffer suspension than other cars. (Fit slalom speed is only 0.5mph under the 8th gen Si). The 200-watt stereo is quite adequate, with an unexpected amount of bass coming froms the mids (no sub). Space is amazing! It's much roomier than it looks; at least, that's what everyone has said to me when they've got a ride. My only complaint is the lack of JDM accessories (i.e. armrest, passenger vanity, maplights, LED tail lights, HID, sunroof, subwoofer, navi, etc)",1
952,"Ever since giving up on the Chrysler because of its poor performance and gas guzzling tendencies, this vehicle provides the ideal alternative. Better cachet and a much more maneuverable package, the Volvo matches or exceeds all the Pacifica benefits, then goes further with laser enhanced cruise control, satellite stereo, built-in child seats, and a really effective bluetooth system. still, I wish it were more economical.",1
953,"I really like this car. It came with pkg.#2 and the communication pkg - plus iPod connection. Prior to this, I owned a 2003 BMW 325xi. The Benz offers a larger, smoother ride and looks sharp. I've driven 1000 miles and like it more and more each day.",1
954,"I recently traded in my 2005 Acura TL for a 2008 Honda Civic EX-L. I know, why would you do that? Well, I drive about 30K a year,my TL had 60K miles and it was time to either keep it till death or trade. I could have got another TL or similar car, but the premium gas and the mileage were starting to hurt. So I went hunting for something simpler and more economical. I considered a hybrid, but the numbers just don't work. The Civic is a good choice. It is peppy and fun to drive, it has everything you need. It's comfortable and very economical. I'm averaging 31+ mpg, I've had it 3 weeks and have over 1700 miles already. I added the leather, I think it brings the car to the next level.",1
955,"Car is so much fun to drive and has tons of cool features! I really like the advanced air bags and how the back seats recline, fold up, and fold down. This car has tons of head room! Gets excellent gas mileage! I love it!",1
956,"Absolutely love this vehicle. It is very quick with the V6 engine, and gets great gas mileage (25 mpg) for a 4wd, V6, SUV. The dimension of the vehicle are great too. Not too big, and not too small, and looks great.",1
957,"I had a 2005 500 AWD which was an excellent car. Bought it used , ex rental, I drove it until 2008 and never put a penny into it except normal services. During that time I got 30mpg on the highway at posted speeds. If you put your foot down the mileage dropped like everything else on the road. Best big car I have had. In 2008 I had promised myself a new 500. When Ford changed the name I pretty well gave up until I tried it out. The car is not much different than the 500 except the trans and engine. Otherwise the Taurus is a 500. I have the sel AWD which handles better than anything else I have including a 2007 F150 4X4. This truck I leave parked during the winter and drive the car. Best car yet",1
958,"I have always been a Honda Accord owner but with a growing family, I needed a larger sedan (able to handle a car seat and two additional kids in the backseat without touching each other). The 2007 Avalon has been great. It has a great interior for the price tag vs Lexus or BMW.",1
959,"This is my third Miata, and I've had one from each generation. Mazda has taken a great car and made it even better. The car remains lightweight and agile but adds horsepower and more refined ergonomics. I have a wide frame and fit much better in this car than in previous generations. The engine is super smooth, the manual transmission has a short throw and shifts easily, and new alternatives like xenon headlights improve refinement. I had a Porsche Boxster S between my last Miata and this one. After I sold the Porsche I wanted another two seat convertible without spending $50k+. Even though the Porsche is faster and gets better skidpad ratings, the Miata is a better value. Great car",1
960,"This is my 3rd Jeep. My 1st was a 94 with the 5.2 V8 and my 2nd a 01 with the 4.7 V8. I recently got the Limited with the 5.7 Hemi and Quadra-drive 4X4. Every option available on the car was ordered. I have always been a big Jeep fan, but this new model is much more refined than expected. I compared to ""luxury"" SUVs, and for the price, there is no comparison. The engine has plenty of pep, and the interior is nicer than the Lexus or Infinity I looked at. I don't care what the reviews say, the Jeep is as big as any ""crossover"" in terms of interior space, but the build quality is much higher of any SUV I looked at. This is definitely a huge contender against any SUV you look at.",1
961,"Had to replace my Ford Explorer after a drunk driver took it out. Was going to downsize to a Rav-4 6 cylinder. Compared Highlander and was sold on it. For basically the same cost got much more. 2 row seating comes with many options, converts to bench type seating, can have a table in between the seats or converts to captain's seats. Kids love their seating area.",1
962,"I really enjoy my Yaris, I get great gas milage and It is a great car for anyone that doesn't want to pay that much for great quality",1
963,Have to get use to the small engine but it runs great on the highway it will run with some of the best out there on the highway with know problems at all.,1
964,"Had a 2006 Avalon and was hit head on by a pickup truck. Survived because of the air bags, seat belts and the front crush panels engineered into the car. Replaced the Avalon with a new 2007 Avalon. Shifts smoother, rides like a dream, and has even better milage than the 2006. I get 30/31 mpg on the road and 23/24 in town and for a full sized sedan that is amazing.",1
965,"I absolutely LOVE my new Ford Escape. I've had it for about 6 months now, and I love it just as much today as the first day I bought it. The design is so gorgeous inside and out. The V6 has a lot of get up. It's extremely comfortable. I see other Escapes on the road and smile because it really is a GREAT looking car. Everyone who rides in it is surprised by how nice it really is. In fact, a friend of mine went out and bought one last week. I definitely recommend this to everyone.",1
966,"I purchased an '07 RAV4, February, 2008, used, from a Toyota dealer, replacing a '01 Ford Taurus. Bought a 4 cyl, fwd. Use for daily commuter and weekend chores. Occasional trips. Just recently, averaged 27.5 mph at a steady 75 mph on a 500 mile round-trip. Around town, am getting 22 to 24 mph. As a daily driver, the car is excellent. Perfect for weekend chores. The swing rear door does cause some problems while carrying lumber, however, I knew that when I purchased the vehicle. Otherwise, car is perfect for intended use. Am very pleased with performance, handling, and overall build.",1
967,"I bought Prius in May 2007. In one year I have driven about 17,000 miles and thought I should write something to benefit other potential buyers. I am extremely happy with ride, comfort, performance etc, but most of all with fuel efficiency. I have been consistently getting 52-53 mpg for last one year, with air on 7 months out of 12 months. The best mileage I have received so far is 62 MPG, while the worst was 47 MPG (when I drove 90 miles/hour long distance, full load and AC on.) Settled on Prius for it's high power engine and electric motor, uniqueness and last but not the least, a Prius is Prius!",1
968,"Love driving my Fit! It does fit anywhere, and is very comfortable inside. I have two six foot sons, and they say there is enough room. I took four basketball players to a funeral and they all fit!",1
969,I swore off all American vehicles but then realized I needed the room so I looked at the Denali..what a surprise!! This SUV is awesome.. blows away the other two Fords I have owned. I don't feel like I am driving a truck. This redesign is nothing like the previous model and a loaded Denali is no different then the Escalade without the price tag and bling factor. I LOVE this SUV!!,1
970,"After driving my 2007 Camry for 38,000 miles, it was time to get something a bit more comfortable. After having 3 Park Avenues (one of which I put 303,000 on), which are VERY comfortable cars, I was very unhappy with the Camry in the comfort area. I LOVE my Avalon Touring Sedan - so far. Comfortable, quiet, looks nice inside and out. Heck, I'm thinking of up-grading to a Limited with all of the bells and whistles. :) It's very early and my MPG isn't all that great (21-23 +/-), but I'll gladly give up a bit of MPG for the rest of the package. Yes I WOULD tell anyone to purchase one.",1
971,"I bought this car to replace my SUV. After attaining 41 mpg at 70+ mph, I'm finding fewer reasons to use the SUV. I don't feel underpowered when merging into traffic. The ride is more nimble and sporty than the SUV. The cabin is quiet enough, given the aerodynamic styling. Although the seats could be more comfortable and the stereo more powerful, I remind myself that I bought a low-priced car for great mileage. I bought a Honda, not a Lexus.",1
972,Great mid-size with plenty of interior space.,1
973,"Was looking at the Jeep Liberty and other SUV's. Was skeptical about the Compass because of some reviews. The Compass drives more like a car and much better comfort than the Jeep Liberty IMO. Bought the FWD auto, and the power is very adequate and the ride is very smooth and quiet. Goes down the freeway at 70mph no problem. The paint finish is great. This is the wife's daily driver and she loves the comfort, style, overall handling. We bought it for town and freeway driving, not off-road. Jeep has a winner in the price group. Would recommend the 26E package and Drivers Convenience group if you like a little more power options and gadgets.",1
974,"I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like this car. It's very roomy and quiet on the road with a lot of features not available on the competition. I have the mid-grade LT1, front wheel drive model. It's easy to see out of fore and aft, so driving, parking and backing up is easy. The gas mileage is great; I have been averaging over 20 city/hiway and it only requires regular gas. Given I have only the mid level model; it doesn't drive sporty but is pretty agile. However, it can feel tipsy in very windy driving conditions, which makes the steering feel a too light. Upgraded models might mitigate this. Lastly, while the seats are comfy, they are a bit too soft on long drives.",1
975,"Does everything well instead of compromising one performance area to excel in another. For example, corners as if on rails but preserves quiet, comfortable ride. The engine is smooth and quiet around town but makes operatic noises at the top of the rev range. This is the perfect luxury car for with enough confidence to eschew driving a visible status symbol. I drove Audis before they went upscale to compete directly with Mercedes and BMW. This Acura now fills that niche of artful, understated luxury that makes one look smart, not status conscious.",1
976,"It was an impulse buy - hooked up with the dealer over the internet, real nice sales guy...followed up, went into the dealership about 2 days later (right down the street), went out for a test drive, loved it, and before I knew it, I was signing papers. Haven't looked back since. I love this car.",1
977,"This SUV is rock solid yet handles very well for a full size vehicle. The interior is very comfortable and cabin noise is very minimal. If you need seating for 7 this is the flagship vehicle. Vastly superior to the Audi Q7, Burban, mini-vans or anything else for that matter. If you want people mover, the search is over. I came out of a 2006 GM product that thought the service center was it's second home. Mercedes exudes quality and the dealership personnel treat you better. Quality does not cost, quality pays.",1
978,"It took me 3 weeks to locate a black GT. It was definitely worth the wait. This car is the most versatile car out there. Below 3000rpm it is about equal to a Mazda 3. Then the turbo kicks in. It is a rocket sled. The WRX is more expensive with less power. The cobalt is cheaper and looks and handles cheaper. The G35 is nice but too pricey. To put this much power into a front wheel drive and make it work is an engineering marvel. The interior design is slick as well, the suspension is tight, and I love the headlight beam adjustment control option. The Bose system is very nice, and there is the midi port for mp3 players as well. The hatchback feature also gives it a lot of cargo room",1
979,"This is a really good car at this price. Good exterier, fantastic stereo, good power, 100000 miles/5 years limited warranty, etc. A lot of good things. I love this car. Although somebody told me the interior is not good, I chose the light interior, and it is really great.",1
980,"I have had my Sky for 4 months, and have 12,000 miles on it now. I bought the chili pepper red with black interior. Handles great. Everywhere I go, it turns heads. Have to take extra time everywhere I stop because of people wanting to look and talk about it. I haven't had any problems with it at all. Only taken it to the shop for oil changes and tire rotation. I am getting about 28mpg average. This surprised me. I love this car!",1
981,"Convertible sports car owners eat your heart out! The open air driving experience doesn't get any better than this...and you don't have to worry about getting a ticket racing anyone. It sure is nice not to worry about the road conditions limiting you when the outdoors call. I used to have to get friends with high clearance vehicles and 4x4's to take me to the hiking and biking trail heads. Not anymore, I am like a dog in the back of a pickup truck now days, smiling the whole time, and I go when I want. I have a Sahara with all of the bells and whistles because I liked the fenders the same as the body color. It is a great way to travel in a very capable vehicle in style.",1
982,"Traded a 2005 Silverado Crew Cab for the Nissan, and have been very pleased so far. Excellent power and smooth shifts. Hauls wife & kids like a full- size car, but carries anything you can throw in the back or hook to the hitch. Very comfortable seats and roomy cab with great options. Would prefer an auto 4WD mode and a Neutral on the transfer case, as well as mechanical anit-spin differentials instead of the brake system. Love the R-F sound system and the DVD entertainment. Could do without the 20"" rims and low-profile tires as I prefer capability over bling. Have had a couple minor issues, but I've had that with every truck I've ever owned.",1
983,"This is a great truck! It has, what seems like, unlimited power, pretty good gas mileage and outstanding creature comforts. The interior of the truck makes long drives easy; I wish I had this truck in college, it would have made the road trips even more exciting.",1
984,"I decided that maybe Audi had just created the perfect luxury car. After 3k miles I believe they have. It is perfectly silent when you want it to be. Want to be sporty? One or two down shifts and a tap of the right foot and you know you are in the right car. The electronics are well thought out too. Handling stuns. The throttle is not too sensitive. No problem (did they fix it?). Looks? Subjective, yes, but it makes a very discrete statement. I am very happy my S8. And I don't miss my 997 a bit.",1
985,"Need car after 10 yrs w/Infiniti. Considered many others, 4 & 6 cyl. Avalon smoothest suspension & plenty of amenities; seems as if it's on Lexus LS platform, w/o the price or quite the cache-but also w/o premium gas requirement. Avg > 30 mpg on my first highway drive & overall ave. ~ 24.5 miles per gallon in mixed city and hwy driving. JBL 12 spkr very nice. Highly recommend.",1
986,"We absolutely love this car! This is my wife?s car but I try to make excuses everyday just to drive it. The 2.0T engine is fabulous! No turbo lag and handling is great. DSG is amazing! I am not sure why high end cars don?t have DSG. This will be the benchmark for sequential gear boxes and the future of changing gears. The finish is fantastic. VW has put the fun back in the Jetta. Reliability is still a question mark. Hopefully VW fixed this issue. Overall, this car is a sensation! Should you get one? You bet you should.",1
987,"Having been a Ford Pickup owner for several years, I was not sure how a Saturn would fit into the equation. When I first saw this car, I was hooked. I test drove other cars, but my mind always went back to the Aura. I did not think I would really fall for this car, but was I wrong. Everything about it is great! The ride is smooth and quiet and the steering wheel controls are a plus. Driving this car is a highlight of my day!",1
988,"I have driven the CR-V 55,000 in a little over 2 years. This included about 3,000 miles of towing a trailer a max load. Other than routine maintenance (Oil, new tires, etc.) I haven't had any problems. MPG is about 28 highway / 21 in town. I wash and maintain the car regularly and it looks new. I use a leather conditioner on the seats every month. The leather in the driver seat is showing some minor wear. This car has been outstanding.",1
989,"I've been driving a midsize SUV and been waiting for this kind of fuel efficient crossover long time. Test-drove Murano, but heck, it's too overpriced. Finally I test drove an Edge and just I was sold to it. The fuel economy is much better than I expected and the vista roof gives me a huge view to the sky, which is terrific. So nice looking outside and very BIG inside. The inside space is one of my favorites. The gauges and controls are convenient and friendly. V6 and auto go very well together. I love to drive my Edge everyday. It's fun to drive. The trunk space is also very generous and 2nd row seat is big enough for my 6' 5"" son. 18"" tire is a good idea, too.",1
990,"I owned a 2005 Honda Hybrid and drove it for 35,000 miles and loved the car. I could get 50 MPG if I was really careful and did not use the A/C. My overall MPG was about 4 5MPG. My son now owns the car and I shipped it out to him from Florida to California. He is getting 38 to 42 MPG. I purchased a new 08 Honda and we are getting 50 MPG using the A/C. The new car is much improved over the 05 Honda in every way. Honda has managed to make a great little car even better. I even love the two tiered dashboard. I only have one minor complaint. I wish Honda would reposition the hand brake.",1
991,"Bought the car on Dec 31, 2007. 2008 Mazda 5 GT. Power is adequate. Acceleration is ok, handling is superb, great gas mileage. About 23-25 mpg in LA traffic, but I did log 31 mpg going to San Francisco with 3 adults and 2 kids. Took me a long time to decide between the new CRV to the 5, but I sincerely believe that I made the right choice.",1
992,I got a great deal on this little car more than a year ago and wanted to write a review. It's been a great for in town and it drives well on longer trips. Our two children fit easily in the back seat and the trunk has plenty of room for short trips. We have a manual and our average gas mileage is 32 mpg in town and 38 mpg on the hwy. I think it is the best bang for the buck when compared to other manufactures. My experience has been great with all Toyota products.,1
993,"This a great economy car. I consistently get around 30 mpg on 50/50 highway city drive. The reliability has been excellent so far. The ride is where this vehicle is lacking a lot. Maybe the goal was to make the car with stiff suspension to look and handle more sporty. The result is rough ride with clearly pronounced and annoying bumps - ""haystack wagon"" as somebody else called it. My other car is Huyndai Elantra and believe me the difference in ride quality is huge.",1
994,"This CX 9 is a replacement for my wife's 03 Highlander. We compared it to the 08 Highlander and the 08 Murano. When my wife first sat in the CX 9, we knew that we found her next SUV. We bought the GT, and even with the 20 inch wheels, it rides just fine with us. My BMW 540 with the Sports package rides firmer than this.",1
995,"I just graduated high school, and was looking at a lot of cars from Toyota to Mazda to Chevy. i finally found the Hyundai Elantra.Searching all over for the SE was crazy. if ur looking for an SE good luck finding one. The warranty is the best. The car is quiet and has a lot of room. the trunk is huge! the Elantra also gets very good gas, i have a 136 miles already and not even a half a tank.",1
996,"Wherever you go, you can hear people announce your arrival (""Smart car!""). That aside, the car has unexpected power on the highway. This car, like a small dog, doesn't know it's small. Love the convertible top, though, which can open and close at any speed. Mercedes technology makes the car very quiet with the roof up compared to other convertibles (like the noisy Miata, for example). You get used to the upshift from 1st to 3rd, although my spouse prefers to use the paddle shifters for a smoother transition.",1
997,"I have owned a 2005 Maxima, which was totaled early this year and now a 2008 Maxima. This car is really a considerable car to purchase. The comfort and performance stands out in 2008 Maxima. There are too many car buyers down-playing the CVT engine. People have been use to the engine shifting over 50 years of cars. This Maxima with CVT has no shift shock. So it's nice and smooth driving. 0-60 in 6 seconds and I able to pull a track time of 14.8 1/4 mile in 75 degree weather. With my 05 Maxima, I put on 35K miles and had NO problems with the engine. Now with this new 2008 Maxima, I have 5K miles and still no problems. This 08 SL is worth what I spent and I highly recommend it.",1
998,"This car has exceeded my high expectations. Performance, styling, quality (inside and out) are incredible. This is an amazing car. The seats are comfortable, the ride is smooth yet sporty, and the peformance with the twin-turbo is unbelieveable. We've had the car for about a month and the whole family loves it.",1
999,"I purchased the C300 sport, 7 speed auto, 18"" AMG rims, multimedia, ipod kit, premium 1 package for a little over $40K OTD. This car is absolutely beautiful and will still look just as good in my driveway 10 years from now. The performance of this car is great and has sufficient power to press you back into your seat! The multimedia package is an absolute must for this car, especially if youre going to spend all this money. The interior looks fantastic and not ugly like the BMW 3 series. Eventhough it's a ""sport"", this car is built more for touring and cruising than racing. But why would you want to drive off fast in this car anyway? Cruise and let people stare at it!",1
