0,"Owned this 07 GL320 CDI for 15 months. Overall fuel efficiency has been 22.7 mpg through 20500 miles. On the highway, we've gotten up to 28 mpg, and always 20+ around town. Very comfortable on long trips or short commutes. Handled heavy winter snowfall in Spokane and North Idaho with ease. Couple of items to be aware of when purchasing. Uses synthetic Mobil 1, so oil changes are every 10- 12k. Oil light comes on occassionally. Dealer states it's a computer glitch that hasn't yet been corrected. OE tires (we have Continental 4x4 Contact 18"") are worn out and need to be replaced.",3
1,"This is my fourth Explorer and they just keep getting better! The features, versatility and the price can't be beat. The V-6 fuel ecomomy isn't great but, I get the same MPG that I got with my Acura MDX and I don't have to run premium fuel. The Sirius radio and Sync system are great. Towing two SEA- Doo's GTX's takes a little effort, but the vehicles handles and stops well. The third row seats are great for kids under twelve and I love the power up and down feature. The second row seats recline but they do take a little effort to move up and out so people can get into the third row.",4
2,"If you like the way it looks, you will love the way it drives. Just get in, let the generous options surround you and lean back and enjoy the ride. Very solid car and fun to drive. When I park it in the garage at night, I can hardly wait until the next morning to drive it again. Do yourself a favor, go drive one. You won't regret it.",4
3,I realized in the 1st tank of gas that I wasn't getting the MPG that Saturn told me I would get. The vehicle is rated at 16 MPG city but we struggle to get 12. It would be different if the vehicle was driven hard but it's driven very slow in a fairly small town that you don't drive over 35 MPH. I've had the vehicle back to 2 Saturn dealerships 4 times and they can't seem to figure out why it gets the poor mileage. The last Saturn dealer told me they drove it and got over 16 MPG. I offered to ride with them to verify their claim and they refused. My wife loves the vehicle but if I knew it was going to get 12 MPG I would have bought another vehicle with a V-8 engine.,2
4,Traded in a 06 Honda pilot. Now I have an RX 350 AWD the ride is a lot more like a car's. It's got the power to take off in a green light.,3
5,"I bought this car 1 year ago, after owning our last CRVLX for 8 1/2 years. We have been extremely happy with the performance and comfort of our SUV. The gas mileage is awesome. We have gotten 29-30mpg on the HWY, and 22-24 in combined city/hwy driving. Much better than our last CRV.",4
6,"Car is so quiet and smooth. Luv the bigger V-6, almost unnoticeable when it shifts. SE has very nice interior. Very comfortable. Great mileage...21 local...24 highway. Better mileage than 2003 which had small V-6. Had 2003 Santa Fe 5 years..enjoyed it so much there was no question when we went to look for a new car. No mechanical probs on the 2003 & after I'd wash it it looked like new car even after 5 years. When u consider the price & warranty, my 2008 Santa Fee is a ""no-brainer""!",4
7,"Great car, very fast, big enough for a big guy (6'-4"" size 18 shoes) to fit very comfortably. It feels a little less powerful than it actually is until you realize how much faster your going than everyone around you, its pretty smooth for a car that handles well and accelerates so fast. It would be nice if they would make a less expensive, stripped down coupe version of the G8 that could fill the void where the firebird used to be, the solstice just doesn't cut it with no v8 and being so small a 5th grader can barely get in it",4
8,"We looked at the Mazda 9, very nice, looked at Honda Pilot/CRV and Toyota RAV and Highlander, and the Hyundai Santa Fe/Veracruz, nice also. But when you compare all of the features and standard stuff, the Suzuki really blows them away. Adding the no deductible, 7 year 100,000 mile warranty, free loan car, that covers exerything except the battery and tires! Even a burned out bulb is covered! Amazing. And the Japanese made GM motor is smooth and powerful, and all the safety stuff gets is a 5 star rating.",4
9,"Bought this car new for practical reasons (not a 4 door sedan type person), and overall a decent car. Smoothest engine I've ever heard, bar none! CVT transmission works well and gas mileage averaged over 30 mpg. But overall a pretty boring drive. Handling is average, driver's seat too soft and lacks lumbar support, sun visor hits mirror when lowered, (bumper cover popped off, panels don't align well).",3
10,"In the approximately 3 weeks we have had the black on black wagon we have been stopped repeatedly by people asking what type of car is it, what year is it, is it a BMW, etc. We had 2002 Audi A6 wagon for the last four years and did not give anything up by getting this car except for saving a bunch of money. Its fit and finish are top notch, its engine excellent, its stlying is sharp, and its ride is fun. Get the sport package for no other reason than the sport seats which are much better than the ""comfort"" seats. Also it has metal on dash instead of wood for a little more sporty appearance. This car is loaded with features and technology. We also looked at BMW 325xi and Subaru Outback but this was by for the best for the money. We have had no problems to date.",4
11,"I've had my max for a few weeks now and I love it. I've driven many V6's but this CVT is, by far, the smoothest, and one of the quickest. It adjusts to your driving style so when your taking it easy, it drives in a higher gear for better fuel economy, and yes as someone said, it can feel a bit lethargic off the line in that mode. Feels like it starts in 2nd? However, if you drive a more aggressively, off the line, at 100 mph, or anywhere in between, this car is a beast! It automatically adjusts and rides in higher RPM's to stays in the ""sweet spot"" where are the power is. It's very sure-footed in corners with hardly no body roll, but feels a bit heavy. All around a quality built car.",3
12,"""CHAMPAGNE TASTE ON A BEER BUDGET"" probably covers everything that you need to know about the new Passat, and for all you non-drinkers, you just plug in your cool key and drive. The value to cost ratio is excellent. I tend not to keep cars for over 3-4 years, so as for reliability, the Passat will probably work just fine or will be covered under warranty. On the other hand, my wife has the C. Beetle and she loves it.",4
13,"Fell in love with the car's look and would be a happy camper if it weren't for all of the little hiccups the car had. I owned this car for 6 months. In those 6 months the top stopped working, the door locks and the cd player malfunctioned, the inside started rattling and squeaking, and the gas gauge broke. This was a 2007 NBC! If you are thinking about buying this car, please keep looking. Maybe a mini? Believe me when I say HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! If you already own one...good luck!",0
14,"We purchased this vehicle in Jan after searching for many months. Had a 6 cyl Ford Windstar minivan, and wanted SUV style w/o the high cost and poor gas milage. After 3300 miles, like other reviewers began hearing rattling noice in driver front side, as well as hesitation when accelerating. Brought back in at 8500 miles, and was told need new transmission! They have had to replace others. I just got the car back 3 days ago, and it STILL hesitates, however rattling is gone, for now. Loved this car, however not sure if it's going to last me many more years. Don't roll down the 2 back windows, as air pressure/noise is terrible.",1
15,"A co-worker of mine gave me a ride to work one morning. She picked me up in her Acura RL. By the time we reached work I believe I repeated the phrase - ""this is a great car"" - about 5 times. Well I own one now, just completed one year of ownership. Let me tell you folks there is no better value for money in the luxury category. I compared the RL to the BMW 5 and the Audi A6 and I saved about $15k easily. The best car that I have owned bar none. You are surrounded in luxury and comfort. The AWD, steering and handling are superb. I wonder how I ever survived the LA labyrinth without my Acura nav system - it is amazing. The only negative is the rear middle seat, it is uncomfortable.",4
16,"Bought the truck as it looked great in dark red with chrome 20"" wheels/boards and the Hemi. No disappointments, averaging 17 mpg, have driven 20k miles and have not had any warranty repairs or rattles. No complaints",4
17,"The car drives like a much more expensive sports car. The sport tuned suspension and the VSA keeps you under control at higher speeds. The V-TEC kicks in at 6000 RPM and screams like a Ferrari. So far my car is super reliable. I the overall design, reliability, gas mileage, and the 197 ponies.",4
18,I just got the car and love driving it. The best smooth drive (Civic & Vesra horrible to me) and nice handling. My only negative is you cannot shoot into traffic with it. Nice standard and satellite radio with MP3 hook up. Bought for my teenager but I enjoy driving it. Great price for the money. I could not beat it. Not sure of the gas mileage yet.. Keep posted.,3
19,The truck drives very smooth. The engine is very responsive for a V6. The truck turns like a big truck.,4
20,"First time owner of a Mercedes. Engine and transmission very smooth. Nice handling. Lots of standard features, including safety features. Very fast in breaking. Took car to almost 130 - yeah, crazy me!! Car felt very smooth - can't feel the speed. I cruise on freeway and realize I have to ease on the pedal - I'm doing 90. Only 1 complaint - you feel the bumps too hard. Needs improvement on suspension. Yes, it has a sports suspension which has been lowered over the luxury model, but you sure feel those bumps. I've taken few pounds off pressure of the tires to releave this problem - much beter, however, my ""check pressure"" keeps coming up.",3
21,"I've driven small trucks, 1/2 tons, 1 tons and now a Jeep. I'm going to stick with the Jeep. It's a lot of fun to drive and can really hang the corners without feeling like it's going to roll over. It also pulls my boats just fine and is very stable. I don't feel the Jeep getting pushed around by the trailer like some smaller trucks tend to do. The take off power seemed a bit lacking but turning off the ESP seems to cure that, but this could just all be in my head because I like this ride so much.",3
22,"I purchased the Kia Optima 1 year ago- this is my 3rd Kia. I received a Happy Birthday card from the dealer about a week before the shifter cable disengaged and nearly caused me to crash into a car while trying to park. The dealership examined the cable and said that they had never seen anything like it-nothing was broken or damaged, the cable just came off. Now, almost a month later, I am riding shotgun in my husband's truck as the cable once again has ""disengaged"". I seriously think there is a design flaw in this model and I am just glad I have never tried to used the manual shift feature-- imagine having the cable ""disengaging"" at 75 miles an hour on the interstate!",0
23,"I have a 2007 Nissan versa, I am having problems with it starting, very intermittent, turn key for about 10 seconds, just cranks over and won't start, wife embarrassed trying to start it also, also am having probems with weatherstripping falling off back doors in the same place, not overly impressed with gas mileage as what the sticker says.",0
24,"DSG, black on gray interior. Very solid build, improvement noticeable even over 2007 model (wife has 2007 wolfsburg). Great response and performance from engine and transmission both. Nice sounding engine. 2.0t is much quieter than 2.5 unless you like to hear it growl...it can be somewhat tricky to find right driver seat position, knees tend to hit center console, but i have been able to adjust the seat to minimize the discomfort. find it very hard to stay off the accelerator. can be driving 100 and not notice it. car is very solid and you can feel it. Was able to get a very good price for it. not quite a GLI without all the extra stuff but for 7000 less, you can't beat it.",2
25,"I transitioned to Chrysler several years ago via several company cars and manufacturers failed to live up to the design and quality I was experiencing with Chrysler. Well, once again Chrysler has done it! I have the 28J package in the Pearl Black and have already received several positive comments about the look. It drives flawlessly and there is plenty of room to fit my 6'5"" frame along with the rest of the family. The interior design is quality, leaps and bounds above the competition in addition to the 20 inch wheels along with Hemi put the Escalade, Navigator, and Denali series to shame. Chrylser needs to advertise more and get the word out they have a winner!",4
26,"Owned and loved a 2.5RS since '97! Very agile car and wonderful off roads but it had missing features when the kids came: folding seats, tiny backseat, latches, high profile trunk (cargo nightmare), stripped interior. Looked at the 328ix, LS 350, Evo, STi, TT, G35, 6s. All great but the spec.b outperformed and had everything I wanted on my RS. ""The WRX's older brother,"" a lot of punch with significantly more sophistication. Interior features and ride make this a serious luxury car with a kick. The spec.b was not designed to be as rugged as the RS (my off trail days on hold!) but I'm very happy with my purchase and ecstatic now that I've had it for 6 weeks and booked 4-digit miles :)",4
27,"I was so excited to get the newly re-designed 2007 Passat Wagon! What a mistake! I have had this vehicle in the shop THREE times since I purchased it in March 2006. The Engine Malfunction lights keeps coming on and the dealership cannot find the problem, except to say that that there is an evaporator leak that they cannot fix it. The service manager also stated that they had several Passats that were doing this. Please don't think that the dealership will back you up on these problems; THEY WON""T...I wrote a letter to VW and they were unwilling to help me too. Volkswagen will NOT stand behind their vehicle. The brakes squeak, too. Do not buy this vehicle.",0
28,use it to tow behind a Motorhome works great not a hiway vehicle. great for two people and a little gear. Wish it had more towing like the 4 door,3
29,"I first drove a SMART a few years ago from Vienna to Prague. I loved it, and it was much less powered and of less quality construction that my new 2008 model of 2 months and 2000 miles. It's a great little car for convenience, handling, economy and appearance. Just watch out out for potholes and speed bumps, and remember that it is a small, basically low powered car, that will still drive at 80 MPH if you want to - and maybe have to on the Interstates, where huge tractor-trailers often enjoy driving 5-10 feet behind you at that speed. Where are the cops when you need them?",3
30,"I just signed the lease on my car last week. So far, it has been great. It's cute and fun to drive. It is my first new car, so I am enjoying the new car smell :) I traded in my Acura 3.2 CL Type S, so I do feel like I am missing a little bit of power. The Jetta seems a bit sluggish. Still, I am really excited about the car. Super sweet!",4
31,"This car handles and rides incredibly. I love everything about it except the following: tilt wheel has a lever which means to move the wheel out of your way, you must move the lever and then relock every time; FM reception is fair; gas filler door is a push from the outside design. It should be a inside release or have a finger opening. The interior materials are way softer than my buddy's 530i; his door handles dig into your knees and hurt. Trunk and seats are huge. Great effort, great car. Buy one now!",3
32,"Super impressed with this car (so far)! We've owned Mercedes (S, CLK, & E - Class), Jaguars, and Audis in the past and are tired of paying $200+ for a key-fob!! Switched to Japanese for the reliability factor...and...there's not many of these on the road (vs. 3- series BMW! Quicker 0-60 than my 99' CLK 430!! Would have paid another 20K for a similar model Lexus!",4
33,"First, mileage. I get about 24 on my daily commute, 16 strictly city, on cruise-control: 25.5 at 75mph, and 33 (!) at 60mph. Acceleration is more than adequate. If you really punch it you get torque- steer, but it isn't necessary to punch it. It's been trouble-free the first year/21,000 miles. The automatic climate system is MUCH better than the one in my Mercedes and the temperature readout much more accurate than my Mercedes.",4
34,"Toyota outdid itsself with this vehicle - it is safe and fun to drive. It is more capable, functional, and reliable than Jeep or Hummer.",4
35,"Great Car. I was originally a Truck guy, But after test driving the malibu i fell in Love.I Bought a LS model with 19500 Miles On it. The 3.5 L V6 Is a must good power acceleration can use some improvement but all around Awesome. Clean car... All my Friends envy the styling of it....Chrome lined Just all Around a must Bye! Highly Recommend!",4
36,This car is a great value for mid 30's range. Its quality is second to none. This is my second Volvo and it is really a tight and great riding car,4
37,"I've had ""Spunky"" for less than a year now. Blessings and curses with this metallic blue 2007 Civic sedan are the topic. Inside & outside, this car looks and feels sweet. Sporty yet business worthy, family functional yet mid-life crisis soothing, fuel efficient yet spunky -- I thought this car had it all! The blessings are exactly what Honda would have you to realize...save a buck and fly like a buck through the woods! The curses? Wheel seals to rims: constantly failing while parked on slight lateral inclines. Major cost issue (not under warranty!): the under-carriage shield/bumper assembly fails to clear wheel stops in parking lots causing it to gradually break joints and disengage. Bad!!",2
38,"I love everything about this car. The base model is loaded and I only upgraded the wheels, headlights and added a spoiler. I purchased the Matador Red and it's just sexy. I look forward to my drive to work now!",4
39,"Love my new 2008 Sport Automatic. I researched small high mpg cars for about a year before I decided on the Fit. The FIT is a GREAT car to drive. Fun, sporty & economical!",4
40,"I just purchased the 2008 ES with CVT and oh man is it fun to drive. I got all the options including the navigation system, Sun and Sound package, and bluetooth. This car is such an upgrade from my previous car (02 Chevy Malibu). It handles corners with a breeze, and its high speed pick up is very much unexpected. My brother just bought a brand new Lexus IS 250, and my car has all the same options for less than half the price! With a few performance upgrades coming in the near future, this car will be a fast, head-turning, teched out piece of automobile art! Oh and by the way, it looks great in black!",4
41,"We made up our minds to get another Toyota, this time the Highlander. Love it. Not too big, not too small, it's just right. It handles smoothly and I have the feeling of security in it. Would suggest this auto to anyone who is looking for safety, height of 4 wheeler, and ride of Lexus. Very comfortable, love it, love it, love it. Can't go wrong buying this one. Well worth it. No negatives on this car.",4
42,"I road tested several trucks, and liked the Chevrolet, but after driving the Ford truck, I was sold!!! Great ride quality, nice interior, attractive exterior, smooth handling. Glad I opted for the bigger 5.4 engine!",4
43,"I have loved Chevrolets and GMCs for 30 years. My 03 Chevy Silverado was the best truck I have ever had. The 08 GMC has been the most disappointing truck I have ever purchased. I am constantly getting alarms that include: Park assist off, air bag, low tires when they are not. On top of the alarms that the dealer cannot fix I have had two interior fans replaced and they are rattling again. The motor is tapping even though I do the recommended everything. The ABS brakes act like I am on ice on dry road. Cheaper braking system. Already have warped discs. My o3 brakes went 144K miles. The sun visors are not wide enough to block the sun. Cannot handle the same trailer as the 03.",0
44,"I was looking for a car and happened to find the si. I have driven the older models and loved them, when I first got in the drivers seat of this car I felt like I was in a Jet ready to take off. I love the feel of the car. It sounds great, has great turning and can get up and go. You get a lot of looks in this car. This car is pretty fast if you need it to. The 8200 redline is a feature I really enjoy. When in 2nd gear and you hit the 6000 rpm the Vtec kicks in, and puts you into your seat. I cant help myself but smile every time. This Si is truly one awesome care and a GREAT purchase. I love the in car features as well. makes driving fun and comfortable.",4
45,"Traded 05 Z71 Tahoe that was fully loaded for my LTZ. Great truck, getting 19ish on highway. Dark Interior color rocks, love the power everything, rides great, fun to drive, nav is great. Already had onstar & XM but they are still nice. Excellent quality & ride is great. Considered changing brands until I drove the new style. Great job GM",4
46,I gave my Acura MDX to my daughter and was looking for another solid SUV. Fell in love with the MB GL450 at first sight. Beautiful inside and out. Then saw the 320CDI version and drove it. Couldn't believe it was a diesel. Who would believe that you could have large comfortably luxury in an SUV and get 27 mpg on the highway? I was only worried about recent MB quality surveys on Consumer Reports but felt a little better given that the GL was totally redesigned.,3
47,"The fuel economy is as good as my previous vehicle (Chevy blazer) averaged just over 17 MPG 60% hwy, 40% city. My driving style is a lot more conservative due to the price of gas. The tundra has a lot of room and excellent interior storage areas. Excellent turning radius/easy to drive. Previous reviews hammered the transmission for down shifting too much. Haven't had that problem. Did have some problems w/radio/stereo. It would turn on/off, change stations. Dealer replaced it and haven't had a problem since",2
48,"Bottom line, the Yaris is awesome. I had auto start and window tinting installed two days after the purchase. Upgraded heater package works good (I live in Alaska where the temp drops to -45 degrees). Center gauges took a little to get used to. Great head & leg room for 6' plus drivers and passengers. Test drive one for yourself. You will love it!",4
49,"I currently have one for a company vehicle. Almost 70,000 in 2 years. Vehicle has plenty of power to pull out on busy streets, interior is nicely laid out,(I have auto climate control). No SYNC on earlier model. Decent fuel economy for such a larger vehicle. Styling is nice, even after 70000 miles, its still nice to look at. Fiew issues: CHECK YOUR HOOD! Corrosion on the hoods is a MAJOR issue. I have seen over half with corrosion issues. OEM tires are Terrible! I am currently on my third set, went with GoodYear Integrity tires now. Better ride, better wear. Poor manufacturing standards; Doors don't exactly line up, hood offset, etc. Front brakes wear prematurely.",1
50,We purchased the limited version. I think that it was well worth the extra money to have leather and power everything. The heated seats are a bonus as well as it is cold in Wisconsin. We also got the moon roof and a tow hitch added on all for just under 26K. I look at the Honda's and also the Toyota but just couldn't justify paying the extra dollars.,3
51,"Very pleased with all aspects of this car. Gas mileage exceeded our expectations, getting 25.5 mpg on a recent 600 mile trip. We got just under 28 mpg on the way back. So far we seem to be averaging 20 mpg around town. Kids love the room and the third row seat. Great ride, quiet and comfortable. We're glad this vehicle came with the back up camera without having to get the nav. system. We looked for a long time and at lots of different cars, this easily was the best car for us.",4
52,"This is a really good car at this price. Good exterier, fantastic stereo, good power, 100000 miles/5 years limited warranty, etc. A lot of good things. I love this car. Although somebody told me the interior is not good, I chose the light interior, and it is really great.",4
53,I love this car; but triple with the white arm rest is whacked. Could get a little better gas mileage.,3
54,"Just about everything about this car is great, at the price paid it should be. It does have a few shortcomings, the trunk lid closes like a piece of tin. The dealer said nothing can be done about it and the back bumper where it fits along the side is a poor fit. Overall the car is joy to drive.",3
55,"I drive carpool on the highway everyday (a little tight inside, but oh well) and not so much city anymore. I've only gotten below 30 mpg in the city once, and have gotten over 38 on the highway. My usually get around 34-35 combined. I opted not to get a hybrid as it was not going to be as cost efficient for me as the regular Civic. It's not the best accelerator when pulling onto the highway, but then again I traded in my Odyssey (which I loved but could no longer afford to feed) and I smile every time I stop at the gas station.",3
56,"This is a cool car. Traded a Dodge Ram Laramie 4X4 Quad cab for it. Didn't lose much on interior room, doubled my gas milage. Used to jump in my wifes SAAB 9-3 convertible every chance I had before. Not anymore. I like this big, powerful, roomy car. Thus the AvaRooom... roomy and vrooom!!! Lots of compliments on the desert sand mica color scheme. By the way, I did test drive a Lexus ES350. Using the extra money for my kids college tuition. Maintenance is very inexpensive as well. For the most part change oil and rotate tires every 5K miles.",4
57,"If slot cars could be full scale this might be it. Steering is right on, just point where you want it to go. Suspension is firm but does not beat you up. Transmission is a blast with the engine being eager all the time. Relaxed when you want it to be, fun when you need it to be. Roomier inside than you'd think.",4
58,This has been a great car for the past year. Very clean look and feels great on the road.,4
59,"I am very disappointed with this purchase, paint has been chipping and continues to bubble on pieces that had been repainted noise in front sounds like needing new breaks this was all in 3 months of purchasing. Headlights had to be completely replaced, washer fluid leaks on hood, tie down in back fell off and again paint bubbling all with in 6 months of owning vehicle. If own the lt sage, please go over it and check for bubbles of pin head paint. It squeaks like an old truck on very hot days and long rides in stop and go traffic, does not have pickup, the dash color reflects on the windshield which is somewhat distracting. Never will I purchase a Mazda.",0
60,"So far, this has been a wonderful car. It is our 4th Saturn since 1997 and is the best so far. Ride is suprisingly quiet and smooth. Handling is ""sporty"" and with the longer wheel base takes the bumps in the road with little notice of the passengers. Workmanship is typical Saturn quality (this is a positive statement)and the only issue was OnStar didn't work out of the showroom but was resolved within a week of purchase. All in all, its Saturn's best to date and it turns heads (we purchased black on black leather). My wife and I argue over who will drive it, she wins during the week and I get it on the weekends.",3
61,I drove all the comparable cars in this class and I fell in love with the styling and interior of the civic. The front seats have plenty of leg room and I love the digital speedometer close to the windshield.,4
62,"I think the Altima is a good quality product and you get a lot of car for the money; however, I have some issues with it. Most importantly, the exterior of the car crinkles very easily (per auto body mechanic). I had a plastic empty shopping car 3 inches away from the car. It rolled into my car and made a ding. I hope I never get into an accident! I also had a problem with my TPMS light malfunctioning. Also, there is a terrible blind spot when you back up from parking spaces. My sister-in-law has the same problem with her Altima. It's either the back of the car is too high or it's the fact there isn't a good visual field from inside the car. not enough window. Very dangerous.",2
63,"I had owned a 97 Ford Explorer for 8 years and put 250,000 miles on it. I have been looking for a good quality, highly reliable, comfortable SUV and all roads and research led me to purchase an 08 Ford Edge. I had been researching for 6 months, looking at Chevy, Honda, Lincoln, Toyota Highlander, and GMC Acaidia. I decided on the Edge because it met all the requirements of what I wanted in my next vehicle. I average 25 - 30,000 miles a year, so relibility, comfort, interior room and gas mileage were all important factors. I have driven it 4,400 miles now and have been averaging 19.9 miles/gallon overall. Congrats to Ford! I would highly recommend the Edge to anyone looking for a new SUV.",4
64,I purchased my first Honda after doing much research on the fuel economy of cars. I bought it new with six miles on it and have had problems with it drifting to the right. I have had it in four times already. First time they did a front end alignment which had failed. It still pulled to the right. Returned that day and they switched tires from rear to front and said it was a radial pull and they put all new tires on it. It continues to drift and now they are telling me it is the road and all Hondas drift to the right. It never pulls left. They also scratched my paint up on the visit with their complimentary wash. Very unhappy!!!,0
65,"I have my XTerra now almost 1.5 years, and I never regret buying it. However, I think, the dealership ripped me off a bit. The car is fun to drive, just a bit hard over bumps in the road. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with back problems. I frequently drive long distances, and It's a bit tough on gas mileage, which is even worse in the city. One tank filling lasts about 360 highway miles. The air condition is o.k., but not great during the hot season in Louisiana. Features, that I miss: The tank is not lockable, and the dealer told me not to buy a lockable tank lid, because this would not seal properly. The antenna can't be pushed in. The sound system is awful.",2
66,"We replace a car for this truck, and so far just love it, we have 5000 miles on it. Looked at the Tacoma but this was a lot more truck for the money. We have the SE pkg and 4 wheel drive. Gives you a very nice ride. Gas mileage was a little low till we put on the Bakflip cover and that improved mileage 25% to 30%. Well worth the money for the cover. Will pay for itself.",3
67,"I've had my Cobalt a little over a year now, its a fun little car, but ii was expecting more from it. I added new rims/tires and a new exhaust because the appearance was somewhat plain. The inside looks really cheap, Chevy needs a major upgrade on the interior. I have yet to see the mileage Chevy says it gets, a little frustrating. I'd say its a good beginner car, but not really able to compete with other cars in the same category, it just falls short.",1
68,"Just bought this car in April...love it!!! Great price, style, and comfort what better car to buy for your money. I think everyone should own one!!",4
69,"The Aura is a very comfortable vehicle. My previous car has a 2006 Honda Accord. The Aura is mor comfortable, quieter, and gets the same gas mileage. For the money I think it is a better car than the Honda Accord.",4
70,"I don't spend a lot of time on the road, but when I drive, I love to drive this SUV. It handles like a car, and is easy to get in and out of tight spaces. Internal cargo space is good, with enough seating flexibility to carry larger items. It gets good mileage, and has enough power under the hood for all driving needs.The seating area is flexible and comfortable. Over all, I am extremely satisfied with my Honda CR-V, and I know I will get years of reliable performance from it.",4
71,"We have owned everything from Porches, BMWs, Mercedes, and Corvettes and this is by far the best car. The combination of power and luxury is unbeatable. The looks of this car are stunning with the AMG package. Not to mention a hand-built engine that is to die for. The price for this car is a little on the high side for the market but in comparison to the M6, it is an overall better car. Highly recommend for any high performance car enthusiast, it will be a nice treat.",4
72,I love love love my ridge. A solid frame and body construction can you say stronger than yours the avalanche doesn't compare I've driven both and that Honda is the better I've only got 300 mi on mine and I'm getting 14.7 mpg in town that beats out most trucks after the break in period I love the exterior looks and it is extremely comfortable I bought the bottom of the line to save $$$ how many trucks out there have all the engineering and safety features on the bottom trim level that they have on the top Honda,4
73,"Quality and craftmanship are the norms in this new 2008 E Class. Bluetooth should standard, rather than being required to purchase a connection module. Upgrading to P2 package well worth the investment. Handles exceptionally at high speeds, as well as cornering. The sport model is also a plus. Pick up and performance is excellent.",4
74,"This car, so far, has impressed us with the acceleration, comfort and overall good looks. We got rid of a SUV, and this is a great alternative. In Southern Italy where we live, it isn't uncommon for people to drive quite fast(80-100 MPH/130-160 KPH) yet this car keeps up with them all. The styling is top notch and is the best in it's class. We bought the V50 2.4, Grey metallic with dark beige interior premium sound with 12 speakers. Wow!!. Awesome! We have 3 daughters ages 13, 6 and 1 year and they all fit well even with a car seat.We looked at several other Euro wagons and this Volvo tops them all.",4
75,"I have owned my civic for 10 months, it has been very, very good to me. It has the typical 3rd gear issue, but if you go to the dealership with this (08-020) Service bulletin they will fix it free of charge. I average about 28 mpg in NYC which is great. In Ohio i was getting closer to 40 mpg on the highway. The MPG is better then my co-workers smart car, and it is much better looking as well. It has terrible blind spots, and the factory head lights are terrible. The stock radio is ""ok"" and replacing it is a nightmare. But for a stock car at the 20 grand mark. There is nothing more fun, or better to drive. It can use some more torque.",3
76,"Overall, a great car for its price. Can't get a hard top that seats 4 from anywhere else. Like the title says, you'll be turning some heads when you lower the top at a signal. It's not built for performance though... looks sporty but really isn't.",3
77,"The 2007 Volkswagen Passat 2.0T has excellent all around functionality, a great feel, great design and it gets good gas mileage too.",4
78,"This car is without a doubt to me, the best car for a family currently on the market (for those who are non-minivan lovers). The driver and passenger feel like they are in a luxury car, while the kids feel like they are in a roomy minivan-like environment, with a DVD player, 110V outlet for the x-box, and easy in and out due to the lower than most SUV's ground clearance. Our 3 year old can easily get in and out himself. Overall, it's a fantastic car that is fun to drive yet has all the features that a busy family is looking for.",4
79,"There are better choices out there, unless you want AWD with traction and stability control and great gas mileage. What other AWD vehicle gets better than 24/30 mpg? 145 hp does not make this a sports car, but you can safely merge into traffic and keep up. In bad weather, you can pass almost everyone on the road. The list of features on the Sport model is impressive. At less than $17,000, I will not nitpick. I also own a 2006 Aerio SX Premium.",3
80,"The Altima coupe has the best-looking backend of any car out there at any price. Look at it from the rear and a little to the side and its a joy to behold. The 4 cylinders get you up to speed without even trying. Back seat has more headroom (slightly) than the Scion tC and Civic coupe -- but a 6-footer's head might touch the rear window. Not sure about mileage. I'm still on the first tank, but it seems fairly decent. Front seats are very comfortable, with good driver's lumbar support. Driver's leg compartment is more comfortable than Civic coupe, where the parking hand brake bothered my knee, and more spacious than the Mazda 3 sedan that crowded my lower leg. A lot of quality for the money.",3
81,"This is a wonderful car for the price. At about 13,000 you can't expect much. The Yaris is like a a good $5 hamburger, it's good, but it's not a filet mignon. For the price, I feel this is the best car out there. I did a lot of shopping before buying and am very pleased with it. For a while I was a little iffy, but then I got the windows tinted and it looks way better, especially since I got a dark blue color. Dark cars need dark windows. This was my first car.",4
82,"I have owned several MB before, but this one is a car that stands uo to a BMW in ride, and size. The performance is excellence as well as the handling. My car has two option the i-pod in the glove box a waste for me, but not my kids. Also the optional headlamps which are great for lighting your way. I strongly suggest this option for older folks, it help alot. So far the car is great, and the fuel economy is not bad either in the upper 20's combine with city and highway. This car is a lot for the buck, and truely a great value. This car car hums like a bimmer, and rides like a tank as a Mercedes should be.",4
83,I recently had a problem with car such that the a/c was blowing only hot air. A trip to dealer showed an undiscovered leak in the refrigerant from the system. They were unable to find the leak after 4 hours and have placed a dye in the refrigerant to try to find the 'pin hole' leak. I've never had this problem with a Japanese vehicle. Has anyone else experienced this problem? I now am supposed to drive the car for 3 months and return the vehicle for 'discovery' of the leak.,1
84,"At first we loved this car, then the problems started. I've had it in twice for doors leaking from sunroof drain tubes, going to take it again soon. Seats are ruined from water damage. Have had the strut mounts replaced, windshield wiper blades recalled, can't seem to get the popping noises fixed underneath. We are very upset, also the car won't even make it up our driveway because of the gravels. It stinks for a front wheel drive! wish we never traded. I feel like we have been cheated. This car is a lemon!!",0
85,"All around solid, dependable truck. Daily driver, 75 highway miles/day. Average 20-22 MPG. Traded an '03 Dodge Dakota for it, and what a difference. Not all good, sadly. As some have said here, the brakes are horrible and Toyota should be ashamed of them. The peppy 4.0L V6 makes the 3.9 in the Dakota seem like a 4 cylinder however, with excellent torque and high end power. Ride is good... it's a truck, after all. Much more comfortable than the Dodge, and I love the dash/control layout. Once I wear out the atrocious stock Dunlop tires and replace with something decent handling will be great.",2
86,"This is my third Miata, and I've had one from each generation. Mazda has taken a great car and made it even better. The car remains lightweight and agile but adds horsepower and more refined ergonomics. I have a wide frame and fit much better in this car than in previous generations. The engine is super smooth, the manual transmission has a short throw and shifts easily, and new alternatives like xenon headlights improve refinement. I had a Porsche Boxster S between my last Miata and this one. After I sold the Porsche I wanted another two seat convertible without spending $50k+. Even though the Porsche is faster and gets better skidpad ratings, the Miata is a better value. Great car",4
87,It is the most uncomfortable car I have driven. I am at a little over 600 miles and only getting 25 mpg on the hwy! I did months of research and THOUGHT i was making a wise buying decision. I won't buy another.,0
88,I find you get alot for your money but I've had my car only a year and 6 months and already had the left front and the right front axle changed along with a door handle that fell of an interior passenger visor. I also had to have my ac panel changed because of peeling and now I'm awaiting a passenger door lock controller and a front right head light. It makes me wonder how much I'm going to have to spend after the 2 YEAR warranty if I will have to bear these frequent visits to the garage without even being in an accident and owning a new car. I would suggest a different car. I'm think of the new Audi cross over Hyundia. By the way I hate the unsteady cup holders an cheap old fashion ac vents.,1
89,"I was dead set on a BMW 3 series, but I thought the price was a bit much for a car without power tilt. I looked around and finally came across the G35. I drove from Reno, NV to Roseville, CA to test drive it. After driving out of the parking lot I was sold. I've had the car since 17 May 2007 and I absolutely love it! The power is beyond what I wouldv'e imagined. Handling is superb. The sound system is great! For $10k less than the BMW I wanted, I could not ask for a better car!",4
90,"I love this car. Candidates: M3, 911, S4. The highway is not a race track. No do I have to endure the harshness of my 996 to have neck breaking speed and a boat load of ""cool factor"". This thing is a serious wolf in sheeps clothing. The power, torque and hp, is amazing. The ride is plush, more body roll than my Porsche and BMW, even with the sport suspension, but I got over it quick enough. It is still well composed in the twisties. I am waiting for my H&R lowering springs to arrive and for $600 the body roll be gone. Cops don't even notice it. Great car! Of course it eats tires and gas, but a car with 386 ft #s of torque should!",3
91,"This late manufactured 2007 vehicle is a love to drive! Unless your clothing can be rolled up or a wear & toss type, trunk space is limited as is the 3 cups holder. Driving with the top down did not hamper conversation even at 80 mph. I had the most problems with the automatic phone connection due my accent! I've ordered a 2008 turbo therefore if this vehicle had not met my expectations and more, I would not continue to be a Saturn Sky owner. Very easy to drive and shifting never did present a problem.",4
92,"My husband & I are in our 60s and it took a day to get used to the center dash and now we much prefer it. No lights glaring in your face at night, handy glovebox at all times. We had a Volkswagon GTI which my husband loved for its power and handling. If this had the power, it would be as much fun, however, it has plenty of power for the size and gas usage. No trouble getting up to speed to merge on interstates, which was a concern.",4
93,"This is a great little car. Not only is it fun to drive (I have the 5 speed manual) but I get looks everywhere I go. And it's so big inside! Tons of room! I only have 675 miles on it so far, but have averaged 27.5 miles per gallon in mixed city/hwy driving, which is a far cry from the 10-12 MPG I was getting in my F150. Build quality is better than I've seen in other cars in its price range, and I looked at a lot before I drove this one. If you're looking for a lower priced, gas sipping, fun to drive car, you should really check out the Scion xB. You'll love it!",4
94,"Until I got to the dealership, I had never heard of a Yaris. 2 hours and much test driving later, I would not have bought anything else! The interior space and comfort are incredible for this size of vehicle. I love the extra room with the fold down rear seat. Better gas mileage was my ultimate goal. After feeding a Trailblazer every 5 or 6 days I am looking forward to seeing the gas pumps 2 times per month! Excellent vehicle that I have an will continue to recommend!",4
95,"I've had this car for 2yrs now and overall I truly love it. I have it in pearl white w/ black leather interior and it looks great. The HIDs are awesome and the handling is top notch. The lights in the dashboard look nice (blue white and red) & are bright. The leather bucket seats are comfortable for me (I'm 5'4)and there is plenty of room inside. Driving feels extremely smooth and breaking is great. This is my first car and I'm scared to try a new one b/c I might be disappointed. I prefer the '08 model over the '09 simply b/c the exterior look can't be beat. I love this car & I don't want to give it up next yr when my lease is over. I recommend it to all who love a fun, safe, & reliable car!",4
96,"This is a great highway cruiser - if you travel long distances, this is a great way to get there cheaply. 43 mpg on the 1st fill-up, I expect more when it breaks in completely. Rented a Prius (got 44 mpg with it) and shopped one as well - the Civic stickers for less, Honda is dealing on the sticker price, and you still get $1050 in cash back from the Feds - what's not to like? The Prius is a nice car, this is less expensive and equally as nice. I like the ""normal"" Civic look as opposed to the unique design of the Prius. The Prius has a bit more room inside, and I like the fold down back seats and rear space. The Honda can carry 850 lbs (pass + cargo) the Prius 800 lbs.",4
97,"Great car. Bought premium, sport, and nav packages. Didn't really want iPod kit or xenon headlights but love that I got them. Wanted iDrive more for computer control of functions than for GPS but like the GPS capability, especially searching for nearby businesses. More sport than others I considered, such as Merc-300 sport, Audi A4 & A6. You will feel the road, corners and bumps so if you drive bad roads take that into consideration. Corners great and acceleration is plenty for most. Standard sound system is great for my non-audiofile ears.",3
98,I was driving a Maxima for some time and wanted a change. I was convinced to buy American when I really didn't want too. If I knew then what I know now I would never have gotten this Buick LaCrosse. This Buick has been to the dealership 5 times for ONE problem; something with the steering column. I was given an extended warranty by Buick but that did not work. It's still not working right. The car is going back for round six and the SAME ISSUE. I am never going with American cars again. Thanks Buick for making such great American products. HA,0
99,"Well, this is my first VW and if it is reliable, it will not be my last. I picked out the Black w/black interior for my wife and to hand down to my daughter in a couple of years, but I have to admit, I look for reasons to drive the car. It handles great and gives good road feedback. Updated 2.5 engine has plenty of power for my taste.",4
100,This is the first car I've owned in which I can control the fuel economy. I love the leather interior: it makes the car look luxurious. The modern styling is super cool. The optional JBL 6 CD stereo could be better; the sound quality is not that great.,3
101,"I really like this car. I have a 2005 Elantra and I am amazed at the differences. Both are excellent autos, but I really like the classy feel to my new 2008. She gets great gas mileage, good on the roads, and just overall a very comfortable car.",4
102,"I've had my car for about 3 months now and have enjoyed every minute of it. I've been waiting for several year to get it and it was worth the wait. This was the design I wanted, so I had to go after it before the redesign hits next year. The 6M is very smooth and easy to use. All the interior controls and navigation system are easily accessible and easy to use. The seats are very comfortable, although a little snug compared to a regular passenger car. The head and legroom are excellent. The car is a blast to drive and the exhaust note is very cool.",4
103,"This is a blast to drive. The body style is outstanding, we added the Toyota rear spoiler, and get lots of positive comments from people. Right now we are getting combined City/Hwy 41 miles per gallon. The car drives smooth- has plenty of power. I was crusing on the Hwy yesterday at 70 mph and geting 42.5 miles per gallon. The ride and handling are outstanding. Everytime we stop someone walks up and wants to know how we like it, when we tell them we are getting 40 plus it knocks their socks off. This car makes driving fun again and economical.",4
104,I just purchased by 2007 Corolla LE and am quite impressed by the ride and the quality of the interior design. Smooth and janty ride with good pick up for an automatic.,4
105,"Wish I had the V6. However, I got a great performing 162hp 4 cyl. w/ excellent MPG and price paid was below invoice. Cost savings offset my preference of V6. I must be a performance oriented driver. 2nd wish: Stiffer suspension. I'm not looking for stiff suspension. I would prefer variable rate resistance that increases when the springs and shocks reach compression. It would improve cornering on rounded on-ramps. Interior noise levels could be quieter. Depending on road surface, noisier than expected on anything but smooth surface roadways. Still, satisfactory. Overall, a GREAT car. The foregoing are acceptible consequences of car's budget orientation. Terrific car!Happy overall.",3
106,Driving so far (2 months) has been great. My gas mileage on a 420 mile trip was 31.4 mpg. The only thing missing is Homelink controls for garage doors.,3
107,"This car is smoke and mirrors. It's slow, uncomfortable, gets poor gas mileage and is over priced. Paid 45K for a auto and have to tolerate 17 dummy phone switches because the car does not have bluetooth? Honestly, research BMW, Saab, Audi before buying this make. I'd return the car tomorrow if I could. Everyday I walk to this vehicle and wonder why I paid so much for a car with so little? Mercedes Benz must be making about 20 grand profit on each of these ""very, very average"" cars.",0
108,We purchased this vehicle as our last retirement vehicle. We needed a light duty pickup that has a 5000 lb. towing limit. I am 55 years old and wanted to be able tow our sports car around to shows and races. My bride had a few things that she wanted for her 1) comfort 2) passenger ability 3) resale 4) durability. So far we got it all from Honda Ridgeline,4
109,"Did plenty of research here and elsewhere before I ended up getting my Escape. Great vehicle! Do yourself a favor, get a K&N air filter, learn to feather the gas from stops and enjoy 23+ MPG in the city (with the V6 no less!) I get 26-28 Hwy. Use the cruise control, it's your fuel efficient friend! The Escape can be as much of a gas hog as you want it to be. The Audiophile System is awesome and a great perk. One of the best things I love about the Escape though is it's size. It's really nice to maneuver in tight spaces. I went from an F-150 to this so the maneuverability and double the MPG are greatly appreciated. My only real issue is there's no temp in the info center. Enjoy!",4
110,"I traded in my 2007 SLK that I had purchased new in March of 2007. It was a nice car, but tight on space and not very comfortable. The CLK Cabriolet is fantastic. The seats are the most comfortable I have set in ... even better than our 2008 Lexus LS 460. The Harmon Kardon stereo is incredible. The ride is crisp yet smooth and it literally glides over the roads. Some of the speakers vibrated at first with any significant bass, but this seems to have subsided quite a bit. The Irridium Silver paint is beautiful in lower light or artificial light, but in sunlight, you see the problems with the metallic paint...looks like it was painted with a spray can. Moral, don't buy on a cloudy day.",2
111,"I have had problems with this vehicle since the day we drove it home from the dealer. After 4 months of trying to deal with Nissan, we have yet to have anyone actually take responsibility to fix or replace this car. We have waited weeks for phone calls. We have a brand new car that we are afraid to drive and nobody seems to know how to fix it. Nissan is also ignoring the service dept at the dealership attempting to repair this car. Guess the next step is to hire a lawyer.",0
112,"Bought as a replacement as I wrecked my 07' saturn vue. 08' Lucerne CX was a dealer demo with approx. 2,400 miles on it. Started to hear a rattle/buzzing noise within the first month coming from the front end area. Brake lights stayed on until I went to the dealer for the repair. Dealer replaced a fuel line problem as there was a GM bulletin on that. To date, I have had the car in 5 times for the rattle and still rattles/buzzes. I'm ""disenchanted"" with this Buick. I'm going to try the rattle repair one more time.....then I'll contact GM personally. (They probably won't care/ or respond) Dealer has been sympathetic to my issue anyway. I'm going to buy Honda next time.",0
113,Being the last year of the Ranger I`m glad I ordered one when I did. I`ve been extremely pleased with this vehicle. It works exceptionally well in off-road conditions even with the factory street tires and gets me about 20 MPG on a trip. Regular gas is still the cheapest and it works well to deliver all the power I need.,4
114,After first month of owning this Enclave has been nothing but trouble. Since June 08 we have had two transmission software updates (tranny shifting still terrible. Acts as though it doesn't know what gear it's suppose to be in). Rear liftgate opens by itself (when car off luckily). With automatic operation turned off we still hear the lift motor engage. Heat controls stopped working twice. At times when driving all gauges read as though the car is turned off. With cruise control set at 75 MPH for nearly two hours the best MPG I get is 17. In city getting 13 MPG is a good day. Dealer is trying their best but I don't hold out for much improvement.,0
115,"It is even better than I expected. The interior is all of a piece, with those wonderful Volvo seats. The controls are similar to the last 2002 XC70 we had, rewarding the repeat customer. There is no flimsy dash mounted cupholder like the old XC70! The car seats 4 in absolute comfort. We had a way-back third seat in the old XC70, but not on this one, we almost never used it.",4
116,"My decision was between a Mercedes S550 4 matic sport and the Audi S8. The S550 is nice, but the S8 just felt like something more special. The v10 engine (smooth and quiet at normal speeds, and unbelievably poweful and ""baritone"" when you want it to be), and the special ""S"" interior and exterior felt like something a step above the norm. Even the ride (with the std 20 inch rims) is wonderful in comfort mode... unbelievable given the potholes in my part of the country). I average about 15.5 mpg (70% city/30% highway). Not great, but hey, that v10 power/noise has got to come from somewhere. Net, no regrets so far.",3
117,"We loved our 9 year old Venture but had to replace it. The Uplander LS lacks some of the comfort features we took for granted but it's a good follow-on. Missing are the swing out electric powered windows at the far rear as well as a front seat storage drawer and other storage spaces the Venture had. All the seats are not as wide or plush as the Venture but they're not bad. On the highway, it's quieter than the Venture and ours gets about 26 MPG. Around town, MPG is about the same. Handling is excellent and steering isn't overly sensitive and unforgiving like some SUVs I've driven. Van is great looking and a pleasure to drive.",3
118,"I have owned the X5 for only a year and twice now I encountered a parking brake malfunction. The first time this happened was on Thanksgiving day! Had to get the SUV towed from the gas station, manual hand brake feature would not work. Just today, just went to buy groceries and the parking brake malfunction went on again! Had to wait for tow truck for over 2hrs. No other options but to have SUV towed. Very inconvenient! And have to wait until Monday for dealership to open! Even more inconvenient! Other than this, had to change 2 tires twice due to nail punctures, run flats cannot be patched, spent over $1000! Changed one tire, SUV not even a month old! Not safe for long drives! DO NOT BUY!",0
119,"Got tired of paying BMW maintenance and traded in my '01 525i for a white EX-L sedan this past weekend. I am very impressed with the build quality and the handling. The leather interior interior has a high quality feel and should last a long time. The stock stereo has a nice full sound. I did compare it to the Mazda 3 S Grand Touring Sedan and despite what the specs say, the Civic EX-L feels larger inside from a front and rear leg room perspective. I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it over the Mazda 3 and the Corolla.",4
120,"Good car. Seating could be more comfortable, mileage has averaged around 35.",3
121,"I recently totalled my '02 Pathfinder and settled on the Matrix. I like the seats but the door's arm-rest does not accommodate my long arms. The vehicle was a good choice for me after considering a lot of other vehicles, it was the best overall purchase for the money.",3
122,"I have a 9 year old Nissan Maxima that I recently gave to my son. Only has 160,000 miles on it. I purchased in it's place a 2008 Nissan Altima with the SL Package. So far with 2800 miles I am very well satisfied. Doesn't curb as well as the Maxima but for the difference in the Price, I can live with it. I'm getting about 30 miles to the gallon on average.",3
123,"It looks like a mundane family hauler, but handles and drives like a sports car if you get on the gas. The 3.5 engine is so powerful, and the CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) is very smart and seems to read your mind. If you just cruise around town, the CVT keeps the engine revs low to save gas, but if you give it more throttle, it quickly lets the engine spin up (no shift lag) and it MOVES. When shifted ""manually"" the CVT shifts very quickly through the preset 6 speeds. Can feel bumps with the SE vs SL (luxury) version, but it's a reasonable trade-off for larger wheels, better shocks and stiffer anti-roll (sway) bars. Steering a bit numb, but sticks well in curves. I love it!",3
124,"With over 17,000 miles on my Rainier, there have been zero problems with the vehicle. I purchased the Rainier because the seats in my 2004 LeSabre were so uncomfortable my wife could not ride in it for any distance, even though we had zero problems with it over 85,000 miles and still experienced 32 mpg on the highway and 22 in my commute to work. The Rainier's ride is great, wind noise in minimal, seating comfort is perfect (I'm 6'4"" and my wife is 5'6""), and the towing and carrying flexibility are outstanding. While the mpg averages are less than the LeSabre, I still average slightly over 22 mpg on the highway and a little over 15 mpg commuting to work. This was Buick's best kept secret!",4
125,"Love it, first BMW, traded in 300 srt8 and so far only positive things to say about BMW. Not as fast as srt but it has enough punch to snap your head back. It handles simple amazing. Expensive but still less then MB cabrio and performance of MB is not even close unless you get AMG. The small trunk has plenty of space. Highly recommend!",4
126,Was circling the M45 but didn't need all that car (no kids etc) so the BMW 335i was the first car then the G followed - the G is far better value with no sacrifice in performance under 99% of driving - and it brakes and comes off the line far better,3
127,"Just got it so here are 1st thoughts. I've wanted a 2-seater since I was 12 and saw an MG midget parked outside. Finally got the Miata. Great, just great! Have read all reviews posted so far and agree with most. Great fun to drive. Great performance. Ingenious power hard top terrific option if you like the look and live in a climate where you'd like to extend the season (I do). I looked at all the other cars in a similar price range and there is simply no comparison. Others look and feel almost primitive vs. Miata. If you are thinking about the auto- transmission make sure you test the 6- speed also -- AT works well but it gives a totally different driving experience and feel. Get one & enjoy!",4
128,"I've owned 10 p/us prior to the Tundra and I can honestly say this is the best p/u I've owned to date!! Power, comfort, styling, reliability, etc. Fuel mileage is a bit bad but it is in fact a truck w/huge eng. I work hard for my money so when I spend 30K + I want the best and most reliable available wouldn't anyone?? Toyota's track record speaks for itself! Drive them all and I think you'll be taking home the Tundra! Nuff said!",4
129,"I bought my Kia by trading in my Nissan Armada. I was commuting on weekends from my home in Dallas to my parents in Jacksonville, Tx. I went from $65 in gas to $40 and also about 4 more days before I had to fill up. My son has plenty of room in the backseat in his carseat with his books, crayons, and DVDs. The Armada was so high, I always had to open the door for him. Now, he gets on in. I do contract work for a florist and the easels fit nicely. I make arrangements in my home and I have plenty of room to put everything. The engine is very quiet, it handles great in the rain. I love my Sorento!",4
130,"Looking at the most fuel-efficient choices out there, I naturally settled on the Prius and Civic Hybrid (and held onto a secret wish for a Mazda 3 hatchback that could get 40 on the highway). The Prius had an appealing zen-like quality to it, but it just wasn't comfortable for someone my size (6'3""). Acknowledging my natural Hondaphile leanings, I drove the HCH (with some reservations over the supposedly ""underwhelming"" performance). After that, it was a no-brainer. It accelerates more than well, never once leaving me with that sinking, sluggish feeling. Add to that comfortable seats and billet-like build quality, and I feel I got a premium-class car with 45 mpg for $21.5K. Very happy.",4
131,"I bought the 50th Anniversary Edition. Overall I like it (now 2.5K miles). Traded BMW X5 SAV 3.0i; wanted to drive green. Averaging 29-32 in town, depending on how hard I accelerate; 36-42 on freeway. It does promote one to drive better. Disappointed in lack of Toyota quality - rattle in dash; ill-fitting door bits. Now dealerships (all in my area) have no moldings or spoilers available for after market, because of Anniversary Edition. Very annoying.",2
132,"I've had the wagon for about six months now and it's a good car. I haven't had any problems to speak of. The seats are firm, but not the most comfortable, I could drag a house down the street with this thing, but won't any races, and my mileage is excellent (avg. 21mpg hwy/cty), all typical of a diesel. That said, everything electric about it is inferior to the domestic wagons. The power lift- gate is slow and doesn't always close, the nav. is a pain to use and slow in responding, the rain sensing wipers typically do what they want, even on a sunny day, and the front parking ""see dead people"" and want to warn me about it. If you're thinking about a 4wd wagon, check out the Flex, cool & cheap.",3
133,"Just purchased the 535xi. It's the best car I have ever driven. I have owned Mercedes, Infiniti and Acura and is far superior in quality and craftsmanship. The car is fun to drive, quite on the road, accelerates quickly with the 300HP turbo. Within two hours, you can master the iDrive. It's not as difficult as made out to be. Just have to go through a few more steps than other systems. I would highly recommend this car. The money is worth it when compared to others in the same price range.",4
134,"This is a great car. I love the 2- tone cocoa/cashmire interior and the ambient lighting. The car handles the curvey New England roads extremely well and I averaged 36 MPG on my first long road trip! XM radio is great, although I probably won't renew the subscription after the free trial. I love the clean lines on the exterior and the dual-cockpit design on the interior. The interior is extremely quiet and the build quality is on par with anything else in it's class. The trunk is large enough to hold my golf clubs and ice hockey bag and still have some room to squeeze stuff in. If you are looking for a great car in this segment you should definitely check out the Malibu.",4
135,i love driving our new sonata. it has a smooth ride and plenty of powerv when you need it . i also like the new stle change,4
136,"5000kms on my 08 Nitro R/T and if I given the choice I would do it again. Fuel economy improves with every tank, styling is unique in a sea of rolling eggs. Infinity stereo is awesome, slide and go storage is great. While cross shopping this vehicle I wound the imports to be thousands more for less performance. 2 thumbs up.",4
137,"This is our 2nd Highlander. My wife and I liked the 2001 so much, that we decided to buy the 2007 before the upcoming redesign. The size and practicality is perfect for our family. We live in upstate NY, so 4 wheel drive is important, but the vehical never goes off road so we don't need a heavy 4x4 SUV. The Highlander meets all of our needs.",4
138,"I was a Dodge guy for years until I got sick of replacing brakes and front ends every 10,000 miles. I've had my Tundra for just over a year, and it's by far the best truck I've ever owned. It's fast, smooth, reliable, and eagerly takes on any weather the Northeast can dish out. I will never buy another brand again. As long as Toyota makes the Tundra, I'll own one.",4
139,My first hybrid. We have two Fords and two Nissans and a Mazda. The leather is wonderful and it looks great. The side air bags gives you a feel of safety. Wish Ford would have better map lighting up front. My daughter was cold about the truck as she drives a 2006 Nissan Maxima. Took her five minutes to warm up to the two tone paint and leather. Truck is a little top heavy but my wife loves it. Averaging over 40 miles per gallon. Notice that resale value is in the Honda area. Great storage for a small SUV. Taking it up North for winter break to check long term driving. Ford's better idea,3
140,As an owner I say it is a very sporty and classy car with a lot of power and is smooth to drive. I'll recommend this car to anyone!,4
141,"My wife and I test drove everything out there $5K above and below the price of the Versa and were hard pressed to find anything that truly compared. Leg, head and foot room are amazing in both the front and rear seats and the ride is that of a car two classes higher. Ride noise is minimal at worst and handling is better than most in this size group. The car was suppose to be a third car, one my wife could use to show clients properties way out of town, but has quickly become the vehicle of choice for the first one out of the house in the morning. If you're considering a Fit, Civic, Corolla, Matrix, Focus or anything of the such, give the Versa a try and see the value for yourself.",4
142,"Traded in a 2005 Turbo Diesel for the Hybrid. Best decision I've made in a long time. Actually got 41 miles to the gallon in the city yesterday. Quite a difference from fifteen. I'll never buy anything but a hybrid again. Love the Ford, totally impressed, get one.",4
143,"Picked this up last month. Got it at invoice since the car market is slow and 2009 models are coming. VERY impressed with the car. Drove every hybrid out there and thought the RX400h would be the one but there is really no comparison between the two. The RX is an older, noisier, less luxurious ride than the Highlander and, interestingly, very few people realize that. That may change in 2010 with the new RXh. This Highlander really excels in many areas. Mileage around town has been 26.5 mpg-better than we read here. It is very quiet and the intelligence of the interior layout is impressive. This is my wife's car and she's coming from a Lexus LS430 Ultra and she is more than satisfied.",4
144,"This is the best vehicle I have driven. It is a smooth ride. I have a big family and there is enought room for all my four children. The interior is very stylish, I especially like the white stitching on the black leather interior. It is very comfortable.",4
145,"I just traded my 05 Tib on this SE model and I very happy with it. Looks, drive, and reasonable fuel mileage add up to a great ride.",3
146,"We have been looking into getting a new car for a while now and we were blown away by the Rabbit. The look of the interior and exterior are great and it has way more standard features than expected. There are so many little features and neat things about this car that I feel like a salesperson every time I tell someone about it! The ride is comfortable and smooth for a car its size. It has a ton of room inside to fit four people comfortably. It handles really nicely and has a lot of power. It shifts really smoothly and quickly for being an automatic and the Tiptronic is fun to have (even though I don't really use it all that often). Seriously, this is an incredibly fun car to drive!",4
147,"My husband and I have owned ours now for three weeks and it is the best Jeep we ever owned. We have had Jeeps all our lives from the years of 1977, 1986, 1993, 1999, and 2002.This Jeep is a smooth ride, handles very well, almost like my Eagle Talon TSi all wheel drive I owned in my early 20's. Not as luxurious as my 2003 Suburban Z71, but I didn't order it with that expectation. It actually came darn close. Who wants leather and plush seats in a convertible that is expected to get wet. Can't do that with my Suburban. Simply put, we love it and it is a better ride than a 2001 Cherokee and larger than one. The new Jeep is so quiet you cannot even hear or feel the engine idle or shift up or down when driving. We got 23.5 mpg with three kids, a 55 lb dog, a cat, me, my hubby and our cage with clothes on back. Awesome what more can I say!",4
148,"It took a while for us to drive a bunch of the SUVs closely resembling the Highlander. Before test driving several vehicles I had already sold myself on an Acadia. After the test drive the obvious winners were the 2009 Pilot and Toyota Highlander. We had looked at the Highlander a couple of years back but it was smaller and the dash was just plain ugly. The new redesign and the plush drive just did us both in. The Pilot would have offered a little more room but the dash looks like its made out of cheap plastic, and unless you get the all black interior the two tone effect was not very appealing to us. We have a family of 4 so we can leave the third row down and use when needed.",3
149,I love this SUV. I had a jeep and traded for this for fuel economy. I averaged over 26 mph on a 1000 mile trip. I don't like the excess engine noise when cold. Seats are hard but for a smaller person comfortable. Performance is better than Pontiac gt with 3.8. Some wind noise but have a Lexus also and it's quiet. Great steering response in the mountains where I live. Corners not a problem. I got a lifetime drivetrain warranty from the dealer for free as long as he does the service.,3
150,"This Acura TL is a step up from a fully-loaded 2003 Accord V6 that I previously drove, and wife continues to love it despite 320,000 km on it (bought it brand new!). So far, I've had very little regret from choosing it over Audi A4 and Lexus IS 250. The car drives beautifully, esp. on the highway! This car gets the most bang for your bucks!",4
151,"Not as luxurious at the Infiniti G, not as sporty as the BMW 3 series and not as reliable as the IS350. Purchased it because it was priced the best out of all 3. The other 3 cars had too much power and were too expensive. This car isn't on par with the other 3, but you get what you pay for.",2
152,I am so happy with it. The Edge is just so much fun to drive. I'm not real sure about the gas mileage because I'm still on my first tank of gas but I was previously driving a Windstar so I can only believe it will be about the same or better! I love the power that the Edge has. The body style is absolutely gorgeous! My Edge is the Creme Brulee color - it looks very classy.,4
153,"We had been looking for some time at what to buy, we had setled on a rendevoux, realized they discontinued, looked at the XL7 and drove it, bought it and wife and I love it. Black with leather, can always find something wrong with anything if ya look hard enough, but for the money, we are very happy.",3
154,My Mustang GT is so fun to drive! The interior is very comfortable and classy and the ambient lighting is just plain cool. I am most impressed by the driving experience. Such quick response and smooth ride. Absolutely a blast to drive!,4
155,"I absolutely love my SRX! I looked at these for two years before finally taking the plunge with a 2007 V6 with the third row power folding seat. I wasn't sure I really wanted an SUV since I had driven a luxury sedan for years, but the transition was effortless. My husband wanted me to get the Ecalade but I felt that was just too big but the SRX is perfect! The ride is wonderful, and I have no problem parking and turning like you can have with other large SUV's.",4
156,"I just graduated high school, and was looking at a lot of cars from Toyota to Mazda to Chevy. i finally found the Hyundai Elantra.Searching all over for the SE was crazy. if ur looking for an SE good luck finding one. The warranty is the best. The car is quiet and has a lot of room. the trunk is huge! the Elantra also gets very good gas, i have a 136 miles already and not even a half a tank.",4
157,"I looked around and it did not take me long to make a decision in buying this vehicle. I have encountered the same difficulty in clearing my leg from the steering wheel when entering the cabin but in general, Toyota you have come a long way in design and performance in this category. Fuel mileage should improve.",3
158,"I am so happy with my choice for the Acadia. I looked at Lexus, Acura MDX, Honda Pilot, and related vehicles. This Acadia has it all over the foreigners. I am proud that I can support my own country now, and have a great vehicle.",4
159,"New for '08, it's exhaust is tuned to rumble. It's too noisy on acceleration, and constantly hums in the rear compartment. I have an '07 S550 which gets 26.6 mpg on the highway. This S63 gets 18 mpg if you keep the speed at 70. Otherwise, mileage drops dramatically. Acceleration is awesome. The car starts out as a jack rabbit and turns into a missle. Before you know it, you're doing 60 mph in a 30 speed zone, and 90 in a 65. The interior is a superb improvement over the last generation. The dash is beautiful. The COMAND has 4 ways to get to a function making it user friendly.",3
160,"If you're looking for an inexpensive ride that's great on gas, the Kia Rio is all you need! I bought the 4 door base to use as my ""run around"" car and I am getting 39 MPG based on about a 60% stop-and-go and 40% highway driving ratio. It's the best no frills car out there, easily the best bang for the buck. I never thought I'd buy a Kia/Hyundai, but with gas prices being what they are and just needing some basic wheels, this car hits the target dead on!",4
161,"I purchased this car a week ago, what a fun car to drive! It handled extremely well in the snow, AWD is great. I love the leather seats, smart key, radio. Paddle shifters are fun. Handles unbelievably!! However, the experience that has been awsome in everyway was dissipated when i found out that several nav system available while the car is parked become inaccessible when the car is in motion. In the name of safety according to lexus. If I were to agree that lexus can be my mother, I resent paying $2600 for a system that is literally crippled in my mind when the vehicle is motion. Save yourselves the money get the car without nav and by a $100 3rd party nav system instead.",2
162,"The Lexus is a fair car but way overrated. The Navigational system does not allow the driver or passenger to make adjustments while the vehicle is in motion. Lexus refuses to acknowledge this design issue and stonewalls its customers...so much so that owners are talking about class action litigation. If you must buy this model year, shop around until you find one without the navi. The engine has high noise...sounds like a 1970's diesel. Lexus advises that it is due to their decision to go with a mechanical timing chain. I would rather have a quiet vehicle and pay the cost to replace. High wind noise at highway speeds. Buy an Acura, you will be much happier.",2
163,"I bought my 2007 Yaris Hatchback in the end of May 2006. Thus far, I love it. Easy to drive, and much more room than you would think by looking at it. If you are comparing this vehicles to others, don't just look at reviews, go out and test drive this car. The mileage is great and I always have people rolling down their windows and asking how many miles I get to the gallon. Overall, I would give this car a 10 out of 10.",4
164,"I think this is a great car. I got a Thule fit kit right after I got it so I can haul bikes. Can carry 3 bikes on top and 4 people inside comfortably. Has enough power in mountains even with 3 bikes on top, but just barely. Few issues I have are with the low carrying capacity. Also, no interior lock switch reachable from hatch. Illuminated interior makes it difficult to realize you don't have lights on at night. Magic seats are amazingly useful. I actually do use all the modes quite frequently.",3
165,Best car ever for those who need something to drive back and forth to work with. Not good for family use.,3
166,"I am very pleased with this purchase. Not too flashy, not too boring. Fun to drive. It comes at a bargain price with lots of features that would normally cost extra. It handles great, and feels safe and solid. I went into the whole car shopping process fully expecting to buy another Honda Civic, and this car is much better. My first VW, but probably not my last. No regrets here.",3
167,"We bought our Edge as a true crossover, replacing a '01 Mustang GT and a '00 Xterra. The Edge has lived up to almost all of our expectations (Roominess of Xterra, comfort & power of the 'Stang). Great fuel mileage given the size and power of the car. The seats are wonderfully comfortable and supportive. I would challenge anyone to find another car/crossover/mid-size SUV with better second-row legroom. Value received for priced paid is incredible (again, compare to other crossovers/mid-size SUVs).",3
168,Just purchase our Jeep G. Cherokee after driving a J. Cherokee Classic 2000 for about 7 years. Very nice upgrade and lot of interior room compare to our old Jeep. We are very happy and so far so good in gas mileage.,4
169,"I am sad to say that I just had an accident in my March 2008 Cobalt. My Cobalt and a Mini Van collided at very low speeds and my car had $7,700 worth of damage. I could not believe how bad the damage was for low speeds of under 25mph. Air bags did not deploy. It was at a residential intersection. I have another 4 years to pay on this having taken out a 5 year loan. I am very upset about it all. I will not buy another Cobalt if they should be available.",0
170,"This is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned over my 50 years+ of driving easy to drive very good petro mileage considering the size of the vehicle the boot holds a great deal of luggage for holiday trips. The instrument panel is very well laid out. The bonnet has easy access. The vehicle performed extremely well over our 4,600 mile trip. I highly recommend this xl7 any gripes? yes; backing up the vehicle takes some getting used to. Really could use back-up sensors!",4
171,"Loving this Jeep. Hard to find the negatives about it. For those who want more power and complain that it's whimpy, go buy something bigger. It's that simple. But if you are looking for a smaller cheaper SUV and want to park in more places than bigger SUVs, then get this Jeep! I recommend this to anyone. Well, the limited version anyway.",4
172,"I am a car hauler. my max weight is 20,000 lb. I have 19,000 (5 months ) miles on the truck with 3 week in the shop for repairs on the cooling system. It has been hard to do business with kind of preformance.",1
173,"I have owned 2 Fords, 4 Chevys and a Toyota and this is the best truck I have owned to date. It is stupid fast and shifts smooth as butter. Mileage is about 15 in the city. My only compaint would be it is a little hard to get into and rides a little on the stiff side for a 1/2 ton. Brakes, comfort, tranny, motor and initial quality is near perfect!",4
174,"I bought this car brand new on 5/23/07. After 2 months, I called the dealership & said I was unhappy with the mpg. I paid extra for CVT transmission to get 33/36 mpg. On any given day (even while using synthetic oil), my best is 30 mpg. He said no one twisted my arm to buy the car. (no Wonder Nissan yanked their contract from this dealership.) upholstery is rubbed where the child seat sometimes sits. Carpet where the clutch would be if it was manual, looks like I took a razor to it. Molding on the rear right window is coming off. A/c stopped working just past warranty. They won't help to fix a/c system on 2-year-old car. Too bad-was going to upgrade to murano in 2 yrs. When daycare expenses decrease.",0
175,"We have 320 miles on our Rogue, much of that was on the freeway driving home from the dealer (100 miles) and a long back-roads trip the next day. The car is flawless! 27 mpg so far and despite the complaints about what people call the 'rubber band' tranny (CVT), the car just seems to zoom when you step on the gas. I drove home from work today in a driving rainstorm with 30 mph cross winds and it hugged the road like it was on rails. And unlike our Jeep Cherokee, no body lean whatsoever. This is my second Nissan and 5th Datsun family product and they are far the best. We love this car!",4
176,"I've only been driving the Yukon Hybrid for about two weeks now, and I must say bravo for GM. It's so quiet, you barely hear it coming. The hybrid drive shift's so smooth you cant feel it shift.",4
177,"This car drives and handles well. It's fun to drive and is nicely appointed, but it's the most expensive Jetta package, costs over $25,000. Trading in a '01 V6 fully loaded Passat, I didn't want to give up any extras. The new styling is great, and the upgraded 17"" wheels make the car stand out. I did not test drive the car on the interstate before buying...big mistake. The road noise is very noticable, much louder than what I'm used to. I keep turning up the radio to compensate. If I had it to do over, I probably would have looked more at a midsize car and checked for a quieter ride. If you're looking for a small car and can get past the road noise, it's a nice car.",2
178,"I have had the Freestyle only a couple of weeks but I can already see that I made the right choice. It drives good in torrential downpours, it handles well on very curvy roads, it hauls 6 family members ages 5-81 nicely and goes onward through the fog without any trouble. The fuel economy hasn't dropped below 20 mpg in city/highway driving which is a plus considering it hasn't hit 1000 miles yet. This crossover should have stayed on the market longer. I really think Ford made a bad decision by dropping it after just 3 years.",4
179,"Great 2 door car for the money. Nice set of features that come standard and vast array of options and TRD performance upgrades. Making this a performance car might not be worth the money, but a few performance tweaks could make an everyday driver happy. I agree with many others that a rear wiper would definitely come in handy. A major problem in customization for tires. 2008 tC comes with Z rated tires! Sounds great if you are taking this thing to the track, but for everyday driving they are completely unnecessary & expensive. There is no downgrade option for all weather tires - big mistake for car buyers who know what they want.",3
180,Have had the CRV for a few weeks and like the vehicle with some minor tweaks. Went against my better judgment when buying a new car the first year it has major changes but love it none the less. We have a pilot so this was a great addition.,4
181,"Had decided on either a Ford Freestyle or a Toyota RAV-4, but drove a Torrent and liked it much more than the Equinox I had driven earlier. The price versus options was better than the other two vehicles I tried. The ride is comfortable and visibility is good. I also like the fact that the vehicle has stabilitrak and traction control. Mileage is about 22 mpg overall.",4
182,"I originally had a 2006 Spectra which was totaled in an accident when someone lost control of their SUV after they were hit by someone who ran a stop sign. Fortunately the airbag worked well. I was very happy with my 2006 Spectra but before I purchased another one, I wanted to see what other options I had. I drove every make and model out there and could find nothing else that I was more comfortable in or satisfied with than the Spectra, so I promptly purchased another one and have not had, even for a second, any regrets. I even turned down a purchase of a 2005 Jaguar that was selling for the same price as the Spectra. I found reviews of the Spectra to be more reliable than the Jag.",4
183,"I previously owned a Mitsubishi Montero Sport which I drove for 10+ years. Hated to get rid of it so I thought another Mitsubishi would be a good purchase. Gas mileage has been 18 mpg consistently, less than what I got in my MS (which was 19-20 mpg). It it a bigger SUV. Seats are comfortable and great room inside. I have used the back for moving large items and have taken several trips with dog crates so if you need cargo storage, this vehicle can handle the load. Because I loved my Montero Sport so much, I do compare the two vehicles.",3
184,"I purchased the vehicle in January of 2007 based on its styling and fuel economy. I could not believe the features offered in the XR at the price offered. It's a Lexus or a Beemer, even looks like one but for much less. Also, the smoothness of the ride and the quietness as the car rolls along is unbelievable. GM, if you could make the XR a full hybrid, bye-bye Toyota.",4
185,"I drove about 7 vehicles from my list (I did some homework before shopping) and kept coming back to the Tucson. It had everything I wanted. It was small, stylish and plenty of get up and go. I drove the 4cyl and 6cyl versions. I lucked into a sweetheart of a deal on a 2007 Limited. It has all the bells and whistles I could ever want. If you're considering an SUV, do not write the Tucson off just because it's a ""Hyundai."" It's the smoothest riding, zippy, most fun to drive car I've ever had. My only bad thing to say is if you're concerned about today's gas prices, this is not your car. I average 18.6--which is good compared to sticker--but at $4 gallon...",3
186,"I've had the car for 6 weeks and love it! I'm getting 47 mpg in mixed driving, over twice what I was getting in old car. Great hatch, with no liftover - it's easy to get things in and out. Backup camera is a must, difficult to see anything out of rear window. Would not get tan cloth interior again, shows dirt too easy. Would get leather interior, wish they would offer heated seats.",3
187,"Very impressed with this vehicle. Sold my 175K mile Sierra and due to its excellent performance, I'm sold on GMC. The Denali drives and handles great. 18mpg hwy and 16.4 in town. Not bad for a 6.2 ltr V8. My previous 4.8 ltr V8 only beat that by 1mpg! My vehicle came loaded w/options and couldn't pass it up for $38.5K. With gas prices I think they are really having to come down on these things. Very quiet ride on the highway and around town. It does need more storage compartments/center console organizer. I would rather the center console open from the side rather than front. It's somewhat awkward and has a rather flimsy spring hinge.",3
188,"I bought Prius in May 2007. In one year I have driven about 17,000 miles and thought I should write something to benefit other potential buyers. I am extremely happy with ride, comfort, performance etc, but most of all with fuel efficiency. I have been consistently getting 52-53 mpg for last one year, with air on 7 months out of 12 months. The best mileage I have received so far is 62 MPG, while the worst was 47 MPG (when I drove 90 miles/hour long distance, full load and AC on.) Settled on Prius for it's high power engine and electric motor, uniqueness and last but not the least, a Prius is Prius!",4
189,"I bought my V new in 07'. It's been a good car with it's versatility, roominess and comfortable on trips and great road manners. But it has had some problems; engine replaced, drive pulley replaced, constant high pitched squeal with AC on at low fan speed (found TSB for- let's see if dealer will honor), and several squeaks and rattles. I've owned other Honda's, including a V, which is still in the family w/ 189K miles, but I don't think this one will last as long. I'm def. looking to trade it in already. I'm not saying people shouldn't buy the CR-V, but I would advise not to expect the same longevity as previous Honda models.",2
190,"My first Audi and so far is excellent. Loaded A5 (all options except S-line package), ride is fantastic...great in corners, straight, smooth and very quiet on highways. Acceleration is very good and feels quick (better then my '05 Acura TL), especially in sport mode. Audi delivers amazing interiors with high quality. Backseat is okay for small kids, but almost unusable for adults. I'm a tall/big guy who fits very comfortably up front. Technology is great - imports entire Blackberry phone book in one shot with excellent Bluetooth connection. MMI is not difficult to learn, but can be cumbersome. Voice activation not live on the A5. Overall, great blend of luxury and sporty ride.",3
191,"This is one incredible vehicle. Perfect for my needs and one monster beast in the snow and ice. Great interior room, looks great from outside and I can easily haul just about anything. Love the fact no carpet to contend with, sweep and wipe and it's clean. Outstanding reliability. I have over 35,000 miles and have had no issues whatsoever. But then it is a Honda, I expected nothing less.",4
192,"Worst mistake I ever made in purchasing a car. It's a really nice car to look at but, that's it. The all plastic interior just reaks of cheap. The front windshield has you leaning up into the steering wheel to see when the red light changes. No console and thus no decent storage space. The little thing they put on the dash is very lacking. The seats are uncomfortable. The space between you and the passenger is almost non existant. Really cramped feeling. No console between seats and the cup holders are the worst I have ever seen in any vehicle. The arm rest sit too low to be of any use. Window control location is very poor. Rear seat room is very poor.",0
193,"This AWD model has the great handling I love in our Subaru. The engine is responsive enough for everyday driving. Some people complain it's underpowered but for the price and package it's a great value. If you want Mustang or Corvette speeds, go get one of them. This car handles a turn like a wide receiver - sure-footed and quick. Some people complain about road noise but I haven't found it objectionable. My son said the engine, when revved hard, sounds ""like Lightning McQueen"" (from the movie Cars). That's fine with me. The other feature I enjoy is spacious front and rear seating. I'm 6'4"" and there's still room for a real person to sit behind me with no discomfort.",3
194,"This is actually my wife's car, but I'll tell you we test drove everything. If you want to fit in and not have your car have a personality go buy the Lexus or Acura. This car offers more room than anything in it's class. The others we tested were fine, but the CTS has it's own personality and was the best overall ride and drive for us. We tested the 328, G35, IS 350, TL, S40, C- and E-Class. Check this car out for it's overall drive. It is a great choice.",4
195,I love this SUV. Had a 2004 Denali and for the price its as good or better. Same features and at $15000 lower price. Can't be telling this but Hemi is the kicker.,4
196,"I purchased this after looking at the competition. Nothing else in this price range (21,000) can come close. Sorry, but it just would not happen. I was very leery about purchasing a KIA and if not for the warranty I would not have considered this car. I actually have to say, that so far it has been just perfect. I have 5,000 miles now, and everything seems to be in place. The only possible complaint is that the dealer did not properly remove all the protective plastic properly. MPG seems to be a little better now that the engine has broken in. I think I am managing about 20 - 21 mpg on average now. I am still impressed with the performance and power of this vehicle and I am very happy so far",4
197,"You can read all the other reviews for how drivers like this car. They are correct, its sporty, fun, quick, and comfortable. Mass production is not art very often but the styling of this vehicle is beautiful. It is a total expression of minimalism. Everything is understated. The lines are beautiful from any angle. The interior is incredibly simple, yet amazingly feature rich. The controls are very simple to operate, basically allowing for full operation using two dials and two levers. The grace and nimbleness this car exudes while exhibiting its prowess are unbelievably sexy. If you are in the hatchback market, save yourself time and purchase this vehicle.",4
198,This Car is a lot of fun! Ride is great. Sightlines are poor due to sporty design but large sideview mirrors make up for it. Have not had one problem with car. Headroom is a little short due to sunroof.,3
199,"Took on a trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and couldn't ask for a better ride. About a 1200 mile round trip, getting almost 29 miles per gallon. Had no trouble passing or getting up the grades on cruise control. I would definitely buy another Ford product.",4
200,"Loved the car for the frist 15K then the problems started happening. struts, valve bodie, alignment (still not fixed and dealership won't do anything about it) wishield waher fluid tank leaking had to be replaced, horn malfunction, rear window came of of track. these are too many problems for someone who takes good care of their car. aslo it BURNS oil! after 5k of the recommended 10k oil change intervals i'm over 2qts low, VW says thats normal? I have just under 25k on the car and have decided to say goodbye. I could not have imagined this, the car was PERFECT for the first 15K... if buying used watch out for the alignment problem, very comom i'm told.",1
201,"Nice looking truck but way too many serious issues in two years. SW issue that causes battery to drain, when the battery drains with this particular issue then call a flat-bed. Front right axle seal leak (can't be truly fixed as this is a design issue...just keep replacing the same gasket every time it starts leaking!) 4-wheel driver failure. Front transfer case bearing failure...special order for parts required. Rear plastic bumper loses 'shape' on the bottom within one year...looks very cheap. Very frustrating.",1
202,"I was fortunate to be able to get the third Lax Super made at GM's highly acclaimed Oshawa assembly plant. So far, no problems to report. The car's acceleration, exhaust note, and seating comfort are great. It came fully loaded, except for the sunroof.",3
203,"New BMW owner, previously owned Japanese models (Acura, Toyota, Mazda). Very pleased, wonderful car to drive. Scary fast, with great pick up in any gear. The finish and technology are exceptional. I'm very pleased with the choice. Test drove Infiniti G37, but didn't make it out of the BMW dealer after test driving the 335xi (got it on the spot). Didn't go for the nav, bought a Garmin nuvi (noticed BMW also sells Garmins with the BMW branding).",4
204,"Just bought my Chevy Malibu LTZ. Had a Cadillac CTS-V, but due to the cost of gas, had to sacrifice it. This car is awesome. It is extremely quiet, those acoustic windows actually do help a lot. A better value and performer than all the expensive competitors. Chevrolet made another quality product, which is I keep coming back.",4
205,"I absolutely love this pickup. I had just purchased an 07 chevrolet silverado about 4 months ago, just got this, and am now wondering why I ever bought the Chevy. It has much better acceleration, more stylish, more towing, more payload, and overall better build quality also. I never much cared for the Tundras til this year, when they gave it a face lift. It's now bigger and beefier than ever. I'm a big guy, 6'4"" 265 lbs, and I fit in it a whole lot better than I did the Chevy. It has a lot more interior space, and I love the floor shifter.",4
206,"We purchased this car about two weeks ago and already have 1750 miles on it. It is a real nice car to drive and comfortable ride. It also has a lot of power, lot more then the 500 that I drove. I live in Middle Tn. in a rural area which is all hills and curves and we are able to get 22.5 to 23.4 mpg. We went to Kentucky and set the cruise at 65 and got 32.8 to 33.1 mpg.",3
207,"This is my second SLK and I like this model much better. The styling and handling are far superior. I enjoy the improved ride, satellite radio and other new features. I am debating if in my next purchase if I want to to move up to the top of the line in two seaters It is so much money in comparison to the alterantives. I cannot justify a company lease either this would have to b a cash purchase/lease. I'm not sure if the next model is worth it. But I love my SLK.",4
208,"I drive this car 80mi a day in commuting to work on a mix of highway and back roads. It is the perfect balance between comfort and performance. It is a total joy to drive. I live in New England so threw on a set of snows, and even though it is rear wheel drive, with the traction control it handles quite well in the snow. I have put 10,000 mi. on it in 7 months and it has been flawless and I am a detail fanatic. People are always complimenting me on the looks. Just for the fun of it I may consider moving up to the 350 or AMG when I come off this lease.",4
209,"Did a lot of research on convertibles before I bought this one. In general, I think it is a very functional and stylish car. Good driving position and room for the kids. I have had to take it to the dealer 4 times to get rid of the intermittent annoying rattle in the center front of roof and between the front and back right windows. Seems to be a very difficult thing to diagnose and fix.. Hopefully we are getting to the end of the issue. Once resolved, I will love the car.",3
210,"I bought this little gem after having driven a '99 Windstar for almost 10 years. It took a little getting used to the change in size, but overall, this has been a great choice in vehicle! I mostly drive in town, but occasionally get on the highway. I find I get decent mileage in town and excellent mileage on the open road. The car defies the laws of physics. It is very comfortable for even large people and can hold a LOT more cargo than it looks. I love how I can whip in and out of parking spots easily, or slip into the next lane of traffic without cutting off the guy behind me. Overall, it's been a great car to drive and the money I save on gasoline is a dream!",4
211,"It is large and comfortable enough for my wife, three kids and I, and I am 6'4"" 280lbs. My Suzuki DR 400 fits in the bed fine with the tailgate down. It has a smooth ride and handles the Texas Panhandle roads well. We have not owned it long enough to get a real test on mileage but I like what I have seen so far.",3
212,"I have now had 5 Ford F-250 or Ford F- 350 diesel trucks. I tow trailers and use my trucks for work everyday. I have loved all of my Ford trucks until this 2008. This truck is junk. The 2005 Ford F-350 was one of the best trucks I have ever owned. It had tremendous power and fuel mileage pulling my 48' trailer the way I drive at around 11 mpg. The 2008 model gets 5.9 mpg. I have had 2 radiators replaced. The exhaust system has had numerous repairs with most dealers not knowing what to do. It repeating will go into exhaust clean at idle with my foot on the brake and will lurch forward. Ford continues to tell me it will not do this. I have discussed this problem with Ford, I am tired of Ford.",0
213,"After seven BMWs and several other German cars we got smart. No more arrogant service department and $1500 bills to fix something. We upgraded to the Avalon. A summer vacation trip with four adults and lots of luggage saw mileage range from 29 to a high 36 MPG on regular. The rear reclining seats are worth the price of admission. The 'Bluetooth' is simple to set up and use. Best of all is the interior room and comfortable ride. We are a very tall family (I'm 6' 2"" and the shortest one). After @18000 miles we have had NOTHING that needed fixing or adjusting",4
214,"The 08 xB looks less like a box, has more features, more power, is fun to drive, and gets fewer MPG than the prior xB models. I really enjoy the new auto trans with the trick shifting lever it is kinda like a stick without a clutch. The ride is much quieter and so much smoother - even with all the improvements I will always love the looks of the first generation xB over the new one.",4
215,Not my first Civic and won't be my last. I have had this Civic for about two months and I am very happy. Getting over 30 MPG.,3
216,"I have owned my X3 now for several months. The performance is truly unbelievable!I traded in my 2000 ML320 only because the upkeep was becoming more than I was willing to pay. I am so glad I did, this is a much nicer vehicle at a better price. Almost ten thousand dollars less.",4
217,"So my last car was a Honda Accord. I know its not fair to judge this car based on my past vehicle but Im pretty sure that is why I'm not wholly astounded. I find this car to be quite bumpy on the road (as expected from such a small lightweight car), & I truly hate the brakes. I feel like the car is almost out of control when braking. When driving on a bumpy road I feel like I'm riding a bike on a cobblestone road. Maybe I'm not used to it but I've been driving it for 2 weeks already. Car sounds like a tank when accelerating, and really can't keep up with other cars. Overall, I expected better but its still not a bad car. And for the price & toyota name I really can't complain.",2
218,"I purchased my Passat in November 2006. I absolutely love it, but it has had multiple cosmetic problems. My biggest problem is that the leather seats have discolored, and I am getting no help from VW on resolving this issue. I've also had trouble with the Bluetooth (installed by the dealer after-market), and the Nav system had to be replaced after it got ""stuck."" Except for the purchase experience, I have had nothing but customer service trouble with two local dealerships (not the one I purchased it from) and VW Corporate. I love the car, but as soon as I am not upside-down in the note, I will sell it and get a Lexus, just because of the customer service.",3
219,"This is my first new car ever, my previous car was a Nissan Maxima handed down from my mother. I really wanted something reliable and fuss free and I think I got exactly that with the Corrolla. The drive is pretty smooth and easy although pick-up on the highway is above average not as powerful as perhaps other cars in the same class. The interior is nice and plush and I like the extra detailing of the wood accents that come with the LE model. There are some minus points however, the buttons for the audio system are set too far away from the driver, especially if you have shorter arms, no controls on the steering wheel like Honda Civic.",3
220,"A terrific little SUV. Make sure you give it a look when considering small SUVs, I think you'll be surprised! I swore I'd never drive another truck, but this one changed my mind. The comfort may be better for other folks, I have MS, and nothing's really that comfortable to me.",4
221,"Cannot believe the power. Is a real speedster, and surprises many beemers and mbz racers. Have only put 2000 miles on it so far, but some was trip to SF from the OC and got 26+ mpg at ""somewhat"" over the posted speed limit on the 5. Also, coming down Hiway 1 on return trip this thing drives like it is on rails. My wife is equally impressed, although she maintains that on the first ticket she will take away the keys. Love the shift pattern and feel of the clutch/shift engagment. Still takes some getting used to the start up from signals, but it is so much fun to drive like others I look for errands.",4
222,"I just bought a brand new silver 2008 Mazda3. I got the i Touring Value package with the 2.0 liter engine. This is an awesome car. The ride is smooth, and it's really fun to drive! It gets average fuel economy for its class, but the power from the 2.0 liter 4 cylinder engine is much better than you would expect! This car can definitely take off, and the manumatic shifting on the 4 speed automatic transmission is a nice touch. Kudos to the people responsible for this design! It just goes to show you that you don't have to sacrifice style for your money! This car is beautiful! From the halogen headlights, to the black-out tail lights, and the optional 17-inch alloys - this is a sporty car!",4
223,"I have had the car about 2 1/2 months. We went to Fla. on Vacation. I got 21 mpg at 80+ mph. But coming back I drove slower and tried to see just how much mileage it could get. I got 26.2 mpg from Dothan, Ala to Columbus, Ga. The Car has a great ride. The sound system and the Sirius Sat radio and TV are wonderful. My granddaughter always wants to ride with us. Thanks Chrysler. The only thing I see that might be improved quality wise is the shifter. To me it seems not the quality the rest of the van is",3
224,"Owned 2000, 2003 now 2008 XLS. Only concern going in was the transmission. Since the 6speed replaced the 2007 5 speed I decided to go for it. So far the 2008 excels over the 2003 in almost every respect (trunk has slightly less usable space).",3
225,"Ever since giving up on the Chrysler because of its poor performance and gas guzzling tendencies, this vehicle provides the ideal alternative. Better cachet and a much more maneuverable package, the Volvo matches or exceeds all the Pacifica benefits, then goes further with laser enhanced cruise control, satellite stereo, built-in child seats, and a really effective bluetooth system. still, I wish it were more economical.",3
226,"My experience with the Acura MDX 2008 has been nice. I came from driving a 2005 Nissan Max and needed something bigger and better with safety for me at the time (10 mth old son). The MDX does get up and go, but not initially. I have had it less than a year with just 11,000 hwy miles on it and have never had a problem until now. Took a trip to NC and came back with a loud humming noise. Turned out it was bad wheel bearings. Hopefully once fixed, will not happen again. Other than that all has been well and I am happy with the customer service I have received.",2
227,Wanted a new truck but the gas mileage was not as good as the Kia's. Plus I have a lot more room with all the bells and whistles.,3
228,"It has a great feel of the road. Very stable, feels very solid. The road noise is at a minumum. It has plenty of room.",3
229,"Top up or down this car is quiet even without the windblocker! The ride is better than the two V6s I have owned in the last 7 years. The center console panel is every 'gadget' persons' best friend!! This is just a WOW car, the lines, the comfort, the style (top up OR down) it is incredible! The back seat is ""cushy"" (as my 7 y/o son puts it) and the trunk space is substantial even with the top down. Try it, you will love it!",4
230,I traded in my 2006 M35 for a 2008 M35s after 34 months because I was very happy with the first M35 and after looking at other cars in its class believe that the current Infiniti pricing and financing deals make the choice for me.,2
231,"Replaced 1999 Taurus with NAH as primarily a commuter car. 22 miles each way 50-50 split highway/city. During the summer enjoyed 37-39 mpg, but when it got cold - mileage crashed to 30-32 mpg. Have Convenience package - Tech package too much money and what I wanted was the power seat any way. Great seat comfort on long drives; but even though I knew it, the trunk size can be painful. Did not expect car to be conversation piece - many people commenting on a hybrid that is not small or looks like a car. Even Prius owners have admired the car. I love the fact that for a comparable sized car I am using 4 to 6 less gallons a week!",3
232,"Plan and simple, this car is a blast. I find myself looking for reasons to take it for a drive. I like the statement it makes-consume less-have more fun. Roomy, all manner of safety features, smiles from everyone that sees it. What is not to like.",4
233,I have 08 F-350 Super Duty DRW with 6.4 Power Stroke and 4.10 rear end. Drove truck on 2200 mile trip towing a 6500 LB. boat with a 600 LB. quad in the bed. Avg. mpg was 13.2 for the trip. Mixture of mountain towing and flat lands. Truck performed exceptionally well...great power and brakes. Now that I'm back with 5000 miles on truck I have seen 17 mpg empty. Truck is breaking in well and mpg is climbing. This truck is the best tow vehicle I've ever driven. It has the guts to pull hard on 6% grades with no sweat.,4
234,This maybe one of the most fun cars I have ever driven. I have had two Mercedes and they were not as much fun as my Ralliart. It is a very nice car!,4
235,"Ok I love this car! There is no doubt about it! It drives and handles excellently. I have the auto box and it is excellent. All around this is a great car for the money. I see a lot of owners here saying they are not as happy w/ the mpg and while it is a bit lower, I will take the fun to drive factor any day! I get about 30 on hwy and overall I have averaged about 27 total w/ mixed driving. Overall have never been to the dealership except for maintenance. My dealership is pretty friendly I live in Chattanooga where the new VW plant is being built and so the dealership there just got rebuilt and is top notch!",4
236,"This car replaced a 2002 performance package Crown vVc - and is the only car we liked when shopping for a new car. It drives like a much larger car and feels like a rear wheel drive car. We dislike front wheel drive torque steer common in so many of today's cars. The Taurus has none of that and has great road manners. I know it's not the fastest, or the sportiest, but it represents great a great balance of comfort, performance, utility and economy. To me that is the mark of a great car. This is a great car!",4
237,"I had a 2005 500 AWD which was an excellent car. Bought it used , ex rental, I drove it until 2008 and never put a penny into it except normal services. During that time I got 30mpg on the highway at posted speeds. If you put your foot down the mileage dropped like everything else on the road. Best big car I have had. In 2008 I had promised myself a new 500. When Ford changed the name I pretty well gave up until I tried it out. The car is not much different than the 500 except the trans and engine. Otherwise the Taurus is a 500. I have the sel AWD which handles better than anything else I have including a 2007 F150 4X4. This truck I leave parked during the winter and drive the car. Best car yet",4
238,"Love this car, fast learning curve, very easy to park with back up video, plenty of spaces for things, 2 glove compartments, remote compartment, glasses compartment, 4 cup holders, external audio in to radio for cassette tape player or mp3 - love it, love it, love it!",4
239,"I bought the car new in 2007 and have enjoyed it ever since. Good performance, but the handling could be a little tighter. MPG is constantly around the 30 mark. I have 40000 miles on it and it has not given me any trouble. There were a couple of squeaks/rattles at the beginning but they have since vanished. I would recommend this car from my personal experience. Happy Motoring.",4
240,"Got the 2008, with the hemi variable engine displacement engine. Extremely smooth ride, excellent handling on highway and in city driving. Not burdened with a lot of useless luxury items, but is loaded with very functional and fun stuff. Carried 4 adults and 2 kids very comfortably. Gas mileage is what you would expect for a vehicle of this type. Love it and would recommend it highly.",4
241,"The placement of the a/c condenser, close to the ground, and very little protection from the grille can cause foreign objects to damage the condenser, especially small rocks. A very small rock penetrated through the grill and damaged the condenser causing a micro hole depressurizing the a/c system. The a/c no longer works. I took it to a Toyota dealer even though it is under warranty I still had to pay $80.00 for them to look at it because the damage was caused by an outside object and was not covered. The bill to repair it was $1200.00. Toyota should have put wire mesh in that area of the grille to protect the condenser. Positives are gas mileage and price, but you get what you pay for",2
242,"This vehicle was chosen carefully - a decision for Outlook versus M-B GL350, CX-9, Highlander, Pilot. Outlook wins out in space, ""adult"" seat count and access, power/weight ratio, size, driveability, towing and AWD. We also suspected that the fuel economy would be worse than advertised, and it is. We live in the southwest with a lot of flat land and mountain grades as well. I've managed 19 mpg at 75 mph on the freeway. In town, 14-15 mpg. Hey people: when you spend 40 grand on a vehicle you better be able to afford an extra couple hundred bucks a year on gas for driving a 4,700 pound CUV. It's not a giant size Yaris! Our 7,000 lb diesel crewcab 4wdF350 gets 20 mpg but that's another story...",2
243,"I traded my '04 Accord, as I needed more space and maximum mileage. The Fit hasn't disappointed. I average 36- 37 mpg in open and rush-hour driving. I've carried lots of cargo, including a 46"" TV upright right behind the driver's seat. Seating configurations are great. It's easy and fun to drive, maneuver, and park. The only thing I miss from my Accord (which I loved) is the automatic temperature control.",3
244,This car is fun to drive. I feel confident in heavy traffic. So smooth and quiet on acceleration that I find myself flying down the highway. It stops as fast as it accelerates and is very comfortable on long trips.,4
245,"You would be amazed that this vehicle is a truck and not a car, it drives that well. Excellent handling and more than enough power for the road. I haven't owned a Toyota in years but I'm elated to be back. Great design, fabulous handling as well as great fuel mileage make this truck a must have. Don't be misled by believing that a small size truck will give you better fuel mileage and more economy, this Tacoma Pre-Runner will dish out big truck features and save you money at the pump as well!! Remarkable that they can pull it all off with such a nice sized vehicle that doesn't leave you feeling like you stepped out of a shoe box instead of a roomy substantial truck! Fantastic!",4
246,"In its price range, the Si stands out. Stock, it's on par with the GTI, Cobalt, supercharged tC, and RSX Type-S. Yet the GTI and supercharged tC are limited as tuner cars and are more expensive for the setup and don't handle as well. The Si even compensates for low toque with its high rev short throw setup. It's interiors and Honda's build quality beat out the Cobalt and RSX (how it beats the ""higher class"" version of the same company is a mystery to me), and the GTI's exterior is a matter of personal taste. Whether its stock or tuned, the Si packs a punch behind the wheel and outdoes its competitors. It even has bonuses like a 300w audio system, moon roof, and a sleek racy design.",4
247,"This SUV is rock solid yet handles very well for a full size vehicle. The interior is very comfortable and cabin noise is very minimal. If you need seating for 7 this is the flagship vehicle. Vastly superior to the Audi Q7, Burban, mini-vans or anything else for that matter. If you want people mover, the search is over. I came out of a 2006 GM product that thought the service center was it's second home. Mercedes exudes quality and the dealership personnel treat you better. Quality does not cost, quality pays.",4
248,I have had nothing but trouble with the fuel system I contacted Dodge and they know of the problems but refuse to fix them I was told I could watch a dvd if I had any questions the problem arose with the blue tech after I bought the truck (with all blue techs) to fix it you have to dive 45 min for 45 mph w/o going under 45 mph and under 2000 rpm every week this with give you the truck terrible mpg and wear and tear on the truck for no reason I tell everyone I know do not buy Dodge because if something goes wrong it's your fault for buying their product if you don't have the time to waste 1 1/2 hours a weeks for no reason at all buy a Ford or Chevy look into it for yourself call any Dodge dealer,0
249,"The Camry meets all of my expectations. It is a solid, dependable, good looking vehicle that has proven itself to be the best value in its class. I treated myself to the navigation with bluetooth capable telephone functions. Combine that with the adjustible heated leather seats, smartkey entry and starting, and the traction control and you have a damn nice car (lexus like) right at $30,000. But, it does not turn heads (although the the new body style is not as soft as previous years). There are a billion Camrys on the road yet I still feel special in mine. It is a safe choice.",3
250,"I purchased the IS 250 in February with 8 miles on it. I love it so much. The only thing that i would love more about this car, is if the thermostat were hotter and the fan blew as good as the air conditioner. Other than it is wonderful, and i would recommend this car to anyone.",3
251,"I bought the Nitro on a whim, but have had no regrets ever since. I've had no Major problems with the truck. The only issues i've had is i wish chrysler put a manual lumber support in the drivers seat. Now the truck is 2 years old, i to have a rattle on my dash somewhere, minnor issues with the remote and the overdrive is acting up, activates at 45 and bogs the motor down less you speed up to over 50 or drop down yo 40 mph (chrysler knows about it), so dont hesitate to complain to your dealer or even chrysler about the issue, before your warranty runs out. Having said all that, I still luv my truck even after 2 years and I've gotten more compliments out of the nitro then any I've had.......",3
252,"I traded in two vehicles before buying my Speed6, a Dodge Ram 1500 and a Ford Focus ZX4 sedan. This car blows them both out of the water by a mile in terms of quality and character. I cross-shopped a few different cars, mainly the Mazdaspeed 3, Volkswagen GTI Fahrenheit, Volkswagen R32, Subaru Legacy GT. I've driven 1000 miles already in 2 weeks, and I absolutely love this car. I find excuses to run errands, and it makes my daily 90 mile commute something to look forward to. Best vehicle I've ever owned, and this is my 7th car.",4
253,"Traded in a 03 xterra, for the rogue. Thought I could save on gas. xterra was getting 16 - 18 mpg. rogue looked like a good choice, but after three fills mpg was 17 at best with 50/50 city/highway driving. long story short, I love my new 08 xterra and someone else will be getting a good deal on a USED rogue.",4
254,"I drove my Corolla for a year with the impression that it had a big-car feel and a very smooth feel (smoothest ever in fact). Then something broke, and the dealership has been unable to fix it. Now I do not feel safe driving on the interstate because if I hit even a small bump (and especially a series of small bumps) it feels like I am going to loose control. At slower speeds, it is just uncomfortable to drive on anything but the smoothest of roads. The dealership claimed to replace the front struts, and maybe they did because it did seem to reduce the rough feel for a 1-2 days.",1
255,Got this car last month. Its amazing. I like its engine - much better than 1.8L Honda Civic. Definitely would recommend. Totally worth the price.,4
256,"I traded a Focus and Sky and got the best of both worlds- the functionality of the Focus and nearly the power of the Sky Turbo. I call it my ""hybrid"". The fit and finish is a real step up. Of all the small luxury vehicles the C30 is the best choice- more stylish and sportier than the A3 and much more roomy than the Mini. As far as the other small vehicles like the Civic, Corrola, etc. they cannot even start to compare.",4
257,"I bought my Sorento 2 months ago after long research about the vehicle. I gave it a try because the looks of the car and the engine. When I went to the dealer and tested it, I got impressed and bought two of them, the other for my wife. What I like the most is that it has a smooth ride and the engine is very powerful for the Texas highways. It handles well on bumpy roads. My wife almost crashed hers, but the car handled very well and nothing happened. The drawback of the car is the sound system. The front speakers have an average power but the rear ones are very weak. The car has plenty of storage spaces, cup holders and lighting consoles which are nice features.",3
258,"I love this car already. The gas mileage has been excellent so far (38 mpg), and it's a real head turner in traffic. There are a few things that take some getting used to, including the center-mounted display, but after about 2 days I began to wonder why all cars don't have it. For a pretty small car, the Yaris sure does have plenty of leg room. It will whip in and out of traffic in the city, and when you take it out on the interstate, it will absolutely fly down the road with suprising comfort. Overall very fun to drive, good looking, and a smart move considering the price of gas these days.",4
259,I researched sedans on Edmunds 3 years ago and compare all the foreign cars as well as domestic. Hyundai turned out to be the best deal hands down over ALL OTHER car makers. So I decided from that point forth to buy a Hyundai. I got a great deal from my dealership (below invoice per Edmunds). I have 27000 miles on this car. I haven't had any real problems with it (except for the recall). I have since upgraded this car with the factory keyless start system (its awesome). Great fuel economy. I started off getting 27-31mpg. Now I'm getting 35mpg. I've driven this car in treacherous snow conditions and she handled like a breeze. I'll probably update again at 50k miles.,4
260,"I bought this car new w/the Grand Touring package and optional nav system. Wow! Mine is black mica. Body is aggressive yet tasteful, and the 18"" wheels and larger spoiler distinguish this car. The controls are intuitive and there are many luxury features (i.e. auto a/c, 6 CD changer, Bose stereo, steering wheel controls, auxiliary input jack). The seats feel awesome and hug your body. The performance speaks for itself. Great handling, ridiculous amounts of torque, all around solid feel on the road. My only complaint is low gas mileage 16 city, 25 hwy. However, bottom line, I love the car.",3
261,"Overall, I am very happy with my G35. It is one of the most beautifully styled cars on the road, and it is really fun to drive. As a driver who spends almost all of his time in stop-and-go driving, the gas mileage is a little subpar (17-18 mpg in the city, but much better on the highway). I expected this, however, when purchasing this car. Overall, I am thrilled with my car and would recommend it to anyone who wants a laundry list of features in a reasonably-priced, luxury car.",4
262,The looks are better than almost any car on the road. The price compared to the competition makes this car a real bargain.,4
263,"OK I have now had 6 months behind the wheel - yes my math is good - sat out the three winter months from 12-20 to 3-20. But WOW what a fun car. No regrets no looking back. Looked at others and this is it. Keep in mind second car - I have a small SUV for hauling business associates, family and cargo. But for fun there is no other. Will hold two sets of golf clubs with small carry bags and with removal of woods and careful placement in trunk - maybe add a small garment bag - that is it. The top design is the best - watch to see what cars are driving on a nice day with top up - not as many Miatas - it is too easy to drop the top. Lower windows and release the clasp - throw the top and go.",4
264,"This is a great car. However, there are three areas worth consideration: 1) it is very difficult to pull out of the front seats while exiting the vehicle, (2) the front doors swing out so wide it is extremely difficult to reach the handle and close the door, 3) while backing out there is a major problem seeing what is behind you when you look over your right shoulder (blind spot between right rear window and back window).",3
265,"I cannot believe how excited I am every time I drive my new Elantra. All of my friends absolutely love this car (as do I). I spent 4 months researching and test driving new cars, and for only 17 grand, I have never, and I mean NEVER encountered a car that looks as classy and has so much value. I have the optima white with beige interior and I have to say I like the design of the dash in the Elantra even more than the one in my partner's Audi A3 (though I have not a single complaint about the A3). Overall, a wonderful vehicle. Fun to drive, classy, and a great bang for the buck!",4
266,"Just bought my second CX-7. After 2 years, turned in a leased Galaxy Gray GT for a purchased 2008 Mica Copper Red GT, Sand leather interior loaded with every option. It is the first time ever I have repeated on a new vehicle with the same body style. The CX-7 was ahead of the styling curve and the other 'crossovers' are just catching up. Exception is the Infiniti FX, a great vehicle, but for price and value, the CX-7 cannot be touched. Some ding it for the mileage, but its reasonable for its class and the 2008-09 can use regular fuel (07 required premium). Performance (244 hp) and handling are like a sports car. Zoom Zoom is more than hype. My other car is a 350z roadster. Both are a blast.",4
267,"Fun car to drive. Best pickup I've had on a ""normal"" vehicle of any kind. GREAT on gas mileage and reliability. Only problem I have with this car is the driver seat is very uncomfortable. I am of average height and weight but the seat is terrible. Great interior design and roomy for a fairly small car. Would buy again except for the seats. If they don't improve on them, I would buy something else.",3
268,"I traded in a '01 Audi A4 for my '07 5-door Rabbit. I loved my A4, but I love the Rabbit more. The only feature missing from my Audi is the Homelink and auto-dim mirrors. Everything else is just as good or better. This was definitely not a step down. Everything about this car is just right and the value is unbeatable. It's quick, fast, and super comfortable. You're not likely to come across many others out on the roads, so it's cool to be driving a unique car. I agree with the poster that said if they made this any nicer, it would be an Audi. I thought I might regret not getting the GTI, but I definitely do not. While I love the 2.0T, this 2.5 is a fantastic engine.",4
269,"I have this car for two weeks now and I am very satisfied with it. I hate when some people write a review on a car without ever owning it. That's just plain hot air. If you are looking for Detroit quality, this is the one. Mine is loaded with all available options including DVD navigation. Two major options are the 17"" wheel sport package, which by the way is the only wheel package that you can get with the navigation system and the 3.6 luxury package. I was luck enough to find the car in stock at a dealer in New Jersey. Apparently, not too many are ordered like this one in white diamond with all the bells and whistles. I literally bought this car over the phone. Not to bad for Detroit Iron.",4
270,This car is amazing! Couldn't be happier. The power this thing puts out is unbelievable. The only bad thing about this car is the gas mileage. But I guess thats just a minor downside to any car with this much power. Definitely worth it though. The 6th gear helps a lot with highway driving. This car can run circles around an Rx8. Any Mazda person can tell you that.,3
271,"Absolutely the most fun vehicle I have ever experienced. From ride handling, power, advanced technology, interior design; Lexus has created a machine where ideals and perfection live in harmony and everything is for the best. Yes! It's is utopia!",4
272,"I love this vehicle! Was a bit hesitant as I moved from a Mercedes E500 and thought I'd miss the HP & luxury but the Volvo has far exceeded expectations. I drive through Colorado about 50K/year and with Blizzak tires, the Volvo is extremely dependable & secure. I will drive 600 miles in one day and finish refreshed & happy. Averaging 24 MPG on non-premium gas. Certainly not a race car - but you should know that going in. Two thumbs up. Only complaint, the key stinks.",3
273,"We are a mid 30's couple with 3 kids who typically buys imports. I recently purchased a 2007 Acura MDX Sport to replace a Lexus -- so I have a good reference point. We traded in a Toyota Sienna. Never thought we'd buy a Buick, but were always open to an American car that is competitive on the merits. This car makes a mockery of most competitors. This is a remarkable car that feels like it should cost $15k more (at least). Build quality and quietness are superior to my Acura, and it is far more plush and stylish in my opinion. It appears to be nothing short of the rebirth of the American family vehicle. Put your image of Buick as you know it aside and give this thing a try.",4
274,"This is my 3rd Camry since 1993. Stuck with the Camry since I've always had good luck. Heard the 2007 had problems with acceleration, but figured they had fixed that on the 2008. Having same problem with 2008 as people did with 2007. Problem is still not fixed and I want to slap myself for not test driving my new car. Once you get on the highway, it rides beautiful, but my ride to work is all stop and go.",2
275,"I have had my Q7 for about a month now and I love driving this SUV. I got the showroom model so it comes with 20"" wheels and alloy rims. The A/C controls are a bit difficult to figure out at first, but once you get the hang of it you will find its usefulness. We have rear climate control, the Bose sound system, power tailgate, Bluetooth, 3rd row seating, and of course the MMI (navi) among few of the features.",3
276,"Wanna be really popular - get one! It's an automatic smile generator plus easy to park, good gas mileage for city use. It isn't a BMW so don't expect that type of performance. Quick starts and at one week ownership - gas mileage looking great. Beats the gas hog MBenz that I was driving and required $65 to fill up after giving me 20 miles per gal.",4
277,"I bought this over the competion for a 4 door AWD sedan. I will have to get winter run-flat booties, but that is a minor inconvenience. My daughter runs iDrive like a pro, without reading the manual. It is not nearly as bad as most of the auto rags make it out to be. the cup holders are kinda wonky, but there really is nowhere else to put em. Keyless entry is the way to go. I have the sports package and the seats are great. The engine is a piece of art. The gas mileage is about the same as was my former AWD Volvo, and more that 80hp more power. Fit and finish is top shelf. The stereo is great, and quite flat in audio response. Car is very quiet, except when you boot it, and hear that engine!",3
278,"The new civic is a substantial improvement over the last design. I traded in my 99 SI civic for this one and I like the new car. I once owned a 1980 Civic that was fun to drive and rode 50 miles to the gallon. This car is way bigger than that was, but also feels much more luxurious than the 99. Yeah, it's not a $50,000 BMW, but I wanted a car that gets at least 35 MPG highway, so compare it to that field. The civic is much more interesting than a Corolla. The Mazda 3 is a worthy alternative, and you won't see quite so many either, but the new honda is very smooth. Honda has always been known for making quality engines, and this one very refined. Great fit and finish, don't buy any extra",4
279,"Have had car for one year, mpg when new was 28 now a year later is 37 mpg long highway trip to work, car is no frills boring to drive, runs great no issues plan to buy it when lease is up, only complaint is rear defogger not up to par, also had someone hit my bumper at 3 mph bill was 1800.00 to fix that is not right for such a small hit.",3
280,"Excellent vehicle for the price! Great commuter car! MPG is in the mid 30s in Dallas traffic. The center instrument cluster is easy to get used to, and easy to read. The steering handles very well, and the car reacts quickly when needed, but initially takes getting used to. Braking is good, but clutch can be a little stiff in stop-go traffic. It rides very well, if somewhat noisy. Lots of room for such a small car, including great head clearance both front and back, and good trunk space. Sits high, which makes entry and exit easy, and gives the feel of a larger car. This car was an excellent buy; thank you Toyota!",4
281,"Overall, a good value for the money compared with other SUVs in this class.However...at 4000 km there was an oil leak which took 3 trips to the dealership and was finally fixes with silocone sealant.During the winter,the windshield washer fluid reservoir broke and had to be replaced.Windshield is surprisingly fragile - accidentally dropped the wiper arm when replacing the wipers and the windshield cracked all the way to the top.I also have a 2005 Chevy Malibu and the Santa Fe is missing a lot of the nice add-ons.It even doesn't have auto on headlights (come on, I get leather seats and not this!).I have had less problems with my Chevy (and previous one) in 5 years than with the Santa Fe in 1.",2
282,"First, let's be clear. I'm a satisficer, not a maximizer. All cars are compromises, and this is expecially true at the lower end of the price spectrum. I'm 6'2"" and, ahem, let's just say over 300 pounds at the present time. I can get in and out of this car with no problem. It runs like a charm, turns on a dime, the steering and braking are silky smooth and I've still got a quarter of a tank left with the odometer at 325+ miles, so I'm heading for 40+ mpg on the first tank. Yes, the seats could be better, maybe Toyota will fix them, maybe not. The cup holders are neat - you can send the air around them - or use the AC to cool your drink. Nothing's perfect, but the Yaris is awfully good.",3
283,"I've owned this car for 6 months and it is great, I am very impressed. I've owned foreign and domestic cars and this is the best by far. I averaged 25.8 MPG mixed city and highway over 7000 miles. The controls are well thought out and the car is very comfortable. Test drive it and you will not be disappointed.",4
284,"My Vue was purchased mid June and since then I've had to take it back to the shop for a couple issues. The Vue sign on front of hood was damaged somehow, looked as if it was bleeding on the inside. The passenger door handle sticks. Although I took it in and everyone at Saturn was very polite they still have yet to fix my door handle properly. It still sticks really badly. The Saturn sign was fixed. Now I have to go back because the wipers have chipped and have small rust spot. Other than that it drives beautifully very hot look and gas mileage is adequate for car of that size.",2
285,"When I first saw the car I fell in love with it. Since then I wish I could divorce it! Horrible rattles, squeaks and poor workmanship. The car has already been in the shop for over 15 days here and there. I know VWs are known for their excellent craftsmanship but this car has loose dash parts, the black paint bubbling and peeling off of the unlock/lock buttons. Maybe mine's a lemon, but I would never recommend VW to anyone! I just hope my bonus is big enough to trade this piece of junk in! Too bad something that looks so good is so bad!",0
286,"This awesome car is the complete package. It handles as well as my Porsche Boxster and has much more power. Yet it seats four, with comfort and with the top up is as quiet as a coupe. Luggage is limited with the top down, but more than enough with the top up. The ride is excellent and I have had no complaints on the run flats. The sport seats are infinitely adjustable and comfortable for long trips. We did not get iDrive and I am glad from what I have seen. The iPod option is great and much better deal than getting the cd changer. Get about 20 mpg around town and high 20's on the road. A little over 1500 miles and no problems. This car does everything well.",4
287,"Just bought one for my daughter. I've been driving it until she comes home for Christmas break. great car, fun to drive. It's a great value and I wouldn't mind having one for myself.",3
288,Love it.. I wish it had heated seats like the Honda Pilot though. It looks good and drives great. A little unstable in high winds. Controls are positioned rather oddly.,3
289,"I traded in my 99 Yukon for one of the remaining 07s since the redesigned 08s hit dealers this month. The vehicle is everything I thought it would be and more. I tested the new CR-V and found some inherent design issues with it. For what the Highlander is, a small-mid size SUV I think it couldn't be better. Power, MPG, interior layout, comfort, handling all are tops. I'm so pleased I was able to get what I wanted with regards to color and options, very few were remained in the Southwest.",4
290,"This new 2007 Rabbit 2dr is the perfect car for city driving. Great quality feel, good handling, good acceleration and excellent braking. I feel like I am driving a $35k luxury car! Very tight body, good vision, and great German engineering (attention to detail). The car seems well planted to the ground. You do sacrifice some fuel economy, but in return, get a very safe and stable vehicle that comes in a small package. I am very impressed with this vehicle and the many features that come standard on this car. I am on my 4th day of ownership. Everything seems to be screwed together well. I cannot comment on the reliability of my new Rabbit.",4
291,"Amazing car for the price. I wouldn't trade it straight up for any non-hybrid in the medium sized sedan class. Great gas mileage on the road, comfortable and has plenty enough power. Looks nice and I have actually had people come up to me to comment on it's beauty. Really!!!",4
292,"I looked at a lot of cars, and decided that the Jetta Wolfsburg Edition was the one for me. It has plenty of punch, a quality interior, and all the right extras. I didn't think I could get something so solid for what I was looking to spend. I love my VW.",4
293,I like that way this car handles and that is what sold me. The repair problems have made me decide to get rid of this car after having had it only 10 months. It seems like it's hard to keep ahead of it falling apart. I have never had the misfortune to have ever gotten a car like this before.,1
294,"This a great economy car. I consistently get around 30 mpg on 50/50 highway city drive. The reliability has been excellent so far. The ride is where this vehicle is lacking a lot. Maybe the goal was to make the car with stiff suspension to look and handle more sporty. The result is rough ride with clearly pronounced and annoying bumps - ""haystack wagon"" as somebody else called it. My other car is Huyndai Elantra and believe me the difference in ride quality is huge.",3
295,"I have owned the EX35 for 18 months. It has 12k miles on it. Have had no significant service issues with the car. I like the overall driving experience of the car. Handles like a sports sedan vs an SUV. Looks are subjective, but it has grown on me. The car has developed annoying interior squeaks and rattles, dealer cannot locate them. The car gets HORRIBLE mileage, like avg of 16.5. I've never cracked 20 mpg in 18 months. With the cost of premium fuel this is a serious deficiency of the car - IMHO. It's NOT due to my driving style. Had I known of this mileage issue I would not have purchased the EX35. Sorry Infiniti - I like it - I don't love it.",2
296,"I love my new Civic because you can chill with it and get great gas mileage or you can give it hell and still get pretty good gas mileage, and it is fun to hit the gas. The interior design is tight esp. With the navi. Overall great car.",4
297,This car is so nice and fun to own that It seems to make non-hybrid cars obsolete. The fuel mileage gauge makes driving a very fun and challenging game. The car is smooth and driver friendly. I love it.,4
298,"We bought a used 07, All options, Hemi, Nav, Remote Start, everything. I bought it in Atlanta, GA I live in Roanoke, VA. Trip home was good. 455 miles and got 21.2 mpg on the Hemi MDS engine. No complaints on gas. A vehicle this size! That?s good. It could have been better I suppose but I was on and off the gas, since I had a new toy! It has a smooth ride, very quiet. The Hemi climbs the mountains effortlessly. I was going 80 mph up the mountains at only 2000 rpm. It gets a lot of looks. The 20? chromes really set it off. The third row seat access is by far the easiest out there. The lever on the second row seat is so simple. Get the Hemi with MDS. No use for the Flex fuel, No 85oc here.",3
299,"Our mileage (5,700 miles) is 38.7 mpg compared to 20 mpg with our BMW which it replaced. Excellent. But no fun to drive; the indifferent imprecise steering feels like a 70ties car, and it accelerates very slowly in the beginning. Once it moves, it is okay.",3
300,"We fell in love with this car since we got one as a loaner when I took my brother's Scion in for service. This car is simply awesome! I'm getting 49 mpg mostly city driving. It's quiet and comfortable and it has lots of gadgets to play with. We went with a package 5 which has everything but leather seats. We'd have gotten the leather if it's heated. It has bluetooth, backup camera, a super clear touchscreen (best i've seen), JBL stereo, HID headlight, smart key, navigation, etc. It's not that expensive either, considering it has so much to offer.",4
301,"After owning a Mazda 3 for 2 years I was looking for a good looking fuel sipper with reliability. After checking VW rabbit, Scion XD, Honda Civic and Lancer, I drove the Accent SE as I always liked the looks and still own a Santa Fe with 70000 miles. It has respectable power and the SE handles very well. The 5 speed B&M shifter is smoother than the Mazda's and is very comfortable and quiet on the road. Interior is spacious and fit and finish is very good. I'm averaging over 30 miles per gallon so far in combined city/highway driving. Don't overlook this car when considering a compact vehicle DRIVE IT . The warranty is unbeatable.",3
302,"We bought our nitro new and has been flawless after 10 months. Have found no flaws in the paint and interior. I use 4x4 for snow. The seats are very comfortable. We average 20mpg overall mileage after 9000 miles. The sunroof chrome clad 17 inch wheels, red paint really gets noticed. It has plenty of power and rides good for a 4x4. It is a solid suv at a good price.",3
303,"My wife chose this over my preference for a CX-7 and no regrets. Well-built, roomy, drives well and nicely designed and finished interior. Wasn't sure about the looks, but they grow on you. V6 option would be nice.",3
304,"Bought my Subaru Legacy in October. Have the 4 door Sedan Special Edition Auto. It is a blast to drive. Passing performance is excellent. MPG is good for AWD car. Get mid 20's in city, 30 or just under on highway. Very quiet inside and visibility out is perfect. New this year for sedan are 60/40 split fold down seats and mp3 aux input. Dash is easy to read, safety scores are tops. Interior is classy and well put together. There is a rattle or two however. Drive this car before buying any other mid-size sedan.",3
305,"I've always had small American cars. I was tired of throwing money away after 60K. Everyone I know that has a Toyota, loves it. I thought it was about time I owned one. I love my mother's Rav4 but it was too pricy for my budget. My Yaris has every single upgrade except a spoiler & is still a better deal than a basic Corolla.",3
306,"I have the new 6.7-Liter Cummins turbo diesel engine equipped with the six speed automatic transmission. I have to say that durability is very important to me. This truck has a ton of power, and has been reliable, even starting at -6 with no problem at all. The transmission shifts gears smoothly, never searching for the right gear as some others do. I would recommend this truck to anyone who is looking for a reliable truck that rides really smooth for a heavy duty ¾ truck.",4
307,"I work out of my automobiles and had driven a Honda CRV for the past 5 years. It was time for a new vehicle and I had decided to buy another Honda. The night before I went to buy it I was on the computer researching cars and read the reports on the FJ Cruiser. I decided to go and give it a test drive that next morning. Thank goodness I did. I knew the minute I drove it this was the SUV for me. I love it! I have only had it for a short time but it feels safe and I love the way it handles. Oh, did I tell you how great I think it looks?",4
308,"We have 12000 miles on our Enclave. Love the car. Traveled from Illinois to Florida and car performed beautifully. Car had a bad battery at delivery but that was quickly resolved. Excellent highway mileage, 22 mpg. with full load. Very comfortable ride and so far all accessories performing perfectly. Some visibility problems for shorter drivers.",3
309,I knew I had to have the XL7 as soon as my husband and I test drove it!! I love the room it has inside. The third row is so convenient. The storage is great and it rides really good. My daughter even loves it! Not too big and not too small. Perfect size for the three of us. Had no trouble out of it so far. I LOVE my XL7!,4
310,"In addition to an excellent safety rating, it had the most features at a reasonable price. Spacious interior, excellent V6 power engine, smooth and quiet drive, easy fold 3rd-row seat. We like the sleek exterior style, as well as the re-modeled interior (2007).",3
311,"This is my first diesel and I am absolutely amazed at the quick response in acceleration. I've only put 1600 miles on it but average 15 mpg around town and just over 17 hwy. The interior is absolutely great. Instruments are easy to read and with the steering wheel controls, don't have to look around to do most of the common things done while driving (cruise control, radio station, volume). The dash information center is great, mileage avgerage, distance to go before refill. The added feature of integrated brake control for trailering is fantastic. The 180 degree rear doors are really great when loading goods or people in the back seat. Diesel is very quiet. You can actually talk while driving.",4
312,"I looked at a lot of cars before choosing the Aura XR. No other car could compare to the XR in this price range. In order to find a comparable car you need to add at least $5,000 to the price tag. This car has awesome performance. Unlike a lot of the competitors products you do not have to be running at redline RPM to feel the power of the car. This car has power to spare at any RPM. The six speed transmission is fantastic and a lot of fun. The transmission is crisp but not jarring. The paddle shifters are a hoot. I have gotten a lot of compliments on the styling of the car. People just can not believe that it is a Saturn. Give the Saturn XR a try. This one is a keeper.",4
313,"Good car excellent drive response, fully loaded, leather, power seats, heated seat and instrumental panel well designed",3
314,"I have 8k miles on my SE and though it took some time to bond with it, I truly enjoy driving it. Once you accept this is a fwd car (and will never handle like a rwd car) it's probably one of the better handling large fwd cars out there, especially under $40k. Suspension is tight in the corners and smooth on the straights. 3.5L engine provides fantastic performance but could easily be higher if Nissan didn't have to worry about competing with their Infiniti line. CVT (continuously variable transmission) is quite remarkable. Feels like it always gears the vehicle down for better performance, especially at higher speeds. 50 to 100 mph feels more like 350hp with the CVT. A special ride indeed.",4
315,"I've had my automatic Fit Sport for about 1 1/2 years and would not recommend it. Gas mileage is only about 28 in city. A/C bogs down engine power and can't cool consistently in heat of AZ summer - goes warm, cold, warm, cold. Inner upholstery is a lint magnet. Biggest peeve - Car is noisy and rattly over-all, with a major rattle inside the dash. Had this from the beginning, service can't seem to fix it. Visibility is poor with huge blind spots on front sides and very hard to see when backing up, especially if you are short like me. Tires go low on air, alignment goes out easily, engine making a high- pitched sound, service says they ""can't hear it."" Same for rubbing sound when turning left.",1
316,"I put in a lot of time and researched all the available makes and models, both hybrid and gas, that would satisfy my current needs. Based on the MPG, reliability, looks and price the RAV4 edged out the Honda CR-V. Now that I have had the car for several weeks I am thrilled that I decided on the RAV4. The V6 is surprisingly powerful and quick for the MPG that you actually get. We are averaging 25.3 MPG so far. The sport model has larger rims and tires with fender well moldings that really make a difference in the overall look of the vehicle. The interior is very well thought out and convenient. As I drive around and look at the other new cars on the road I'm very pleased with my purchase.",3
317,"Had my doubts as to how refined the Forester would be coming from an '02 Infiniti G20. But I was pleasantly surprised by the solidity and finish of this vehicle. The size is just right for our soon-to-be 3-person household and the volume of the trunk cargo area is very useful. The fabric of the seats seems very durable, interior plastics are of reasonably high quality, and the dark gray color us nice. Visibility is excellent and the turning radius is nice-n-tight for in-city driving/parking (trust me, this does matter). The stereo speakers could use a little more low end oomph, road noise is bit loud, and the seats are not as comfortable as our Infititi but otherwise we love our new Subie.",3
318,"Traded in a '99 Grand Cherokee. Better gas mileage, better rear seat legroom (also a huge improvement over the regular Cherokee's). The mile commute off blacktop gives no issues for me. Cruise control works much better on hilly highways with the CVT over a traditional transmission. Absolutely no regrets thus far.",4
319,"My driving experience so far has been pretty amazing, the steering is very sensitive and the power for this car seems better than average. The interior is appealling and so is the exterior.",4
320,"I was not too sure on this vehicle or the BMW 328. Once I found out that Mercedes eliminated Chrysler from producing their vehicles I felt much better. My vehicle was produced in Stuttgart Germany, which is great and this first run of C class vehicles were produced their also. If you wait too long you will get South African models which would make me guess on the labor quality. The ride is smooth and the acceleration is quick. The navigation and 12 speaker Harmon Kardon 7.1 audio is top notch. This is an all around great car with much more prestige than a BMW. Great job Mercedes.",4
321,"I have had this vehicle a few weeks and so far I am very happy with what I got for the money spent. The items that are noted as cons in the Edmunds review do hold true, but are not that big of deal in looking at the vehicle overall. I think the Escape handles well for an SUV and I enjoy driving it. The interior is nice and the cab is fairly quiet except when the engine is excellerating. I have only filled the tank on this vehicle 3 times so far. The first time I got 26mpg and the last two times I got 30mpg. This is a combo of freeway and city driving. I even drove it up the steep hills of San Francisco with three adults in it and still got 30mpg with good power.",3
322,Have to get use to the small engine but it runs great on the highway it will run with some of the best out there on the highway with know problems at all.,3
323,"Am extremely satisfied with 2008 FWD Taurus Limited. Car I bought doesn't have all bells/whistles available but is very nicely equipped. Car is comfortable, very roomy, economical, attractive. Fuel economy excellent for car of this size (30 mpg on highway, cruise control at 74 mph, average terrain). The trunk capacity is astounding and with rear seats and passenger front seat folded down, ability to carry large, long items superior to anything on the road of which I am aware. In short, an outstanding automobile & one that Henry would be proud of. Incidentally, the car is in his only color (black) and my favorite [two tone- (black & chrome)]",4
324,"This is for 2008 MB C300 Luxury. I traded in my wife's 2006 BMW 325 (I am glad I got rid of that disappointing car. So noisy my god the chevy 2500 diesel was quiter - no kidding). Love this C class though. Smooth, quite and fast enough for me (I am mid 40s). It does everything in Merced way. I owned the previous C (2003) and didn't like that one either. But his one is defeintly a winner. Thank you Mercedes to built this.",4
325,"Beautiful, practical, roomy and comfortable car. It states the gas mileage is 36-40 mpg. I average 31. I don't feel I accelerate to quickly so I am not sure why it doesn't get better. Also, the interior material on the dash directly in front of the shifter rubs and makes an annoying noise. I am going to take it in and see what they can do.",2
326,"Coming up on first year anniversary. Have had none, zero, zip problems with this wonderful car. Which, to me, is pretty amazing. The voice-activated navigation system is terrific, though this is my first exposure to a navigation system, so I have nothing to compare it against. Early in my ownership (first 60days) I had occasion to use the four wheel drive during an ice/sleet/snow storm. It was a little nerve-wracking because I had just shelled out for the car and I would have rather been in my 14 year old suv but it handled as advertised and I was sold. Also, when you want to blow past traffic, the 306 hp (which I've never had before) is impressive.",4
327,"After several Volvos I loved, I was impressed by the new Aura and felt it was a good value. I've owned it 6 mos. now and overall, this is a fantastic car - too many things to list that I like. Details like quiet and ambient lighting, OnStar all excellent. I have had a lot of trouble with the 19"" tires, dealer replaced all of them at least once, and they just cannot seem to get balanced smooth - the car rides crappy at 60MPH or higher, and I have been so disgusted with this that all the good things get overlooked. Its a shame, either the tires or my dealer can't get it right - they say its the way the car was designed-yeah right! GM always designs cars to vibrate at 60MPH",2
328,"We traded our 2005 BMW X5 for this 2008 Acura MDX. The BMW was good, but the Acura is surprisingly better in many ways. Actually handles better, has a quieter ride and more power than the BMW. The interior is well-designed and matches up with our previous best in class, an Audi we owned a few years ago. The cost of ownership will be only slightly higher ($39 for an oil change where the BMW was covered while under warranty), but the eventual cost should be lower. The styling is what really caught my eye. More muscular stance and presence, but more interior space.",3
329,Had a terrible accident but I was able to walk away from it thanks to the Enclave! It took the brunt of the damage and it was totaled. My insurance agent was amazed that I survived due to the condition of the outside of the vehicle. I'm going to purchase an '09 for a replacement.,4
330,Driving the 2007 Jetta is like driving a sporty luxury car. It comes with every option that I would want.,4
331,"I just got this car as a graduation present and it is amazing. I used to drive a New Beetle so i'm used to smaller cars. This is the perfect size, has amazing handling, and the GPS/nav is worth every penny.",4
332,"What an unbelievable vehicle. I've always thougt the '91 Vette was the nicest car I have ever owned. The ML 320 CDI is now number 1. With all the concern about economy and emissions, it seems diesel is better than hybrid and E85, so I wanted a diesel. This car has far surpassed my expectations. I have never found driving more exciting, and I'm still learning about all the little gadgets and conveniences. I leased this one for 33 months, but expect to buy next time.",4
333,"It looks good, performs poorly. The gas mileage is 20-21 mpg City and 23 mpg Highway. CRV has Squeaks & Rattles in car. Vehicle shifts rough from 1st to 2nd from stop, start and go. The dealer says its in electronic program transmission. CRV Pulls hard to right on road at low/high speeds. I have been to a Honda Dealer who says there is a Honda Service Bulletin out Since 01/2007 prior to the car being purchased and requires New Steering column rods/pins to be later installed which are back ordered from Honda so a proper wheel alignment can been done on a new car, what?) I was Never notified by the selling dealer prior to or after purchase, So be alert for that. Noticeable wind noise at 55 mph",1
334,"After graduating from college and getting my first ""real"" job I decided it was time to upgrade my car. I've always wanted a Murano but couldn't see spending that kind of money. I saw a commercial for the Rogue and went to check it out. Fell in love right away. It's the perfect solution to not being able to afford the Murano. I love driving it! It's a great size and easy to park which is important for me b/c I park in small parking garages in Chicago. It drives so smooth and I love that you don't feel the engine shifting (or whatever). My gas mileage isn't great.. mixed hwy/city I've had 18 mpg, but I've only filled up twice. I'm keeping an eye on it.",3
335,"I evaluated the Tribute after 400 miles earlier here. I have dutifully, every fill up, recorded fuel consumption for over 5000 miles now. The mileage is incredible and I have only done a few minor things to it --put in a K&N filter (at 4000 mi) and Mobil 1 at 3000 mi. Here are the stats: overall avg. mpg 28.5. High: 33.11 mpg, low 25.5 mpg. On last tank full, averaged 32.6 (90% highway). If I drive between 60 & 65 and get it into 5th at 30 mph, I can get 32+. Between 65 & 70, I can get 30-32 mpg. Driven between 70 & 75, 28-30 mpg is possible. Above 75, it tails off as you would expect. This has got to be the most economical small SUV with a stick shift. Very pleased with it.",3
336,"I bought the 2007 CR-V just a few days after it was released. Having previously owned an earlier model CR-V, I am thrilled with the changes they've made to this model. I've had people follow me through parking lots to get a better look and ask me questions. I've always loved Honda's, but this one's a real winner.",4
337,"Traded in my 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 for the Ford Edge. Love the looks and style and do not miss my truck like I thought I would. Has a large cargo area and very fun to drive. Not to mention the better gas mileage. I was getting an average of 15 mpg with my dodge ram and according to the digital read-out on my new edge it says avg. 33 mp! So I am assuming I am getting an average of 33 mpg with it, but then again I have only put 233 miles on it. Handles great in the mountains, going up the hills. Very roomy interior and love all the cup holders. The lever to tilt the steering wheel is a little tough to operate, keep hitting my hairclip on the headrest and the speedometer gauge is hard to see.",3
338,"Driving 130 miles + daily to and from work, I average 18.5 miles/gallon at the sweet spot of 63 miles/hour. Freeway I have gotten up to 21 max. Power is great, ride is a bit bumpy with the TRD package. Ford's interior is much better designed as far as layout. The leather seats should come with the ventilated option like the highlander. No real problems yet, emergency brake needle adjusted. Tires on the TRD hydroplane a lot, will not use the BF Goodrich next time. I should have opted for the navigation system, and forgotten about the JBL under the back seat. Interior storage room lacks, but the 6.5 foot bed is just the right size for most parking lots. All in all would I buy another, YES.",4
339,"This is my third civic. I must say that this one is my favorite. I have had the car for 10 days and have put nearly 1k miles on the odometer and the gas mileage is dead on. The comfort over my previous 04 model is greatly improved due to longer wheel base especially over bumps. The front seats appear to have more legroom which is always nice. Overall I am very satisfied with my car. I got a great deal on my new car and my last Civic a 2004 EX sedan with 52K miles only depreciated $3k. I have been able to trade about every 3 year and get a new car. I love the low depreciation, reliability, overall spunkiness and quality that I have not been able to find elsewhere.",4
340,We just recently purchased a Dodge Nitro and love it! It has great performance and the car turns some heads with it's classy design. The gas mileage is great for an SUV. I drive 50 miles one way to work and back so I need good mileage! I have to say I'm very impressed so far with my Nitro and highly recommend it to anyone.,4
341,"This is a great car - period. Honda has done an excellent job of reinventing the hatchback concept for the new millenium. Two roadtrips (ATL-DC and ATL-SC) so far and no complaints. Car is fairly quick, responsive and smooth, reminds me of a BMW to drive (except I'm getting 36 MPG at 80 MPH). In general, I favor European cars (BMWs, Mercs, VWs, etc) - but Honda has done an excellent job of integrating an intelligently-designed vehicle (great safety features, innovative cargo handling, excellent fuel economy) with outstanding road feel, handling and suspension.",4
342,"First Honda I have owned but my 2 sons have both driven hondas. They were right about the seats, they are some of the most comfortable I have ever had in a vehicle. Almost 3000 miles so far and have averaged 30+mpg every tank. It's real hard to keep the revs under 6000. When you reach that point its almost like a turbo kicking in. Sticks to the road and takes the curves like a race car. Love to push this thing around the twists. Firm ride but not choppy, great sound system, it really rocks. I had the aero kit installed and it looks great super sporty in ralleye red. Nothing but compliments on the looks. Overall a great combination of performance and economy.",4
343,This van is louder than my 1 ton truck. Dealer said they all sound that way. Interior gets to easily dirty and scuffed. Van gets not much more mpg. Than my 1 ton 4 wd truck.,1
344,"I really want to like this car, but I can't help feeling I made a horrible decision here. There's nothing actually WRONG with this car, it's just that after a few months driving it, I've realized that I've just bought a pretty standard economy car, the number one issue being that it's no fun to drive at all. It has good power for such a cheap car, but unfortunately it's suspension is way too soft, it leans too much in corners, and it's isolated from the road like a sedan, instead of a sports coupe. I like to hear some noise and feel some bumps, and I like hard solid suspension so I feel confident in corners. Put the Mazda3's suspension on this car and it'd be perfect for the price.",2
345,"You can actually see the fuel gauge move in this vehicle. I have owned vehicles in most all styles & from all different car companies over the past 40+ years. Up until I got this nitro with the 3.7 v-6, I have always loved Chrysler products. I was even a loyal Chrysler man back in the 1970's/ when ""build quality"" was just a word in the dictionary at Chrysler. Overall I am unhappy w/ this vehicle. I should have gotten the hemi, as it could not drink any more gas than this 3.7 does. This vehicle get the worse fuel economy of any of any vehicle that I have ever owned or driven. The 3.7 is also low on power, if you intend to make a pass, you better plan ahead & allow lots of room.",1
346,"I had previously sold this vehicle and fell in love with the features and reliability. I finally was able to purchase one, drives like a dream with the get up and go of a 2006 Maxima (I know). This vehicle is so smooth to drive and handles good at excessive speeds, even around turns. Definitely worth every penny, and a total head turner, Altima has out-done itself yet again. The only thing I have found that is hard to get used to is the CVT, it sounds weird accelerating.",3
347,"Ford Edge is a great value for a roomy 5 passanger crossover suv. I have a large carseat in the center backseat, and I can still fit two adults pretty comfortably back there. Good Leg/head room. It is a fun car to drive. It has smooth strong exelleration. Easy to park. Even in tight mall parking lots, its very nible. MPG's are pretty good on the highway, when I'm on cruse I get about 25mpg. The crossovers I was considering were: Acadia, Murano, and FX35. I think the Edge is the best looking externally. The interior is not the best of the bunch, but is funtional, comfortable, and well put together.",3
348,Love the car except the electronics. Console buttons shorted out from windex used to clean off finger prints. Really bad design as the buttons are not sealed and will short out with only a couple of drops. Audi will not stand behind. Cost $1000 to replace in the first 6 months. Afraid to use the cup holders that are located above the elect. 2 drops and another $1000. pule the hassle. Want my Range Rover back.,1
349,"I purchased the X3 in Germany and have had the pleasure of driving 100+ mph on the autobahn for the last 3 months... sooo fun!! Handles like a dream, both in snow and on dry pavement. Steering is quick and responsive. The inside is roomy and quite comfortable. The size is perfect... large enough to pack everything I need and more, yet small enough that parking (even in Germany) is no problem. I didn't get the navigation system because I already had a Tomtom. I ordered a side dash mount from ProClip so the GPS doesn't take up space on the windscreen and the placement is excellent. Top quality vehicle!!",4
350,"Love it so far. We tested similar foreign and domestic vehicles, and found the Sorrento to be the best value overall. It has everything we need for a family of four. The instrument panel has a clean look and the dashboard controls are simple and straightforward. The ride is quiet at all speeds, and so far is very comfortable in the seating area. For this size vehicle, the cargo area is adequate for everyday use, and the rear fold down seats are easy to operate. The powertrain is strong and easily accelerates even at highway speeds.",4
351,"After driving foreign built vehicles for the last 18 years, I came across this car at $3000 below blue book and bought it. Had I bothered to check that this garbage can had depreciated $15000 in 3 years, I would have passed. But alas, I didn't, and now I have the pleasure of fixing all the KNOWN GM design problems in the steering column, brake rotors, steering rack, and struts. I have had 1960 era cars with better steering and suspension systems. Of course because GMC is an American company, it is based on greed and not customer care; they refuse to fix/recall any of these problems because not enough people have died in the car. I look forward to the day when I can unload this lemon!",0
352,The 2007 Scion tC is a great car. The ride Is awesome and the look of the car is adorable. The additional features that you can add are very affordable and very eye catching.,4
353,Had the car a little more than 3 weeks. 2.0T w/ S-Line. Test drove the 3.2 but it felt too heavy with the 6 cyl. and quattro. Plenty of kick in the 4 cyl. The S Tronic shifters are responsive and addictive.,3
354,I have taken my Focus on a trip already this year and put 3000 kms on it (1500 hundred miles) and I found it to be very comfortable with no problems to speak of yet. I got about 32 mpg which im very happy with and can honestly say I enjoy my car very much and the compliments are not to hard to listen to either. The car has just about every option you can get on it and I would recommend this car to anybody. Even my friends who aren't huge Ford fans have nothing but good to say about it.,4
355,"I bought my Charger as my retirement present to myself. I LOVE IT!. I added a K&N cold air box and laminar flow air inlet. It was supposed to add 20 HP, I don't think it did, but it sounds GREAT! The car is Tor-red, with the chrome clad wheels. I'm constantly being stopped to talk about it. I have 20K miles on it, and have only done oil changes and tire rotation. Great acceleration, fun cornering. I don't drive it much in the snow, but when I did, the computer did a good job with the wheel spin. I live in a rural-sub urban area, I get 20-22 mpg depending how close I get to the city. Much better mileage at 55 than 70 mph (over 30mpg at 55, 26mpg at 70). Try it out.",4
356,Just bought the car. Put about 1500 miles on her. Runs great. Don't really care about the interior. Bought it just for outside look and performance. Drifted around 80 degree turn at 80mph. Handles great! This is a sports car.....Not made for comfort. Don't buy if you want comfort. I bought it for drifting.,3
357,"I purchased the GV for my wife due to the ever rising gas prices and let me be the first to say ""We are impressed!"" . I never thought I would ever own a Suzuki, but this mid sized SUV has it all. Now if you are looking for V8 power, buy a V8 but the 2.7L V6 has enough power to get ya' down the road. The GV is loaded with extras that most others charge for! We are getting 17/19mpg in the city and we have not taken a road trip yet. I'll report on that later. Can't complain about the handeling or size I am 6' and I have no trouble getting in or outof the GV. Heck, Just go test drive one and see for yourself. The car sold itself!",4
358,I was a little hesitant to lease an American car but to my surprise the Edge exceeded my expectations. I looked at the Murano and the Pacifica among other but the Edge seemed to beat them all. The handling is great and it is fun to drive. The backseat is very spacious and there is plenty of storage room in the rear.,4
359,"I've been driving an A6 for seven years and wanted to upgrade to an A8, but the price point was more than I wanted to spend, so the Q7 was a great alternative - A8 size and comfort with the A6 price tag. It is very luxurious inside and out and the 4.2 V8 accelerates nicely, though not as quickly as my A6 2.7T. The 3rd row seat is not for anyone over 5'3"", but I only plan to use it sparingly and it folds down easily to provide ample storage. My golf clubs can fit sideways (unlike in the A6 or A8). One complaint is the ride is a little stiff and I can feel the bigger bumps in the road. I have 20"" wheels, but didn't opt for the adaptive air suspension (darn).",3
360,"I was fortunate in finding a 2008 Highlander Hybrid Limited in one of the colors that I wanted, Iced Amethyst Mica, and equipped the way I wanted it, everything but Nav and RES, that wasn't either special ordered for someone or already claimed! I picked it up last night, so it's a little early to make any firm commitments about anything, but so far we're off to a great start. I've not noticed any build or fit and finish issues and I am pretty meticulous about these things. Driving it is a pleasure and makes me intensely curious about what, exactly, is going on 'under the hood.' This will be a vehicle that's fun to drive and will also keep me intrigued for a long time to come.",3
361,"Bought this piece of American junk in 08. So far the doors have needed work, the heater/ac blower motor works intermittently, the dealer of course cant find a problem. Just got the front brakes done at 23,000 miles. My guess is the use of sub grade materials, poor acceleration on highway, brake calipers frozen on rear brakes and dealership tells me it could be a week before they come in. My hope is Chrysler disappears from the business. I will never buy another. Completely sickened by the company and their unwillingness to fix any problem unless it's out of the warranty period. Bunch of crooks...",0
362,"We like our Focus. The mileage is 41 highway & 30 city, very good for an automatic. Have a squeak in suspenison is hand brake cable in hanger in front of rear axle. Ford has a fix a new grommet. We think it is a very good buy for the price. Looked at Toyota, Nissan, Vibe, Mazda",3
363,"Fun to drive. Get the protection package to prevent unwanted rattles and noises, it protects your paint too. The sports package gives it a great look. This car is perfect for all age groups. I read a lot of reviews before purchasing and noticed a lot of people said the seating was uncomfortable. I have not had that problem (my previous vehicle was a 4Runner so that's really all I can compare it to but I find it comfy). The car looks so small from the outside that it's hard to believe how much space is inside. I love it!",4
364,"Waited for 2008 model because of the wind noise, grabby brakes I read for 2007, but I have this car for a month now and I don't see any of these complaints. The LS 460 is smoother, slightly quieter and faster than my 2001 LS 430, although there is a little engine noise on low speed which I think is the current design. The brakes are as good or better than my LS 430. The rear seat leg room is more than enough. I don't see this small footrest complaint for 07, this car is simply the best.",4
365,"Relentless acceleration, great engine sound, and fantastic handling. Regular mode for automatic is like an economy mode in normal driving. Sport mode feels like a manual in that it holds a gear and quickly downshifts. Do not really use paddle shifters very much.There is plenty of room in front and the rear is acceptable if average size. Rear is difficult to access. Top mounted seat position adjusters are very handy for this. Careful driving results in excellent gas mileage. Ride is acceptable, and would be much better without run flats. Great visibility and very nice interior. At first sport seats seemed confining, but now they feel very comfortable. I enjoy each chance I have to drive it.",3
366,"The Honda fit brings something new to the world of compacts; standards. Everything that was called an option before is now standard. Loads of airbags, ABS power windows, the works. Its all standard. Sure somethings could have been better, but for the most part, having standards doesn't make me ask the dealer to fetch a model that has all the features I want. Only drawback is that I don't see myself using this car for a cross country road trip although the loads of space and adjustable seats does suggest that it would be a good idea. Great for a daily commuter.",4
367,"I was at a car show while on business in Birmingham, Al. I called my wife and insisted that she go online to check out this car. The next day she was at a dealership in Fort Lauderdale and by the time I got home she owned this car. I can't stop driving it because its just so much fun. Forget about the negative reviews, you must drive for yourself. The trunk space is not bad. We used a soft luggage and was able to pack enought stuff for two days. The 3 hour trip to Keywest was just awesome, fun, exciting, and we had to flip a coin on who was going to be the driver. The OnStar (turn-by- turn), XM radio, and telephone (great reception) is just great. Saturn you did great on this one. A+ baby.",4
368,"After a year of research, we purchase this van in late June. I am thrilled with my decision! What solidified my decision to purchase this van was the crash-test ratings from iihs.org. Finally, an automaker made a van I had real confidence in. After looking at the Kia Sedona, we decided on the Entourage simply because of its sporty look- I preferred the brushed metal to the cheesy looking faux wood. We bought the LIMITED edition with the sunroof package; ours came with floormats. This van is a dream to drive, the fit and finish are top-notch, and I look even smarter because I saved a bundle! I am little disappointed with gas mileage (15 MPG vs 18), but my daughter is safe, so it's forgivable.",3
369,This is my second mini. The clutch went out in the first one after 2 1/ years years and only 22000 miles. The cause was determined to be a manufacture defect and was covered. My 2008 Mini S has only 10727 miles and is a standard transmission too. The clutch began slipping on this one. It is currently at the dealer and I am waiting to hear if the repairs are covered. I do not ride the clutch and do not drive aggressively or even need to shift that often (not a lot of stop and go traffic). I have read many posts on other sites about mini's and clutch problems. Buyer be ware!!!,1
370,"This is my 5th toyota purchase and my first truck. I purchased the prerunner access cab 4cyl 5sp with the convenience package. It cost me $19,300 with 3 years of zero financing. Even though I liked the older body style this was a no brainer purchase. I wanted a truck that looked good and got decent gas mileage(20 to 25). It's like the old tacoma on steriods. It should last me quite awhile.",3
371,"I have recently purchased my Civic not too long ago, and so far it has been great, but it can be better. It looks great inside and out. Though it would be better inside if they used better quality plastics and made it more solid. Performance-wise, it delivers! Very zippy around urban streets and easy to maneuver in parking lots. The Vtec engine provides ample power smoothly. However, I am not getting good mileage in a car that is rated to do a around the mid 30 mpg range. In normal driving (with little heater/AC, non aggressive driving) I am getting a little less than 20 mpg. No repairs was done or needed, and the only real gripe is a bunch of rattling noises coming from the interior. Great car!",4
372,"I drove a 1996 Acura 3.2TL before buying the Avalon after comparing new Nissan Maxima, slightly used Acura RL 2006, slightly used Infiniti M35. What sold me was the comfortable and quiet ride and the available feature set. It didn't hurt that Toyota takes regular gas AND gets better mileage than other large cars. I don't understand the other reviewer citing difficulty with entry/exit into the car; seems like that's something one would notice prior to purchase and, if it is that significant of a problem, look elsewhere. The car rocks; great stereo, silky transmission, great power, bluetooth is easy to use, still learning navigation, but seems intuitive enough. Overall, A+",4
373,"This is a good looking (in and out), nimble, smaller sized crossover. It feels very solid on corners, has decent passing power (5 speed manual), and comfortable seating for a 6 ft adult.",3
374,"I have owned a LX for about a month now and have been pleasantly surprised at the gas economy and reliability so far. Most of the miles so far are on the highway (with the A/C on) and I have consistently obtained 34+ MPG, with the maximum so far being 37.8 MPG. The vehicle handles very well on the highway, but can be a bit awkward at low speeds. Does not handle turns very well, even at low speeds. Feels like the car is going to rollover if you take those curved exit ramps at more than 30 to 35 mph. But overall, considering the price, I am a very satisfied owner.",3
375,"After driving a mini-van for quite awhile, I was so excited about driving a truck again! In shopping around, we narrowed our choices down to the Yukon, Tahoe, and Armada. Fortunely, we fell upon a rebate that we just couldn't resist on the Yukon! I Love it! It has worked out very well for my children as well. There is plenty of elbow room for them. The rear A/C has been a lifesaver in our Texas heat! It runs smoothly, looks great, and gives us a secure feeling that we are well protected. The gas mileage could be better but we knew that when we bought it. The stereo is great and the instrument panel is well designed. OnStar, XM radio, and remote controls are wonderful. I highly recommend it!",4
376,"I am an insurance adjuster and this is my company car and I drive it hard. I currently have about 67000 miles on it and have had numerous problems with it mechanically. At 30K the trans began shifting hard, took it to the dealer and had the throttlebody replaced. At 50K the steering was loose and was pulling hard, had the left lower ball joint (which only came with the control arm) and the steering gear replaced. At 65K the same trans problem and they again replaced the throttlebody. Another adjuster has had similar problems with the steering/suspension. Also, 3.0 is not that powerful. You might have better luck as an everyday commuter instead of a workhorse like me.",2
377,From an SUV to an IS and I don't miss a thing. The IS is a funny car that packs a good punch and its not a bad looker either.,3
378,"Being my first SUV, I've tried quite a few out; the Rav-4, the CR-V, Ford Escape, and little did I know the 2008 Vue was available. Upon going to the dealership, my fiancee and I took a test drive and we were sold. The vehicle looks much like a higher-class SUV rather than the cheaper 2007 model. The drive is great, comfortable, and extremely enjoyable. I've been pleasantly surprised by the drive and quality of this car, and everywhere you look, there's something new you discover about it. I'd easily recommend this to friends and family.",4
379,"I purchased this brand new 2008 LE V6 at the end of 2008. Within a week the seat and steering wheel would vibrate when driving 65-75 on the highway 30 miles to get to work. Also had issues with the bluetooth. Brought in repeatedly. Eventually a TSB was sent out by Toyota regarding vibration/shudder after months of complaining, but it didn't completely resolve the issue. Toyota Rep insists it's the way Camry is designed. Had Honda's for 20 years, first toyota, incredibly disappointed. Do not feel safe. Also experience transmission hesitation as others.",0
380,"This is my second Wrangler first was a 1995..sold it and now bought a 2007 with only 12,000 miles. The Wrangler is my weekend fun machine. The ride is comfy and stereo is awesome. The top is way easy to drop and put up. I upgraded the wheels and tires, not the suspension because it doesn't need it in my opinion. I don't extreme off road. The new design is by far the best because it's still looks the same just bigger and better than previous years.",3
381,"I love this car. For being a young female it's great, a lot better than my old Escort. It does need a little help though. I don't have a lot of rear seat passengers but they could've given the rear more leg room. Very roomy in front. Only problem I'm having is with the brakes. Yes, after 6500 miles the rotors got warped. Composite rotors with semi metallic pads don't combine well. It's a nice little car for me, rides smooth (other than the brake issue), good on gas and comfy for a tall person like me. Decent style outside for the price. I paid for what I got. Not much to complain about with it.",3
382,"Would like more hp when accelerating to get onto freeway or pass another vehicle, vehicle is a little sluggish in that area. Fuel economy is o.k., 17 mpg city. Otherwise overall excellent ride so far.",3
383,"The smart is definitely fun to drive, and has excellent mileage. My best tank so far, driving conservatively on the highway, has been 53 MPG. Realistically one should expect high 30s to mid 40 MPGs, depending on driving. Mileage suffers above 65 MPH as the drag increases. The quirky transmission is the car's greatest weak spot. It is neither as smooth as a traditional auto, nor as quick to change gears as a manual. It literally takes a certain learning curve to get used to it and get smoother. Nevertheless, the car is super fun to drive. If you don't want to wait a full year for a reservation, get on your local dealer's ""orphan"" list for cars that have been turned down.",3
384,"I have had this truck for a few months now, and have little complaints. The common complaint here is fuel consumption. It is a truck with a V8, what did you expect? Some people just need the power and room, and that will cost you in fuel costs. If you are looking for 30 MPG, get a VW. Space is great and there are a load of great features. The all time 4WD drive is great for my wife. All the safety, and I don't have to worry about her screwing up the transfer case by shifting wrong. My suggestion is to buy it used. The depreciation for a new Durango is ridiculous, like $10,000 the first year. You can get a $40,000 truck for half the price if you go one year old.",3
385,"The driving has been great and the experience has been good, the only thing I feel not right is that in order to have basic features like power lock and power windows, I needed to pay extra, it is not included and in today's world those feature are a must!",3
386,"I have owned this car for about a year now. Owned a Tucson prior and it was in the shop right away. I was given a Sonata as a loaner and loved it, so I ended up trading in the Tucson for a 2008 Sonata. I read these reviews and wanted to comment. This is a great car for the price, it absolutely is great in the snow, can not say the same for the Tucson. However, I do have to agree with another post. When you have the heat on the floor, it comes out through the upper vents, but I have found if you close them, it forces it more to the floor. Also, it has alot of rattles in it, but so does my husbands year old Toyota.",3
387,"Bought a Freestyle limited June 2007 and almost a year later had to trade it in. From day one we had a constant gas smell. Took it in and half a tank of gas later could find no problem. Kept driving it and smell got worse. Mpg highway was around 18, City was 15 at best. Winter was terrible because it would get stuck in 1/2 inch of snow. We had the pebble leather and it reflected in the front window very badly.",1
388,"When I was selected to ""ride & drive"" the Astra back in early October I was a little sceptical about how this car would be next to the lackluster Ion I was blown away. This car has all the looks and amenities of a car costing many thousands more, the handling is also phenomonal compared to the Ion. I think Saturn has built a real winner and that they will be a serious contender in the small hatchback segment.",4
389,"I've been a fan of the Corvette as long as I remember, but this is my first one. Comparing it to anything else I've ever driven... well, I just can't. It outperforms them all in just about every way. Obviously, it is a sportscar and no one can deny it's performance (even not considering it's price). I shopped several european vehicles and looked at a couple of Asian models. The only thing close of US manufacturer's are the Viper (not civil enough for me) and the Cadillac, which is a heavier underpowered Corvette. Nothing compared. Acceleration is incredible, handling sublime, but what I'm most impressed with is the comfort. I'm 6'3"" and feel comfortable enough to enjoy a 10 hr trip",4
390,"I have owned many cars, including , several corvettes, Fords, Honda (the worst car I ever owned), and many GM, mopars, light trucks and vans. This is my first review about a vehicle. With out a doubt, Buick Enclave is the finest crossover ever. Car is as smooth and quiet as any car you will find, smother, quieter than my sons new Lexus. I am averaging 17.8mpg around town, one small trip got 25.4mpg. High quality and attention to detail make it extra special. You should consider the back up camera as backing visibility is restricted by design. I traded a Tahoe which I loved but I am over it. Navagation system not as good as good as Garmin. GM should build all its cars like this",4
391,I just purchased the Rabbit and I love it. It's my first VW and my first german car. Before this I had a Integra GS-R and I get the same if not better gas mileage in my Rabbit. This car has more torque than that car so it gets up and goes right away.,4
392,"I used to own a Mercedes and let me tell you, is fantastic. The Cadillac CTS' looks, performance, build quality, and comfort, are all superior to the Mercedes-Benz C-Class.",4
393,"First of all I love this car. I looked at Lexus and infiniti. I just loved the CTS. So I took a two year lease on this one. I got it fully loaded. I did have problems with the dealer. The first salesman I spoke to left, then the second sales person quit. I was on a role, but i still bought it and I am happy I did. I ended up with a great guy, he was trying to make up for a bad situation.",4
394,"I am thoroughly impressed with my Mazdaspeed 6. I did a lot of research on the vehicle comparing the TSX, Accord, Camry, Legacy, and Altima. I ultimately chose the Mazda because it simply outperforms any of the other sedans I drove. This car neatly combines the fit and feel of a classy sedan and the performance of an AWD sports car. Perfect for me! The price point is 10-20k less than sedans which offer similar performance such as the BMW or Audi. If you are a person who does not need to brag about owning a BMW or Audi then this car may be great for you.",4
395,"The Fit is fantastic. I needed something fuel efficient, and something to transport dogs and bikes. I looked at other hatchbacks, new and used, and this seemed like the most bang for the buck, even brand new. I was in awe at the amount of interior space for such a tiny-looking car. With the back seats folded flat, I can fit 2 bikes, luggage, 2 dogs and 2 people! I can also fit both dogs in the back/hatchback area and 4 people in the car simultaneously. I have friends that borrow the Fit to move furniture (chairs, dressers) - something typically reserved for trucks, but the Fit can handle it!",4
396,"This is the first SUV I have ever owned and never understood the attraction until now. I have been a continuous Ford owner since I was a teenager and I own a number of Fords including a 1964 T-Bird, 1995 Lincoln Mark 8, 2002 Lincoln LS V8, 2002 T-Bird and now the Edge AWD LTD. This vehicle is comfortable, quiet, solid and well equipped. The exterior and interior styling is beautiful with the leather interior and it rides like my Lincolns.",4
397,Great truck. Fit and finish excellent and have received many compliments in the short period I have owned it. All aspects of the vehicle top shelf and the best in any pickup I have owned. (5 so far) Gas mileage about 16.8 around town which what I was getting in my SUV. Example of great American engineering..Chevrolet,4
398,This car is beautifully styled and lots of pep. The older models had a blind spot on the rear passenger side. There is great visibility with this model.,2
399,"This is one of finest compact cars on the market today. The features that this car offers are absolutely phenomenal. I initially checked out other compact cars such as the Dodge Caliber, Toyota Matrix, Pontiac Vibe, and Nissan Sentra. I have to admit that each of those cars left me desiring and seeking much more. Then I decided to check out the Kia Spectra 5 and that was the best decision I could have made. The car was everything I was looking for in a compact car. The look was sporty. The exterior quality was extremely obvious. The interior was loaded with features that even some bigger cars and SUVs didn't have. Then came the drive. I was sold and the car was mine. Thank you Kia.",4
400,"The more miles the car gets on the odometer the better gas mileage is achieved. Important point The car's computer gas mileage is off by 4-5 miles. In a hybrid, the trick is to drive like a grandmother.",2
401,"This vehicle is an upgrade from my 2001 Honda Accord. I purchased my Highlander the day after New Year and i couldn't be more pleased. Bought it in NC and brought it to VA. I put the vehicle to test on Blue Ridge Parkway and gotta say that the Highlander handled the curves and the slopes gracefully. With the exception of the Blue Ridge Parkway, I am impressed with the highway mileage. At one particular stretch of 80 miles, I averaged 29.4 MPG. Unbelievable! The ride though not close to Lexus 350, still feels luxurious and safe. It sure rides like a sedan, but more comfortably.",3
402,"With 32,500 miles I've never been happier with a truck. I've owned Ford, Chevy (2), and Dodge trucks. The only thing that comes close to the Tundra was a Duramax. Driving the Tundra feels like the Duramax, just I can't tow as much. I installed the KN Cool Air Intake, gives it even more hp and sounds cool.",4
403,Before I purchased my Susuki I drove a Lexus RX300. I could not afford to buy another Lexus but wanted all the bells and whistles of my Lexus. I would never thought to have even test drove a Susuki but when I did I was hooked. I knew that I was going to purchase the car. I have two kids and love the 3rd row seating. The storage is great. It has a lot of pep and my husband likes the duel exhaust. I really like the interior. I love the red and white lights. I actually like the window switches in the middle console. I know some people in other reviews did not like that...to each their own. I would at least recommend someone to test drive the Susuki XL7 before making a final purchase.,4
404,"I am on my third Vue. (I have had 04,06 and now 08)It has been a very reliable vehicle though without much pizazz until now, the 2008 has really captivated my attention. The interior and exterior are beautiful its very quiet and is very exciting to drive. My other Vues were nice but not stylish. The 08' has more than enough horsepower to leave most vehicle in the dust which is not usual for a small SUV. Definitely worth checking out. the Vue has been very reliable I expect the same from this new version.",3
405,"This generation Civic is the best to date. I owned a 1996 Civic for just over 12 years; I loved it before the wreck. I was just shy of 240,000 miles. My 2008 Civic is even better, more refined, comfortable, powerful and better looking. And most of all still have all the attributes that loved about my first Civic. To anyone who has driven other small cars in this class, it's the best. To those who are down grading from cars like a BMW 3 series, come on, this is a Civic and goes for 20 grand less, don't compare.",4
406,"I loved this car... Now I just can't wait to give it back! Seems like the problems just get worse. Air bag light is always on ... Got tired of getting it fixed. Electric Windows seem to have a mind of their own. Then the wipers, lets just say I had to change the motor. Now I have a epc starting problems... That no one seems to be able to figure it out. After reading all these reviews has me worrying able my brake pads... I guess it will never end until I get rid of this car :(",1
407,"I bought my Cobalt a year ago and still LOVE it! I had always driven v8's so was a little concerned about going to a 4 cyl, but was very surprised with how much power it actually has. It also handles very well. I live on back country roads and it takes curves wonderfully. Plenty of trunk space makes traveling easy. Also has a GREAT stereo system. The remote start is also great for warming up or cooling down the interior before getting. The back seat is a little tight though.",3
408,"This is my third Hyundai, my two others were Sonata's. I loved both of those but after upgrading to the Azera this is by far more bang for the buck than BMW,Lexus or any other high end car this size. I'm getting 28-30 mpg on rural roads at 45-50 mph and 32-36 highway at 70mph.Powerful 3.8 ltr and great mileage to boot! Try and find one coming off lease and save big$$$$$.",4
409,"We looked at all the competitors in its class and the Astra by far was #1 in all the areas we looked at. Once I got in it and drove it, I was totally hooked. The feel of the interior is like sitting in a Volvo. High quality in and out. Just close the doors and hear the solid ""thud"". The shift of the 5 speed is solid and smooth! We have already put 3000 miles, over the mountains in Phoenix and love the way it handles! The sun roof is a big plus! Don't get one without it.",4
410,"Lifelong owner of sport sedans from Far East or Europe. Living out a childhood vision of owning a sports car with a great American V8. Car is engineered around the powerful engine, not much else. Unlike products from other domestic makers, the understated styling and lack of cheezy exterior add-on is quite appealing. Obviously, this is a recreational vehicle, so it does not dissappoint, great engine sound, accelaration is pretty linear, and suspension is a good compromise. Not meant to make social statement, so no complaints about ~15 to 24 mpg. Overall, not a perfect car, and not for everyone, but just a fun personal toy to have in your garage.",3
411,"I have been driving this car for 3 months now. I average 22.5 MPG in mostly suburban driving, with a roundtrip distance to work of 20 miles each day. I also use it to deliver papers in every morning, which takes about 30 minutes. I use to do the same routine in a Honda Civic which had a larger engine and got 30 MPG. So I am very disapointed with the fuel economy. Even open road driving you can watch that gas gauge visibly drop. You cannot lock the driver side door except by using the key - this is a pain when you have bundles to carry and/or its raining.",1
412,"It's been almost 2 months since I've owned the Camry Hybrid. I've been getting an average of 37 mpg after 4 fill-ups. This car has all the features and technology that you can find only in luxury cars like Lexus and Acura. I've changed my driving style since I started driving it. I no longer put the pedal to the metal on green lights, I drive at the speed limit and I try to use electric only whenever possible. Also, I started to laugh at the big fat SUVs and how much gas they're wasting as the speed past me. :)",4
413,"I've owned Fords, Chryslers, VWs, Audis, and I can tell you, this is the best car I've owned. I have a fully loaded hybrid Camry, I am proud for what I am doing for the environment and also very pleased with the money savings. The car itself is beautiful, quiet, comfortable. With this transmission you cannot tell when it is shifting, sometimes you think the engine is not running, it is sooo quiet. Suspension is great, comfortable. Brakes are also very good. Interior is roomy, comfortable and packed with amenities. This family car is in fact very fun.",4
414,"An excellent car. We rented the Azera for a trip around the Northwest. I was initially skeptical about having a Hyundai (even with only 7 miles on it), but that wore off immediately. We could fit 5 suitcases, a full size stroller (folded) in the trunk and two kids in the back seat comfortably. Our round trip was from Portland, around the Olympic Peninsula, to Seattle and back to Portland. Whether cruising on 101 or climbing mountain roads to over 5000 feet, the Azera gave a smooth, comfortable, and powerful ride. MPG was quite reasonable for a full size car.",4
415,"My first MB and I now understand all the hype surrounding German engineering. The attention to details, the technology, brute performance, and respectable handling and braking for a luxury sports sedan. It will take a top of the line S600 or E65 to pass you and cost a whole lot less. I really enjoy all the conveniences and I am quickly getting a handle on the voice activated Command System. Keyless Go really is a nice feature. The AMG sport package really adds a nice touch. Operating the 7 speed auto via FI style paddle shifters really makes it feel like a performance vehicle. The safety features are not to be ignored. A fun car to drive!",4
416,"I have owned many American and Foreign SUVs in the past, but the BMW X5 far surpasses my expectations with comfort, technology, gas economy and just plain fun to drive!",4
417,Just purchased an new 2008 Denali and I am loving this vehicle. The grade of leather and the amount of features make driving almost like flying a jet. Engine has great acceleration and the interior of the car is very plush.,4
418,"I read the reviews, did my research, and bought the car I've always wanted. I've only had it for 4 days. Things I love. The car is comfortable, easy to drive. I love the camera back up feature and the aux for my iPod. Taking my first road trip tomorrow and I can't wait to get it on the open freeway.",3
419,"After turning in a 2004 Caddy this car is lots of fun. Very surprised so far. Gas mileage in town is not good! Highway was much better. Only problem, rear of XR should have rear seat armrest and also a AC duct for rear A/C to get to! Minor additions but great value to rear passengers. Sound system is great! Only interior part that looks cheap is the interior door panels, other than that great car for the money. Can't compare that to anything out there.",3
420,"Got the 08 Limited Edition Liberty at fire sale prices in October. What a fun, fun car. We live in the Northeast and the car handled all the snowy weather beautifully. But the sunny days allowed that Sky Slider Roof to really brighten your day. The car came with Sirius radio free for 1 year (cool!), leather heated seat and factory installed remote start (again, think harsh PA winters). All the chrome makes the Liberty look cool and the two kids still in car seats still have a good amount of room.",3
421,"The GOOD: Wife was sold on a Scion Xa before I insisted she take a Versa test drive. She bought the first Versa the dealer sold. Impressive power w/6spd, fun to drive & great interior room & materials. The BAD: A/C compressor failed 2nd day. Took factory 1 month to replace. A/C now sounds like a dentist's drill @3000 RPM. TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM {TPM):Has been in Dealer shop for re- set 3 times in 2 months w/no low/high tire pressure detected. Consider an extended warranty if this problem is not addressed under a Nissan re-call. Online correspondence reflects an ongoing TPM problem among Versa owners. Hopefully Nissan will address this ongoing problem. $100 cost per re-set.",2
422,"First Honda I have ever owned. I have always had trucks (Fords f-150's). Really miss my truck, but man do I like going over 420 miles and only spending $37.00 in gas (just filled up today)! My truck would have cost me over $90.00! Love it!!!!",4
423,"I love my Yaris. It has all the equipment I wanted in a new car, gets great gas mileage, it's a blast to drive and it's a freakin Toyota so I can rely on it for years and years to come. At first I was skeptical of the Yaris and never thought that I would own one. I kept thinking that I could never go back to a little car, especially coming out of a '95 Olds. sedan. But the more I complained about the gas mileage my tank of a car was getting, the more appealing the Yaris became. Not to mention the price point is just as attractive as the styling.",4
424,"Overall I do like the car. It is fun to drive and has surprisingly good visibility (except on backing up). I like the look of the car both interior and exterior. In terms of pts for improvement: car has mediocre pickup. Seats aren't comfortable. I find my back hurts after just 20-25 minutes of driving. I've also encountered a number of problems that should have been worked out prior to release. If not, they should at least be flexible in dealing with the issue but they're not. We bought 2 Hondas at the same time, the CR-V and a Civic. Really wishing we just got 2 Civics. The Civic drives far better and so far has no issues. And it's significantly cheaper.",3
425,"Traded a 2005 Silverado Crew Cab for the Nissan, and have been very pleased so far. Excellent power and smooth shifts. Hauls wife & kids like a full- size car, but carries anything you can throw in the back or hook to the hitch. Very comfortable seats and roomy cab with great options. Would prefer an auto 4WD mode and a Neutral on the transfer case, as well as mechanical anit-spin differentials instead of the brake system. Love the R-F sound system and the DVD entertainment. Could do without the 20"" rims and low-profile tires as I prefer capability over bling. Have had a couple minor issues, but I've had that with every truck I've ever owned.",3
426,"Have had pickups and large suvs past 20 years. Finally gave up f150. This Escape is so fun to drive, comfortable and quiet cpmpared to CR-V and Rav4, loaded and only cost 21000, v6 and 4wd. So far 22 mpg, better if cruise not used. Interior finish is neat, and exterior is sharp and finish is superb. We like this so much we are thinking of trading wife's Expedition for another.",4
427,First 2001 Highlander was superior to my 2008. Poor visibility. Seat is so uncomfortable hate to drive for any length of time. 2008 does not handle as well as prior model. No traction in the snow. Mine is an AWD 6 cyl. Interior parts fall off. Very disappointed with 2008 Highlander.,0
428,"I am really happy with my Compass (purchased 7/13/06). The name was a little hard to remember at first but since I starting calling her ""Compass Rose"" the name fits perfectly. Funny though the car is NOT equipped with a compass. I traded in my '99 Jeep Cherokee Classic so, needless to say the ride is smooth, merging into traffic is effortless even with the 2.7, 4 cylinder engine, and not remarkably slower than the 4.0 liter in my Cherokee. The interior is comfortable, plenty of room in the backseat and the back doors are very accessible. I would however, change the headrests in the rear seat, as they are a bit high and tend to restrict visibility out of the rear window. Odometer: 158 miles.",3
429,"I bought this vehicle because I have a long commute and needed something comfortable. This car more than exceeds that. Wonderful performance out of the 4 cylinder while not compromising on gas mileage. I'm averaging about 25-26 mpg in mixed highway/city driving. I've taken sharp turns at 55 mph and have gotten it up to 135 on a long straight away. Interior does not feel cheap in anyway like ""domestic"" vehicles and standard options are more than enough. I have about 15,000 miles on it already and no problems at all. I can't recommend this car enough to anyone in the midsize sedan market. I mean why buy another vehicle w/6cyl that has less HP and eats more gas as is the case w/many others.",4
430,"I will never buy another VOLVO. This car has had the engine replaced, new brakes, roof squeaks and master computer went. The car in 2 years old and has ony 10,000 miles The biggest waste of $49,000!!! Stay clear of this car",0
431,"The Denali with the AutoRide suspension feels tight and has little body roll. You get a 6-speed tranny, 380 hp, 417 torque, and every comfort feature imaginable for under 50k.",3
432,"Driving in the Canadian winter is not fun, yet the Pilot, even at -45 degrees C runs fine. The traction assist will catch you unaware on ice corners and might cause you to over-correct. The get-up-and-go on ice is fantastic! Cold starts without plugging in are no problem, and the engine warms up very quickly. Feild of view for a tall person is limited by the side pillars I find myself leaning forward and back with a lot of head movement while checking intersections.",3
433,"This is a car that can truly do it all. I was looking for a car that could fulfill my demands for having a fun, performance oriented vehicle that could simultaneously deliver respectable gas mileage, have four doors, a great warranty and not break the bank, including full coverage insurance. Oh, did I mention my non-manual transmission driving wife had to be able to drive it too? Under these strict stipulations, the GTI is absolutely sublime. I bought mine for $20.5K and spend $100 a month on full coverage insurance. I regularly get over 30 mpg on the highway and 23 mpg in town. Because of its sleeper status, I can drive it like I sat on a wasp, and a cop would be none the wiser.",4
434,"I have used this wonderful sedan for a year. It is quiet, smooth, and very comfortable.I am sure if Ford continues this direction, it will get back to its previous place in the market. I used to have many Japanese cars, and thought never bought an American one. But this Taurus (my first try on American cars) has proved that Ford can make a good car if it wanted to. The Taurus is the kind of car everyone wants: high performance, comfort, affordable price, and save a lot of gas. On my last trip from San Jose to Los Angeles, I have got 30mpg with use of the cruise control.",4
435,"Awesome car! Recently took a trip 335 miles each way, averaged 39.5 miles per gallon. The car handles well and is comfortable and relatively quiet. All the standard safety features make this car an exceptional value.",4
436,"My model has the ""information display"" with temperature, average mph and average mpg. This feature, especially the mpg can impact your driving habits. Especially with gas over $3/gal. I am more careful about quick acceleration and braking. I have a 26 mile commute to work taking 45 minutes. I average 22.5 mpg. I traveled from Philadlphia to DC and averaged 23.8 mpg. The gas mileage is better than I expected.",2
437,"Drove it on the Autobahn after European delivery in Munich all the way to Vienna - awesome power, handling and comfort. Navigation and heads up display took me right to my Vienna hotel. Car is great fun to drive and a real head turner - would strongly recommend 3/4 hours with the iDrive manual in order to fully appreciate it, particularly if used in conjunction with the steering wheel controls. Trunk handles two golf bags and rear seat is definitely functional. Heads up display and sports package a must as is upgraded stereo system. Very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this vehicle and also the European Delivery program - BMW does it right.",4
438,"I've had my Malibu LT2 for about 4 months now. I am very pleased with the car, even with the 4 banger it still is able to get up and run if i ever need it and for the gas mileage I get 30-31 highway and 26-27 mix with about 60% highway. The leather seats with the suede fabric in the middle is what sold me on the car. It is silly luxury for a car at this price. I also love the hvac and stereo controls. They look good and are very easy to understand and use. I recently had someone try to break into my car by going through the driver side front window and they were not able to break their way through the laminated glass!",4
439,"Every new Ford is better than the last, and this one is no exception. I love this car. Plenty of power, comfort, and room. At first, my friends said I bought a ""chick car"", but after riding in it, they figured out that it's quite ""gender neutral"".",4
440,"My wife and I find this to be a very good car. It is roomy, comfortable, and classy-looking. I can't understand why certain consumer magazines don't give this a thumbs up. I liked the fact that someone from the GM shop floor rang me to see how I liked it. This is a great American car - we're proud to have it.",4
441,"I have had this car for over a year and have had no problems. It is very fun to drive, and like most Ford's, it has a lot of power. Being a coupe there is still a lot of room for passengers and the trunk is huge. Small and easy to get in and out of parking spaces, especially good for college parking. Easy to control and steer. Great design inside and out. This model is much more appealing than the earlier and even later models. Overall a great buy and would not want anything else.",4
442,Outstanding fit and finish. Looked at SUV's for 6 mo and finally settled on the Sorento. Boy what a joy to drive. The looks alone make it a neat vehicle. The warranty and the dealer support is great. we love the way you sit up and the turning radius. The 262 HP is nice also. The 4 wheel dive is excellent and gets me to all my favorite fishing spots in Colorado. Buy one and you won't be disappointed.,4
443,"After years with an A4 Avant, this has not been a step down at all! I figured I would be sacrificing space and luxury for MPG and the convenience of a compact, but not really the case; roomy interior and meticulous detail (I could live without the carbon fiber trim look, however). Way easier to park in the city, better mileage, and far quicker than the A4. Overall, if you don't need the Quattro I can't see a reason to get a new A4 Avant when this option is out there.",4
444,"I started looking for something that was fun to drive and had a unique look. As soon as I pulled out of the dealership for my test drive, I fell in love with how it handled. I have taken it on a few road trips and had amazing gas mileage. My only gripe (which is actually a good thing) is that I have had to learn to be to overly cautious with blind spots because I am a little shorter. That aside, I have recommended not only my Compass but Jeeps in general to anyone and everyone who will listen. It is an amazing SUV that gets great mileage (I average 30 mpg highway), haven't had any problems with upkeep, and is it a lot of fun to drive.",4
445,I traded an 05 XLE 6c. for an 08 XLE 4c. and it has as much pep even on hills. Good gas mileage. I am very pleased with the car thus far.,4
446,"For the money you can not beat it. 4wd, very good mpg plenty of room. Looks pretty good too.",3
447,"We test drove the 350Z. It had no interior room. Then we tried the Soltice. Nope, it needs a bigger engine. The Mustang nice, but it uses old technology and gets poor gas mileage. The Mini Cooper is to yuppy. The Honda 2000 is a faster Miata, but it is too small, The Mazda RX-8 is very unconfortable. Its arm rest is too high, it has a quirky engine, and the air didn't work very well. The Toyota Solara made for Grandmas. The Corvette is too common. At last we come to the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spider. It is a fun, sporty car that my wife and I love. It's our weekend cruiser. It's fast, comfortable, sporty, and I love how the top is buried.",3
448,I bought this car as a winter/mileage maker instead of driving my 05 GTO. I average 35 mpg on country road driving. The price and warranty were excellent. I paid under 8k with incentives. If you are looking for a cheap reliable car with 100k mile warranty this is it!,4
449,"I am very happy with my new truck. Owned the 2000 1500 4X4 and put 135,000 on it with only a water pump break down but it was not enough truck to haul 2 horses. This truck sure is, I didn't realize what a difference the bigger truck would be. I have the gas engine and it is currently getting 18 mpg on the freeway same as the 1500. Towing I get about 13 mpg. Lots of get up and go with the trailer when I need it. Still getting used to the new interior design, trying to figure where to put things like sunglasses,storage under back seats is better than previous design. Ford friends say my mpg will decrease dramatically at about 60000 hope they are wrong and just looking for something to pick at.",3
450,"I would like to know how the public is being fooled about poor mileage from GM cars. I set the cruise at 55 and get 38 mpg on the instant mpg readout and at 70 mph I get 35, aprox. 26 in the city. and this isn't a tiny car. Plenty of room and I'm 6 ft 2 in. Beautiful car, absolutely quiet. A great ride. An excellent car at a great price. I highly recommend to everyone to test drive a Malibu.",4
451,"I have owned/driven all of the other brands before buying my 07 Tundra. I have owned a Ford F150, Titan, Dodge Ram, and none of these trucks compare to the new Tundra. It is more refined, powerful, comfortable, and reliable. Really, there is nothing that Toyota can do to this truck to make it better... maybe some power adjustable pedals. Overall, I am VERY impressed with this truck. The 07 Tundra is truly going to change everything and everyones perception about trucks. Its as perfect as a truck can get.",4
452,"The Fit is one sweeeeeet ride. Comfortable, economical, great shifter, zippy performer, handles well. Even though it is a four-year-old design, it shows why Honda garners so many awards and loyal customers. I have heard it compared to the Chevy (Daewoo) Aveo in looks, but The Fit is a much more integrated design, and the interior is light years ahead of the Koreans. No other small hatchback, urban runabout or wagon comes close to the Fit, except perhaps the Scion xA. It is Storm Silver Metallic, sort of an almost charcoal grey, with black interior. The only major flaw is the lack of a sunroof option. Honda, great job! I will surely take a close look at the next-gen Fit in a few years!",3
453,Looks good and feels good. The bells and whistles could be better quality. Not enough power. Transmission seems to have problems finding gears. My check engine light has come on 3 times. Most frustrating is the car leaks when it rains! the car is now rusting inside from it. the car has been in for service 3 times and they still have not fixed it right.,1
454,"So far we have had this car for about 4 months. My wife absolutely loves her car, she feels it is easy to drive and the most comfortable we have ever owned. I like the sporty feel (when she lets me drive it), and it never lacks for power. If you are looking for a new family car check out the new Passat, you will not be disappointed.",4
455,"Bought this vehicle while I was in Iraq through military buying program. Did research on these types of sites, and information was overwhelmingly positive, even though it was not rated well in Consumer Report. I took a bit of a ""plunge"" and bought it strictly on consumer ratings, vehicle magazine ratings (other than CR), and people such as you giving honest feedback on these sites. Got a great deal and bought a Sport 4x4, CVT transmission, electronic package. I have been driving it for a month now and it exceeds my expectations! I was concerned about a 4-cylinder engine, but more than enough power to get around. I heard some cons about the CVT, but not an issue...works very well.",4
456,"I bought this vehicle for my wife, however I have a hard time passing it on to my vehicle. I think if this was around when I bought my vehicle I would have bought it instead. My wife loves it also. I know we will be traveling in her vehicle more now. By the way we exchanged a Lincoln Navigator for it, and it rides better than the Navigator. It gives my Mercedes a run for the money.",3
457,"I tinkered around with moving to a car from a SUV for several years. I began looking at Infiniti's, Lexus's, BMW's, and even Porsche's. The main draw of the E350 was the 4Matic feature. I am a work-aholic and don't like to miss work due to weather. After I found one at a local dealer, I took it out for a spin. Oh my, was it impressive. I loved the looks. I loved the power. I loved the comfort and fit. It was smooth and powerful. The seats are very supportive. The tranny is smooth and agile and the ride is perfection! After only months of ownership I am convinced I made a great choice. I haven't had it serviced yet which makes me a bit nervous. However, I expect a great experience!",4
458,"The ride is very smooth and quiet. For the price I paid I am very happy, I really like this little truck.",3
459,"Our 2007 V6, 6-speed automatic transmission AWD SEL Fusion is a fantastic car EXCEPT for the horrific in-city gas mileage, a pitiful 13 mpg after 1,800 miles. Our terrain is flat as a fritter. The climate is mild (56 degrees on Feb. 27) and we are both conservative, gentle drivers. The car did, however achieve 26.5 mpg (going) and 24.2 mpg (returning) on a recent 360-mile trip. It's the in-city, stop-and-go travel, 95 percent of our driving, that is the killer. I find it incomprehensible that a 3,300-pound, mid-size car would have such terrible in-city mileage in the year 2007. We enjoy everything else about the car. Ford has a winner here. But the mileage situation needs to be addressed",2
460,"5,000 miles in approx. 1 month. 6 cylinder, auto, no frills, manual windows, vinyl floors, seats. Roomy, added Work Rack and boxes. Felt engine lacked power, downshifted too often on inclines. Added K&N air filter. Big improvement. Better mileage, too. Good truck. Comfortable.",3
461,"I bought this XD with the auto trans, that was the first mistake. This thing scares the heck our of me while trying to merge into 70 mph traffic. Road noise is excessive and the ride is rather bumpy. The brakes are adequate but spongy. Highway mpg is not too bad at 38 but local driving is a dismal 23 mpg. Rear passenger space is surprisingly adequate for average sized people. Rear storage space is small but this a sub compact and is to be expected. The hubcaps had to go. I bought 7 spoke wheels that look much better.",1
462,"We just purchased our Outback Sport hatchback in silver last week. We already have 640 miles from taking rides while being amazed at the gas mileage. Sticker indicates 20/27 city/hwy. We are getting 24-25 city and 33 on the highway. I am 6'4"" and feel very comfortable in this car. We bought this car to replace our Mini Cooper and couldn't be happier. It is extremely sporty, rides very nice, handles excellent, has plenty of power, plenty of cargo and passenger capacity, and did I say sporty? This car is the only small car to receive the rigid IIHS (Insurance Institute of Highway Safety) top 2008 pick safety rating. The Subaru Outback Sport is truly the ""hidden gem"" of small cars.",4
463,"Perfectly fine vehicle to get from point A to point B. The ride was fairly smooth compared to other cars in the segment. I like the brisk acceleration. The doors had a good solid feel. This is the first car to get me car sick as a drive as the car rolled around in fast turns. I only averaged 28 mpg on the highway with the Sentra. This was probably due to the ride height, springy gas pedal and CVT config. Nissan still needs to improve their build quality. Plastic looked like they came out of a generic brand toy. Bottom line, you can get better driving dynamics, build quality, fuel economy or value with a Corolla, Civic or a Mazda3.",1
464,Nice ride and drive. Not as strong as expected. Interior is first class for a truck and by far the best looking truck. 6.4L is not as strong as I thought it would be and transmission stinks. Mine has allready been at the dealership for a transmission reprogram. Fuel economy is awful.,2
465,"This is my first Honda. I have had the car for 4 weeks and I am very impressed with the quality that Honda delivers at this price point. The car is quick and nimble with the 5-Speed manual transmission. Also lots of fun to drive. I bought this car for the excellent gas millage and I am getting around 33 MPG in combination of highway (with traffic) and around town. This car has lots of room. I am 6' 2"" and there is plenty of headroom and ample legroom. No complaints from the back seat either. The Honda engineers really maximize the interior space for such a small car. The seats fold in many different configuations to accomadate various cargo.",4
466,"This car is everything I want. I am a mother of three very busy children and this car fits all our needs. I wanted the luxury componets, since I am in it so much , but it has such family friedly features everyone loves it! Drives nice. All the extras in this car make all the difference. I feel safe in it with my kids. The interior styling is great, but I also think it has a stylish exterior too! Better than Lexus or Mazada.",4
467,Exceptional upscale SUV. Handles like a fine car but has all the advantages of an SUV. Just purchased this SUV in late October but it has been a dream to drive. Interior has many improvements over previous years. Higher quality materials used. Also larger engine but with better mileage.,4
468,"Great car, smooth and comfortable ride. Great mileage - have driven ~5200 miles and have gotten ~22mpg in city and ~30.5 mpg on a 475 mile trip from NC to KY via the Virginia/WV mountains. Worth every penny (since I got it for a discount buying a new 2008 as the 2009 models were coming in).",4
469,"This is my 3rd 3-series (2002 325i, 2006 325i, now my 2008 328i Coupe) and I can say that I have been a loyal, dedicated customer of BMW. The cars are so wonderful once you buy one you can't buy or drive any other make. It feels like a part of you physically as you drive the car, from the structure to the brakes to the steering and engine the feeling is so terrific and reassuring other makes feel like appliances in comparison or clouds to drive (i.e. Lexus). BMW sure has created a car worthy of master craftsmanship that will have longevity in the marketplace for years to come if they keep up the wonderful effort in producing such a wonderful product!",4
470,"I bought a cts-v in 2005, and I thought that car was a blast to drive. The 2008 cts, 3.6 d.i., all wheel drive, handles as good, and ride quality is superior to the V. I have to admit, that I love this new cts better than the cts-v. interior is comfortable, the exterior is beautiful! I am in love with my cts!",4
471,Whith the rising cost of gas and the lack of needing two SUVs. The Scion tC was the perfect vehicle for my daily commuter needs even with all four of my children.,4
472,"This is a fun car to drive! I was concerned about the size of the vehicle because I have kids. They fit comfortably. The car has great power and excellent gas mileage. I used to drive a Yukon Denali and was disappointed with the handling. For much less, I got a smoother ride, fun car and great gas mileage.",4
473,"We just returned from a five day trip in our new Ford Explorer Limited. We are very happy with it except for the loud engine noise that it makes when you barely put on the gas to pass, going up an incline or just taking off. We gotta get something done about this problem. I have purchased a stream of Exploerers and this has to be by far the loudist of all which makes me think there is something wrong in the manifold/exaust area connections or that there is far too little insullation on the rear fire wall.",3
474,"I purchased my 2008 STI in March of 2008 and have been completely satisfied. It is fast, useful and the 2008 avoided the ""boy racer"" wing of older STIs. Some say the car has gotten soft - as compared to what? If a far better car and as fast as my 2004 Mustang Cobra and a powerful car with all wheel drive is simply amazing. The dealers are now discounting the STI heavily - my advice is if you want performance and durability - test drive the new STI - and gas mileage is 20-22 if you exercise some control. The STI is hands down the best performance car I have ever owned",4
475,"I have driven many ""luxury"" vehicles, including lexus and mercedes, nothing compares to this car. This is, by leaps and bounds, the best purchase I ever made. This is a GREAT car!",4
476,"At first I was hesitant about buying such a small car, but I saw the crash test ratings online before buying the Smart, and I signed up to buy it. It gets great gas mileage, plus you can garantee that as soon as you pull out of your driveway, your car will get attention. It is fun to drive and it looks sporty.",4
477,This is a great car-nimble and fun to drive. Have it for 3 months and so far I have encountered no problems. I really like its keyless feature-you don't need to insert key to start the engine (like an expenssive car). It's highly recomended.,4
478,"Second Passat, previous one was a 2000. This car is head and shoulders better, with improved styling, performance, and safety features. I love it! Can't beat the price for a near-luxury European sedan.",4
479,"I just picked up my 2007 G35 Sport Sedan (Auto) last weekend and have been loving it since I drove it off the lot. The other cars that I evaluated in my purchasing process were the Lexus IS350, Audi 3.2 A4, and the BMW 335. The G holds it own with all and surpasses them in many ways, most notably price, performance, and driving experience. Considering that each of the aforementioned models are at least 3k more in price I don?t see how one could justify such a premium. Interior and exterior styling is truly outstanding and the sport model is flat out ?tight?. An outstanding automobile!",4
480,"I purchased the SX4 in December of 07. Being my first new car it has been the best compared to my 91 Lincoln Mark 7 and my 95 Mazda 626. It feels like you're doing laps around a go-cart track. It's always eager to downshift wich makes it hit that right note at all times. My mom even wanted to borrow it and she has a 07 BMW 3 series. She loved it until she crashed it. Wasn't anything major but the front bumper, radiator, grill and headlight needed replcing and she still rides the same if not better then the day I got her. It's funny how the first accident my mom's ever gotten in. It had to be my brand new SX4 but you wouldn't even notice the dealership did an excelent job, another great thing about SX4",4
481,"What a trill to drive. The Nypnotic Teal Mica gets many stares, particularly with the black and polished aluminum wheels that I added immediately. I travel frequently for long distances, so having cruise control is a ticket saver. I discovered that you can be doing 80 mhp and not realize it. One of the main reasons for my decision to purchase the 08 xB was the ability to make it a very personal vehicle, its hard to beat the value for your dollar ratio. Shape, weight and power were my second reasons.",3
482,"I have been debating for some time now on trading my 2003 G35 coupe and 1997 Chevy S-10 in. We wanted to consolodate vehicles. So, my wife suggested we start looking around. It was hard parting from my G35, and I was not sure that the Escape would be a good replacement (as flashy or fun). The vehicle that we purchased was a 2008 Limited 4WD that was pratically loaded. My wife sat in the front seat and was love at first site. Once I started driving it around town I fell in love as well and forgot all about my G.......(what).",3
483,"This is an exceptional little car. Nimble, smooth, comfortable and quiet. Peppy at city speeds and adequate on the freeway. Engine noise typical for the class, but road and wind noise are hushed. Front seats very comfortable, though steering wheel a bit too far from driver. Large trunk. Adequate leg room in back seat for a 6-footer. Center gauges not a problem. Stylish interior. We liked the Honda Fit, but thunderous road noise and slow acceleration were deal breakers. Yaris somehow felt more solid and substantial. Professional car reviewers are enthusiasts and write reviews from that perspective. We found many of their complaints to be exaggerated or bogus. Give this car a test drive.",4
484,"Just got it, but is incredibly fun to drive, and the price is right. Where else can you get a fully loaded ""sport"" model at this price point. Only thing is in this area, their is about an eight week waiting list to purchase one. I had to travel an hour and an half round trip to pick one up.",4
485,"I've had my Nitro for net yet a week. So far, I love it. I'm getting good gas mileage, 18 city and 23-24 hwy. I love the kick from the 4.0L engine. Great bold styling! I get a lot of comments and questions. It's great! The R/T comes with the bigger tires and nice wheels, a nice extra.",4
486,"Had my TCH for about 2 months now and have to say I am very satisfied. I am averaging 38 mpg local, and 40+ on highway. Great idea of killing two birds with one stone, saving money on gas and being eco friendly.",4
487,Very happy with the style and performance of the new G. Best value in its class. Handling is unbelievable as is the acceleration. A great buy when considering the competition!!,4
488,"I had all the Vettes c 1-5 and and this one will make history. If you drive one you will buy one. A little hi tech for an everyday driver, but so far no problems.",4
489,"This is an awesome little car, that's fun to drive. It has some pep to it. It has good cargo space and can haul 2 6' tall guys in the backseat comfortably.",3
490,"Having owned an impressive list of performance cars I was not expecting much from the Fit in terms of performance but I was badly mistaken. This car is a blast. With a few aftermarket upgrades I made(suspension springs and lighter wheels) this car handles as well if not better than a Mini. The lack of horsepower is just not missed when you have such a wonderful chassis to play with. Gas mileage has been 38mpg on average. Build quality is excellent. Paint is good. No rattles to be heard. If you are a car enthusiast forced to ""downgrade"" for a while, this car is no downgrade!",4
491,"I am loving this car, and so do all the heads that keep turning when I ride by. I have the 2008 C300 Sport w/automatic & panoramic roof, black on black w/the aluminum interior trim. I always frowned upon black interiors but this car is stunning. I always owned front wheel drive cars in the past, Nissan Maxima & Murano, the feel of the acceleration is phenomenal, a nice mix of luxury and sport. I was amazed at how solid & sure the car drives in the rain, makes you want to push the envelope. I was leery transitioning to a car from a SUV but I don't miss it one bit. I thought the interior would feel cramped, but it feels quite comfortable & spacious, and I'm a healthy kinda guy",4
492,"Bought this car for my wife. After looking at mom mobiles this one stood out as a much cooler ride that fit our needs of towing capacity, safety, and styling. She like that it was not too big and I like that it doesn't look like a space ship. The ride is much better than previous jeeps on the road and road noise is almost nil. The back seats have plenty of room and the roof rack is great for overflow luggage. Also discovered recently that the back seats recline which is a huge benefit since most SUVs this size make you feel like you are sitting in a church pew.",3
493,Very nice vehicle. Came out of audi s4. Not the v8 beast but fun and easy to drive fast and smooth. Great road feel and lighter car to drive. More of a generic look but I wanted something more low key. Great value for the money. Did a 24 mo lease to see if i like it.,3
494,"If you're shopping for a small SUV or a wagon type of vehicle, this is the practical choice. It's highly rated on most significant categories, not to mention competitively priced, considering Hondas are known to be a little more pricey than its rivals.",3
495,"I think it was a big mistake for GM to do away with the Grand Prix. I love mine. I test drove a new G8, and was not impressed at all. The 2008 Grand Prix got a bad rap when they underrated it as just another carry over car that was ready to be put out to pasture,so to speak. I will drive this one with pride, and hope GM brings it back in a few years like the Camaro.",4
496,"I did my research, and discounted the Fit, Yaris etc in favour of the Versa bc of horsepower, room and the Nissan reputation. It exceeded all my expectations at first - fun to drive, reliable, good fuel economy, easy to handle. Then winter hit. In cold, wet weather, I would come out to the car and find ice all over the dash, controls and inside of the windows and windshields. The controls wouldn't work and the doors wouldn't shut. Warming it up - no change. Getting it fixed at the dealer proved extremely problematic ie. didn't happen - cost to me to fix was quoted at $5-10K. I just traded it in for a 2009 model - hoping for better this time around. It'll likely be my last Nissan too.",1
497,My last vehicles where Toyotas and a Chevy Suburban. My Toyota is still going strong but my Suburban is falling apart. I told my wife I'll never buy American but when she told me about the Enclave I went myself and test drove the car. Amazing look and comfort so I purchased one that same day and surprised my wife. Everywhere we go we get stopped and they ask what kind a car this is.,4
498,"So far so good, This is my second Eclipse Spyder from Mitsubishi. It has a nice appearance. I get compliments from all who see it, even strangers in parking lots. Hopefully the interior will hold up better then the '01 model. I wasn't going to buy anoher one, I waited over a year for the new Pontiac G6 convertible...what a disappointment. I left the Pontiac dealer and drove back to Mitsubishi. I went down to a 4-cyl. from the V6 I was used to driving, but the power was great. The V6 felt great. This car does not have a lot of people room, but it has plenty of shopping room. It has very sensitive controls. I am glad they got rid of the Infinity sound system. Overall I give this car a 9.5.",4
499,"Excellent performance, comfortable long driving experience, sophistication not seen in any other trucks. The only thing I didn't get was the entertainment system.",4
500,"Bought the Avalanche to replace my Silverado. Couldn't be happier except I can't get my wife out of the Avalanche! Got the White Diamond package with 22"" wheels. Took it to the car wash last week and when finished the young man asked for the owner and another customer said he wished it was his. Two of the young men wiping it down mentioned what a ""sweet ride"" I had. Drove from Utah to Texas and back fully loaded and averaged over 20 mpg at over 70 mph. Extremely comfortable ride on the open road! The folding steps are great! I'm over 6' tall and my wife is 5'; the adjustable pedals and memory seats make the truck a joy for both. Almost a year and a half and no visits to the shop.",4
501,"This car is so roomy and comfortable.My 6'4"" nephew has plenty leg and headroom in the third row seating! The design is sleek and beautiful.We have the Cocoa metallic color. The car gets head turning stares and lots of comments from other drivers. We have driven in the mountains and it has great pickup on long climbs. Absolutely love the ability to manually shift from 1st to 6th gears. Fold down seats make lots of cargo space. Remote opening of the lift gate helps when you have large loads. It is so quiet thanks to Thinsulate insulation. The mirrors are large,easily adjustable. 12 cup holders means no spills. Numerous airbags make me feel safer,esp with kids in tow. We love the sound system. Great car!",4
502,"My first new car since my 98 Grand Caravan. This car impressed me right from the test drive. The reviews mention a slow response of the CVT. Hogwash,the 2.0L w/CVT moves like a jack rabbit. My previous Mopars had lousy headlights, backup lights, and brakes. All are improved on this car. I can finally see the road on a rainy night. The SXT model is nicely equipped. Great car to take back and forth to work everyday. Very comfortable.",4
503,"This is my 3rd x5. The other 2 had the 4.4 engine and this has the 4.8. I love this truck. We also have the BMW 645 convertable. My husband and I like the x5 better. It is fast, handles like a sports car, never been in the shop for any repairs. It is alot of fun to drive. It has all the bells and whistles and is great on long trips. very comfortable for everyone. I even like the looks. I plan on getting another one when the lease is over or maybe I'll get the x 6. I recomend it to everyone. It sucks gas like most SUVs.",4
504,The Bullitt Package on the 2008 Mustang makes the car a road racing machine right from the factory. The upgrades transform the car into a fun to drive and great looking machine.,4
505,"The Wolfsburg Edition Jetta 2.0T is a much more grown-up feeling Jetta. I'm a diehard VW driver. My first VW was a 1987 Fox which I had for 9 years. I just traded in my '99 Passat GLX for this new Jetta and although I miss the interior size and weight of the Passat, the Jetta has come along way from feeling like your kid sister's car. Much roomier interior and cargo. Back seats have dual climate control, armrest with cup holders, and plenty of legroom for two full-size adults. Thw Wolfsburg comes with everything you'd need: 6-CD in-dash, MP3 adapter, power moonroof, sporty wheels.",3
506,"Coming from an '06 330i. This car is feels like it's built like a tank. It has such a heavy feeling my wife feels really secure with. I think it feels too heavy, and a bit too soft, but not like a Lexus at least. You can feel the road below you, just with a filter whereas the BMW lets you feel everything. The engine is quite good, lots of torque in low RPMs. Fuel economy is not as good as a BMW, but respectable. Dealer installed Continental ContiSport3 tires. Wish they used something else -- they are really loud. And the navigation really is terrible -- only can direct you to a number range on any given street. Welcome to the 21st century, Mercedes!!",3
507,"I really love my Versa. I went from an unreliable 1994 Mazda 626 to a 2007 Versa and it was a wise choice and a great buy. My only issue is I have not mastered parking it like I did with my Mazda. Hopefully, I will get better with time. I love my Nissan Versa!!!!",3
508,"Bought a 2008 Fusion in May and have put approximately 2,200 miles on it. Bottom line; it's fun to drive, looks great, has a lot of room for stuff, and gets solid combined gas mileage (around 24 mpg for the V6). I can't argue at all. And for all the features, it still cost the same as or less than most of the other comparable mid-size sedans. If the quality holds up, it should be a great car for the next couple of years.",3
509,"I recently purchased this truck almost a month ago for an excellent low price! The 4 cyl exceeded my expectations! The truck has plenty of power, handles great, road noise is lower than I expected and interior and exterior is sharp looking. Gas mileage is great! I wish the speakers sounder better, but hey, it's a truck! It also feels great to buy American!",4
510,I bought the 4Runner after looking at a LOT of other vehicles and the 4Runner was the best choice. Nothing beats Toyota's build quality and that can be seen with the 4Runner. You still see '84 4Runners on the road! Ride quality is excellent and the drive is smooth. Interior design is great too.,4
511,"For about six months, I researched the TCH and finally purchased it in December. I love driving this car. I am consistently averaging between 38-40 mpg both city/highway. The power and acceleration are adequate and I'm saying this coming from a six cylinder Nissan Maxima. The interior is great, despite the plastic everywhere and the exterior...well, the few times that I had to go to the gas station (and other places) I always get great comments about the look. TCH...I'm lovin' it! If you are wondering if you should buy this car, wonder no more. If I based my selection on the test drive, I probably would have missed out, but now that I own it, it's a dream to drive",4
512,"This is the best car I ever bought. Everything about this ride rocks. There is so much space inside. Everyone should buy one. The interior is incredible. The outside is stylish. The gas mileage is incredible. What's not to like. Well, I guess the 109 hp engine is the only down side... but, that equals the rocking gas mileage. Buy one... you won't regret it.",4
513,"I love love love my Mazda 3. I did a lot of research of the Honda Civic, Fit, Toyota Corolla and the Volks Jetta. I was almost going to buy the Corolla until I test drove the Mazda 3 Sedan. It was the handling that sold me and the expensive/sporty look of the trim. The Corolla was everything I expected it to be, but the Mazda 3 surpassed what I was looking for.",4
514,"Bought this 10 months ago and am looking to trade it in even though I know I will take a loss. has tons of cargo space and leg room, but the motor works too hard. Doesn't feel like it shifts properly. Not very darty--takes a long time to accelerate. Gas mileage for me has been consistently at 18 miles and less. I have never gotten even 19 mile per gallon as stated. 14 gallon tank is small--feels like I am always at the gas station. radio and amenities are positioned well for a comfy ride. Great heat and A?C but is hard to hear radio over it--not strong speakers",1
515,"I originally went to the dealership to buy an EX model with the navigation option but as soon as I saw the Si, I had to drive it. I got reeled in by the sound of the exhaust which is mellow but strong and not ""boy racerish"". The 6 speed is silky smooth. The car is not fast by any stretch of the imagination. I have had cars that made 350hp with plenty of torque and this isn?t one of them. I was never under the assumption that I was buying anything more than a Civic to use as my primary work vehicle. It is a nice, sporty looking, decent performing compact sedan but you don't notice the performance until you get above 6000 rpms. That is where the little 2.0L really shines.",3
516,"We had a 2000 Tundra that did a wonderful job for us. We moved and when it was time for a new one, the Titan pulled more weight so we got one. While the Titan was a wonderful truck, it's just not a Toyota. This new Tundra is just plain gorgeous and I anticipate performance and comfort on our cross-country journeys while pulling a trailer.",4
517,"I have owned 2 other Pontiacs. My 07 is the best car that I have driven. Plenty of horses, sporty but luxury at the same time. I sell cars for a living at a dealer and when ever we get them used I try to get people to buy this car. I believe they are worth every penny!",4
518,This corvette has been a nightmare. The first thing was the top creaks when hot and has been to the shop 4 times and still not fixed. Both front sway bar links had to be replaced and the entire rack and pinion. The drivers bottom seat panel has to be replaced and the battery has been replaced. The problems just keep mounting and for a car that costs this much I would have expected better quality.,0
519,"I owned a 2005 Chevy Trailblazer LT, loaded to the max. Sunroof,dual zone auto climate. Everything but the kitchen sink was in this truck. I loved driving it but the gas was killing me and the lease was up. I own a 08 Elantra and I'm happy with it so I figured I would check out the Sante Fe. Fit and finish is good but I don't think the ride is so smooth. When I'm doing 60mph and up I can feel it. On my trailblazer when I was doing 60 it felt like I was going 30mph Gas Mileage is between 18 and 19mpg and this is mostly all highway, so I am not to impressed with the mpg. Santa Fe is basically for the wifey and she likes it but my next truck will be a GM if they're around:)",3
520,"Had a 2006 Avalon and was hit head on by a pickup truck. Survived because of the air bags, seat belts and the front crush panels engineered into the car. Replaced the Avalon with a new 2007 Avalon. Shifts smoother, rides like a dream, and has even better milage than the 2006. I get 30/31 mpg on the road and 23/24 in town and for a full sized sedan that is amazing.",4
521,"The car runs great, handles well, nice and roomy. There is a squeaking noise going over bumps that sounds like it hasn't been lubed. I like it very much. It's versatle and fun to drive. Makes you want to get in it and go cruising except I can't because the headlights randomly flicker. This ranges from mild to severe with severe being when the dash lights flicker too and then they both blip out and then back on again. I've had it to two different dealers who can't find a thing wrong wth it so I guess it must be posessed. I wouldn't buy another one of these. I hope someone can finally fix it so I can enjoy it without worry.",2
522,Well this is my very first SUV and my very first brand new vehicle. I had a 2004 Mazda3 and a 1999 Dodge Avenger before this Jeep. I haven't had it long but I absolutely LOVE it. We looked at several different SUV's before purchasing this one and we were definitely happy with this purchase when we drove it home. I have always loved Jeeps and I was definitely happy to finally own one. It doesn't even hesitate to go through the snow we have and I feel so much safer in it. My dad did own the old body style of the Liberty and I definitely love the changes they have made!,4
523,"After owning my Dodge Avenger R/T AWD for only 1076 miles (no payments made yet!) my transmission has begun shifting way to early causing a tranny chatter. For example between 40 and 50 miles an hour the transmission has already shifted into 6th gear. Grrr. Instead of down-shifting the tranny ""chatters"" and shakes. I truly love the car and hope the dealership can repair it quickly without problems. Waited my whole life to buy ""new"" and it's going into the shop before the first payment is due!",2
524,"One of the nicest and fun to drive car i drove in my whole life. I cant describe my feelings, the interior is awesome the dashboard the seats every thing every thing in this beauty is wonderful. by by Lexus. it is time to welcome the king of luxury from Japan (Infiniti).",4
525,"As a Yukon owner for 6 years, the 2007 Yukon is a striking upgrade. Handling is very solid. Exterior fit and finish are noteworthy. Interior design is intuitive and everything works. I miss the rear ""barn doors"" of my older version. I appreciate the presence of the air bag curtains. All of the luxury items I sought are combined in this large SUV. Prior to the purchase I drove the BMW X5, the Q-ship and my last test drive was a 2007 Yukon. Exiting the 2007 Yukon, the decision was immediate: 2007 Yukon.",4
526,"I luv this car. It's compact and cute - IMHO it's the most eye-catching compact cross-over SUV in the market right now. Before we bought this car, we had test driven Honda CR-V, Subaru 2009 Forrester, RAV-4 and Matrix 2009 AWD. Rogue provides the best balance for what we are looking for in its segment. It's responsive, beautifully designed inside and out. The gas mileage is reasonable. Best of all, you get the best value out of the money you spend. Highly recommended.",4
527,"I absolutely love my 2008 CTS. I chose a 6 speed manual with the direct injection (304 hp) and for the power it gets amazing fuel economy. I have not had one single problem with this car since I drove it off the dealer lot. The cabin is comfortable, quiet and has lots of goodies to play with. Th exterior literally makes heads turn. The materials are high quality and the design is flawless.",4
528,"I have owned a 2005 Maxima, which was totaled early this year and now a 2008 Maxima. This car is really a considerable car to purchase. The comfort and performance stands out in 2008 Maxima. There are too many car buyers down-playing the CVT engine. People have been use to the engine shifting over 50 years of cars. This Maxima with CVT has no shift shock. So it's nice and smooth driving. 0-60 in 6 seconds and I able to pull a track time of 14.8 1/4 mile in 75 degree weather. With my 05 Maxima, I put on 35K miles and had NO problems with the engine. Now with this new 2008 Maxima, I have 5K miles and still no problems. This 08 SL is worth what I spent and I highly recommend it.",4
529,"Love this car! It handles great, provides a smooth ride, very quiet, great gas mileage for teh size, and looks fantastic! A lot of features for an LT model!",4
530,"I was interested in AWD, coming from a Benz SUV, and looked at Audi, Acura, Infinity, Lexus, Mercedes, and Cadillac. The 535xi was simply the best car that I drove. It also was the most expensive of the group that I tested. In fact, like others have said, it is the best car that I have ever driven! The technology is not intrusive, it is helpful and with a little practice and reading the manuals, the navigation system and communication systems are your best friends. The fit and finish of the interior is impressive. The combination of pure driving capability, speed when needed, technology, and creature comforts in the cabin, made me covet the car.",4
531,"I turned in my 2006 Explorer V6 XLT to get a smaller more fuel efficient SUV that was also not so truckish. The Escape V6 AWD was the SUV of choice. I got for a good price one year old used with 17,000 miles. The Explorer I traded in got only an avg. of 12-13 mpg and had a real truck SUV feel to it. The Escape has a much smoother feel to it and gets an avg of 19 mpg.",3
532,"I bought this car in January 2008 and since then all the other cars I drove in my life were nothing. It's an absolutely fantastic car, very quick, the engine noise fantastic ,the steering is like driving a GTi and the build quality fabulous. Of course like every car in the market has its negatives. I have tried hard to find as many as I can but I only find one. Fuel consumption. Well at least you know it before you buy, it even though that Mazda misleads you with the 12.3l per 100km. The best i have managed is 14.5l per 100 km.",3
533,"Due to the excellent lease programs, I decided on the F-150 due to the value of the programs. I came out of a 2003 Taurus that I drove 100K+ miles without an ounce of trouble. Although it took a day or two to get used to the size, this truck has exceeded my expectations in every conceivable way. It's comofortable, it's smooth and handles beautifilly. The gas mileage of course could be better, but the trade off is excellent road manners, room for 5 and extreme comfort. The 4 X 4 is amazing in snow. Not a squeak, rattle or flaw. I love it.",4
534,"I was not planning on purchasing a Vue. After seeing the quality and test driving it, I was very impressed. I didn't care for the gas mileage, but figured it was a trade off for the AWD and power for Maine driving. I opted out of the original Vue with the 4- cylinder engine. Please take the lack of power into consideration when making your final decision. But, true to their word, Saturn took my 4-cyl. back and put me in to a 6 cyl AWD. What a difference in vehicles. Overall, the Vue has been a pleasant vehicle for me to drive. I use this vehicle for business and drive it every day. When you drive past an older Vue, you'll be proud of how far along they've come.",3
535,"Just got the car last week. Traded Porsche Cayenne base model. What a difference! Handling is superb. Very quiet and powerful. Much fun to drive. Superb nav system, easy to use. Bluetooth phone integration is very good and very useful. Have not pushed the car given that it is still being broken in. Pain finish is superb - silver metallic is a great choice. Did not like active steering - seems overly heavy. Glad my car does not have it. Enough road feel as is. car was delivered with two, hopefully, minor defects - driver's side heated seat control does not work and there is rattle around the steering column.",3
536,"I looked around for a car for almost 6months then I found my Accent! The price the payments and the insurance all fit perfect! I'm 20, live on my own and work full time and go to school! So money is tight but I never stop moving. I needed something cheaper, dependable, and good on gas. My little car is perfect! I can park anywhere and I love my XM. Oh and I had it out in the country for the first time the other day and it handle the gravel roads and bumps great.",4
537,"I traded in a sexy Maxima for a minivan and I love it. It is perfect for a family, has loads of room, is very comfortable, has great pick-up.",4
538,"I am going to write this for what it is, one of the least expensive cars on the market. I am really impressed for the price. With the first fill up, got 42 mpg. A/C, AM-FM stereo/CD with MP3 plug in. ABS, 15"" wheels, drives nice, plenty of power to weight. I bought a car that is much quieter then my Ranger XLT, gets better mpg then my RAV4 and is fun to drive. Unlike those who want all kinds of standard features, I am happy that they aren't loaded as I had a lot more choice in the price. I understand that I didn't buy a Lexus, I bought an economy car and am very happy with it. I look forward to years of Yaris miles.",3
539,"Great vehicle. Researched Ford Escape and all other small SUV's and the Patriot is the best value even if gas goes up to $5 a gallon. No need for you to repeat my research. Been getting about 21.5 mpg on the first tank mostly city driving though. Sharp vehicle, with really great handling, I can get it into tight spaces. Have your cake and eat it to with this SUV. Can't wait to see how it will perform in the snow.",4
540,Purchased the M35 with the technology package in July (08). For the most part it is a lovely car but it seems like it is missing some comfort items. It swallows gasoline instead sipping on it. The ride is nice and quiet and it has PLENTY of room inside and a ton of style outside.,3
541,This has got to be the best Honda that we've ever owned. The mileage is fantastic for an SUV-type vehicle and the space is great. The mileage compares to our old Honda Accord. Our new CRV is fun to drive and we love taking it out on the highway where it gives us about 32 mpg. We average about 25 mpg in town. Can't say enough about the great gas mileage and the fun it is to drive. Best economical car we've ever owned. Like it almost as much as our Mercedes 560SL ... almost.,4
542,This car keeps me laughing at all who spend a lot more on the luxury models as well as those whom have to use premium fuel. The Avalon has a limo like back seat which makes taking guest out with you a very flattering event as well as the pleasure and comfort of the ride. I use this car for both long business trips (300 mi+) and local. The mileage has been good for a bigger six (24 mpg avg). The ability for this car to get up and go is amazing. The manual shift mode is exciting with almost 300 ponies under the hood but yet refined enough for the wifes finest dress and black tie night out.,4
543,When driving the Yaris you feel like an ice skater gliding over the ice. I have only had the car for 4 days but I know it's the best purchase I've ever made. The gas mileage is awesome as a commuter this will come in handy!!!,4
544,"I finally own my dream vehicle. This RDX is beautiful. I picked the carbon bronze because not too many vehicles on the road are that color. The AWD is superb for handling in any situation. The turbocharged engine is very good for performance in passing and acceleration, better than some V6s. The interior is very comfortable with the adjustable driver seat and roomy enough second row. The satellite radio, 360-watt stereo system, dual climate, digital read-outs, and memory seats are all awesome for standard equipment. The fuel economy is respectable and premium gas is not a problem. This crossover is a 10 all the way around. Thanks Acura for another innovative, top-of-the-line vehicle.",4
545,"Great car. I bought it for the reputation, safety rating and gas mileage. Pros: drove from Los Angeles to Dallas and got 36 hwy and up to 46 when not using the A/C, very ?zippy? and fun to drive. Huge windshield allowing passenger to prop feet up on dash, adequate room inside and trunk. Cons: sometimes acts like it wants to stall when idling. Front brakes replaced at 22,000 miles (not covered by warranty). I was told this was due to driving in LA traffic which I believe; CD player died so entire audio system replaced 8 months after purchase (covered by warranty) and lots of road noise. Locked keys in car due to automatic locking system - very annoying!",3
546,"Have never really been a fan of Mercedes Benz, too boxy looking. Thought it was like driving a good truck. Must say this new 2007 E350 is awesome. I love the new redesign. Finally Mercedes is on the right track. Drives like a dream and really hugs the road and with the sports package. It has nothing to envy compared to the BMW. I just upgraded from my Lexus 430 smooth ride, but the Mercedes is a lot more fun to drive. Especially impressed with the 268hp V-6. Excellent pick up and go!",4
547,"I am very disappointed with the engine & automatic transmission design. There is a very bad dead zone in the acceleration in 1st from a dead stop. The top squeals when coming up. The maintenance is free but when they don't fix anything it's worthless. The repair shop isn't familiar with the car and can't fix problems. I have had to go back 4 or 5 times before something gets fixed. They have even lied, actually fixed something and said on the repair sheet that there was nothing was wrong. I would not recommend anyone buy this Car with an automatic. The rear view is cluttered and very dangerous to back up. The automation in the controls is stupid, mostly unnecessary and very annoying",0
548,"This is my first jeep. I bought it because of price and fuel economy. We had a snowy winter, and it handles well in snow. I have a toddler, so the plastic back on the seats and the YES fabric work great. Controls are in odd spots, and that took some getting used to. Window noise from rear windows is annoying. Seats are uncomfortable, and the arm rest is terrible, cup holders very inconvenient. For the second time in a month, the power windows have failed. All four windows get stuck down, the controls get some working after repeated effort. Rear driver never responded, stuck down. In zero degree weather with a toddler, a real problem. Today it did it again- thinking of trading...",1
549,"Another great car! The 2008 may be the last in this series, so I had to buy before they change it into a cross-over! I drive a lot of interstate miles, and feel safe with higher assurance of returning if hit. Sort of a small tank. No fear of muddy country roads with the great 4wd. Did have to give up a power plug for the MP3 plug-in (bummer)!The 08 has added XM radio and does offer some good entertainment while on trips. Almost same as 05, slight loss of build quality. Noticeable looseness in rear torque conversion around 35 mph or so, not in 05. Maybe it will go away with time. Still could not get side airbag option, must be a myth, like GPS. Not an economy car. Feels secure on the road.",3
550,"Don't buy. Unfindable can't-fix-it interior rattles & bumps and rough highway pavement. Balky starts from standstill - drivers new to car stall in traffic again and again. Seatbelt alarm makes punishing howl six times if one doesn't buckle up before starting car, so one must first open door with key, put down key down, buckle up, then pick up key and start car. Forget to do it and get punished by ugly noise. There is no sound insulation at all - hear every noise in wheel wells. Seat back mechanism to enter rear does not go back to position so seat backs must be readjusted each time. NO LUMBAR SUPPORT. Less than average directional stability. This car stinks.",0
551,I chose this car because dealers were gouging on the Prius. I have been very pleasantly surprised. My mileage has been 48 highway and 43 city-- better than expected. Road noise and stereo have not been issues and both are superior when compared to my 2005 Escape Hybrid -- and the Civic is a lot more fun to drive. I highly recommend this vehicle.,4
552,"When I first got behind the wheel, the truck seemed enormous. Almost too big if you can believe that. But after a few miles of driving, I quickly fell in love with everything in the truck. It has everything and more a driver could want. You can haul groceries, building supplies, kids, kids friends, tow the boat, camper etc. and on and on and on. There is almost no limit with this truck. It also handles and rides really really good.",4
553,"Have this car in Silver without a wing. The wingless lancer looks classy especially in silver. Added limo tints to the back half of the car. This adds amazing privacy for that luxuriously large back seat area (if ya know what I mean). Also if you take time to notice, the fabric used for the seats is perfect and very cleanable (much better than leather would be). I couldn't ask for sportier gauges. Thanks Mitsubishi. If 152 HP isn't enough, slap an intake an exhaust on it, you'll pass TCs, Civics and Mazda 3s. I must say when driving this car, I feel very in control of it. Many other cars don't compare. I adore my cars spacious interior so much. It's not just a car. It's an adventure. Thanks Mitsubishi.",4
554,"I LOVE this car! We researched new cars for about 5 months before deciding on this one. The interior has more room than the 4runner and yet still has bigger tires and gets better gas mileage. Plus, the third row is standard and folds flat, the 4runner isn't a standard 7-passenger and the seats don't fold flat. The layout of the interior is superior to the pilot and every other car we had test riden. It just by far is the best reliable car that can be sporty, but yet still fit the whole family in. We are a family of 5, and fit very comfortably. I just love driving it!",4
555,"I bought this car after many months considering the various options. I can truly say that for the money it has been a very good car. It serves its purpose very well for a couple. However, a family will find it tight to fit. My wife and I absolutely love this car. We have done 2 long trips with it and have been very pleased with the gas mileage, it has been exactly as described. It is my first Jeep and all I have to say is ""Well Done Jeep"".",3
556,"Overall we have found the van acceptable. Having traded a Pontiac ssei sedan for the van beacuse of medical reasons we've found many of the amenities of the sedan lacking in the van and not available as an option. However, for the task of carrying medical equipment it is acceptable. The large amount of room is pleasing. Gas mileage isn't great, especially for a 250 hp engine. The sedan got 19 mpg in town, 23 mpg on the highway and was a 3.8l, turbocharged 276 hp engine.",2
557,"I bought this car as a replacement to a 1993 Audi. I drive a lot and needed good fuel economy. I have almost 5000 miles on the car and my calculated mpg is 37.4. The headrests are uncomfortable from the factory (they tip my head forward), but they are easily reversed and quite comfortable when reversed. It is a little tight with 2 teenage boys in the back, but they can make it work. It handles well. It has good acceleration and cornering. I was a little afraid of the low rolling resistance tires, but they seem to perform well. The stereo is adequate, but lacks fidelity in the bass. I suggest the XFE version over the standard. Its performance seems about the same. Minor lines mismatch on hood",3
558,"So far I have not experienced any of the transmission issues that others are talking about. I have nothing but good things to say about this vehicle. I have custom 2 tone leather seats in it and they are fantastic. Have no issues with any of the instruments or controls. I'm averaging about 16.8 mpg (only 400 miles on the vehicle and nothing but city driving, no hwy miles really). The torque and hp is a LITTLE low but all that does is teach me to accelerate without a sense of being in a race all the time. That saves gas anyway so I think it's fine. At speed I have no problem getting in and out of traffic. By the way my previous vehicle was a VW Jetta VR6 and this gets better mpg.",3
559,"Comfortable, in control feeling all of the time. Hardly any lean in the corners seems bigger than it actually is.",3
560,Love the AWD. The varable transmission took some getting used to. Really like how it handles,4
561,"I have put about 1600 miles on the car so far and love it. There are a few minor things to quible about, but overall this car is an absolute blast to drive. Faster then a stock M3 and a lot more comfortable.",3
562,"We had a 2006 325i which we traded for the 528i. The 3 series is a fun car to drive but the 5 series is truly a luxury automobile. The ride, comfort, workmanship & engineering is outstanding. My wife & I were somewhat apprehensive about the iDrive, but we both actually like it & it is not that difficult to use. This is our second BMW & would recommend the BMW brand to anyone looking for luxury.",4
563,"This Enclave is the 27th vehicle I have owned, the great majority being GM brands. I had about given up on GM for my next vehicle until I saw the Enclave at the Phoenix Auto Show. I purchased one two weeks later and love it. The quality is exceptional and the styling and performance leave nothing to be desired.",4
564,"The Dodge Challenger SRT8 is one of the sexiest new models on the market right now. It had an immediate impact from the time it was unveiled as a concept car in 2006 and continues to be one of the most anticipated cars of the year. Dodge needs to capitalize on the endless opportunities with this model and set the pace for reinventing the modern American muscle car. Dodge should play off two versions of this car. Have one ""Big Baller"" V8 model with an MSRP of just under $40,000 and a more affordable ""Economized"" version with a V6 at around $25,000. Dodge can capitalize on the SRT8 if they realize the popular demand for this car...",4
565,"I've had my Liberty Sport now for about 3 months. I was first drawn to its rugged good looks and 4x4 reputation. I have to say it the interior is extremely comfortable and the seats are very supportive. Acceleration from a stop is very good, but highway passing... forget it. The V6 feels so sluggish that you have to jam your foot on the gas pedal to get the transmission to downshift into 3rd gear. Everything on this Jeep is great, but they should have revamped the engine and transmission instead of using the version from the old Liberty.",3
566,"I drove several different vehicles including the tiny Fit and a luxurious CRV, but as soon as I got into the Element I knew it was the right one. The kiwi-metallic color puts a smile on my face every time I see it and it is so much fun to drive. The factory stereo BUMPS! Accelerates well enough... I don't drive too aggressively... kid seat fits with tons of room left over. I wish the rear windows rolled down. They pop open but that can be a hassle while driving. The seats are fairly comfortable. A little stiff but that helps a bad back on a long drive... good support. TONS of interior room. Feels like a real sturdy vehicle. Drove WAY better than the Pilot. Never loved a car like I love my Element!!",4
567,"I just picked it up last night, but it has been nothing but fun since then. This is my second SI, the first being a 1990 model when I was younger. I never owned a vehicle since then that had so much fun character to it, till now. Anyway, it has a great sound from the exhaust and is a blast to drive. I have not quite gotten the sound system adjusted, but I am coming from a BOSE system in the vehicle I have passed to my wife, so it may never sound that good. All I want to do today is drive drive drive!",3
568,"I've had my new Ram for 1,200 miles and so far no problems. I've towed a tandem trailer with ease and the ride has been very acceptable. The seats are firm but comfortable. Love the storage behind the seats. The stereo sounds wonderful. I average 13.7mpg with trailer and 14.9 without. Lots of hills to traverse. The exhaust brake is fabulous. Run it all the time. So long as you get the truck out on the open road at freeway speed for 45 minutes periodically, the emission system will regen. It's a better and safer system than Ford or Chevy which uses diesel fuel to burn the particulates off. Their fuel mileage suffers for it. Look what happened to Ford and the famous flame out the tailpipe incident",3
569,"Searched and checked out all the small SUVs and found the rogue to have the best combination of comfort, options, quality and price. Compared it to the Honda CRV and Toyota RAV4, test drove those and then finally the drove the Rogue--hands down the better driving experience, sometimes I forget that I am in an SUV and not a car!",4
570,"Just drove this car today during a torrential storm. It was like driving an SUV. Whatever the reviews say, take one for a drive and see for yourself. Where else can you get Vehicle Stability Control, a Toyota Corolla engine, great sound, a cool look and a hatchback to boot for quite a good price? It's a great little car, for the money.",3
571,"I purchased my 2008 Prius in November of 2007 and now have just over 12,000 miles on it. I average between 46 and 50 mpg. It does a little better on highway trips. The car has plenty of room too. In March I took a trip with three other people to Charleston, SC from Ashburn, VA. With four people in the car + luggage the Prius averaged 47 mpg. I cannot say enough good things about this car. Since I have purchased my Prius at least 4 co-workers have purchased hybrid cars because they were so impressed with mine. If you are looking for a new car, go ahead and buy a Prius. You will not regret it.",4
572,"I'm a bit disappointed with my 07 SI Sedan. I've had several problems with it. Tons and tons of interior rattles that can never be fixed, buzzing in the speakers, and now my 2nd gear is grinding like crazy. 2nd and 3rd gear issues are VERY common on these cars, and I'm now having trouble engaging 2nd gear at high RPMs, which is where the SI lives. The car is fun to drive, although it doesn't deliver what it should for its price. At almost 5k cheaper, you get the cobalt SS/ion redline with more performance. For a mere 1-2 thousand more, you get the mazdaspeed3/GTI which has a LOT more spunk and refinement to it. I would suggest checking out the Mazdaspeed3/gti before buying the Honda, sadly.",1
573,"Check out the Sonata, I love mine and I am very glad about my decision to purchase it. And I don't say that lightly. I'm a 12 out of ten when it comes to being particular about my vehicle. See it for yourself, I think you will be impressed. Azera and Genesis here I come!",4
574,This is a wonderful SUV with all the features you would expect from a luxury model vehicle. Best gas mileage compared to other luxury SUV.,4
575,Have had it for two months. Great SUV to drive. Very comfortable ride. MPG is better than other 6 cyl SUVs. Goodyear tires a bit noisy on concrete. High intensity lights are great at night. Bluetooth is great. Owner's manual is very good and describes all the features. Navigation should be a standard feature. It's worth the extra cost.,4
576,"I'm a college student and this is definitely great for that. I bought it new. Once I got an oil change and rotated the tires it drove like a dream. It survived a harsh winter and still holds up. You might need better tires for the snow. I wish the speaker system was a bit better. Also there's a design flaw that causes the windshield to whistle from an air pocket when I drive on the highway. Also the check engine light is on and I've only had the car for a year. The car is really roomy despite its outward appearance. It's definitely a good car. Oh yeah, amazing gas mileage! Saves me money!",3
577,"My husband and I purchased our second Civic about a week ago. Since the very first moment I drove it off the lot, I have heard incessant rattling. I tried various things to get it to stop like moving the headrests, slamming the back seat to make sure it was locked in. Nothing worked. I scheduled a service appt. this past Friday and was told, yes, they acknowledge the rattle and even went so far as to tell me it is coming from the seat belt tensioner, but that it cannot be fixed. Listening to the rattle takes all the fun out of driving the car. I want to be excited about my new car, but I can't. We own a 2007 civic also and that is very quiet - no rattles. Shouldn't they fix it?",2
578,"We looked at everything in a 7 passenger configuration, at the end we where left with the CX9, Honda Oddyssey, and Audi Q7. The Mazda beats them on almost every level. If this car had captains chairs it would have no comparison, not even the Acadia/Outlook.",3
579,"When I had to look for an SUV to replace my 05 Range Rover, I wanted something smaller and hopefully with a bit better fuel economy. I had already leased a BMW X5 and didn't really love it-it was very heavy and ""trucky"". The Lexus R was sort of cheap feeling and I believe if you buy a Lexus or Infiniti, you are paying for the badge not the quality. I thought I would miss the luxury of the Rover, but from the moment I p/u my car I have not looked back. It handles beautifully, feels more like a car, much better mileage already w/o breaking in. The only thing better on the Rover was the navigation.",3
580,"Clean, strong and fast for a big car that gets 26MPG average and 35MPG on the highway. No odor or smoke ever, truly amazing. I have had it about a year now with no problems. I did upgrade to the 18"" wheels for looks. The stock 16"" ones were quiet and smoother ride.",4
581,"My wife has a Prius and I have the Civic. The Civic's gas engine runs more than the Prius' so it's not as fuel efficient but still VERY good at 44 mpg 90% city driving. The Prius shuts off its gas engine whenever it has an opportunity but the Civic does it only when the car is stopped at ""D"" or at VERY light throttle. If the car is in ""Park"", the gas engine will keep running, unlike the Prius. It's much more fun-to-drive than the Prius thanks to its sportier ride and handling. It doesn't have as many gadgets to play with but it has all the essentials. If your only concern is fuel economy, buy a Prius. If you want more fun while saving gas, get a Civic Hybrid.. shorter wait, too! 6wks vs 8+ wks",3
582,"I am electrician and service eastern n.c. I keep record of all gas used. In 3 mo 13,000 miles and 400 gal = 32.5 mpg that's 95% hwy. I have gotten in one tank 27 mpg to 43 mpg in another tank. Most tanks average 30-32 hwy driving on the flatside of Raleigh nc to nc coast. My best hwy mpg has been driving Raleigh nc west to winston- salem nc. I have had it to dealer 4 times and they say computer said everything is working properly. I got the car for the high mpg. gas prices are my enemy. I owed a 91 civic and got 37 mpg. Wish I still had it.",1
583,"The car is smooth and responsive, making for a great handling vehicle. It had surprising acceleration for a 5 cylinder. The leather seats are the most comfortable I have ever had in a car. On trips, the longer I drive this car, the more comfortable it gets. The cargo space is enormous. The interior is well laid out and with the leather package and wood trim, very luxurious for a wagon. Best car we've ever had.",4
584,"It's a nice vehicle but here are the bad things. Heat takes about 10 minutes til you can turn it on, anytime you turn on the climate controls it defaults to air conditioning (the most annoying feature). If you have the Bo speaker system, your subwoofer is mounted on top of the spare tire, so be prepared to take that off when you are broken down on the side of the road. Other then that I like everything else on the car, I know one review said it doesn't have fog lights but mine does, took me awhile to find them. Headlights are also adjustable if they look dim. Upgraded sound system sounds awesome, and it has XM radio! Dealer, Salesman and bestbuy guy that installed my XM all didn't know it.",1
585,"I have owned this car since November of 2007. I absolutely love it! Great trunk space, fun to drive, sporty look, awsome gas mileage and great power for a small engine. It even has a 100,000 mile warranty so I have no worries about my purchase. Oh and I love the mp3 input it's very convenient. Great features for a great price.",4
586,Just bought this van and I am impressed already. This redesigned 08 looks sharp and has all the features you could want without the mark-ups you get from Honda and the other guys. We got the 28N package which puts you into the 4.0L V- 6 at 255hp (Plenty of power on the highway plus more than all of the competition). Inside is great with two DVD screens and the swivel and go seating. Power doors and lift gate make this grocery getter easy to love. Dads don't worry about the minivan stigma because this thing looks and drives great.,4
587,"Have had this car for 1 year and what a mistake. Should have stayed w/Hyundai Accent but they didn't offer a 4dr hatch. Have had a constant speed sensor problem on the auto trans. The car is slow, handles poorly in the snow and less than good gas mileage. Avg 28 combined city/hywy. Should get better mileage w/such a small engine.",0
588,Likes: (1)Price (2)American brand (3)Style improvement over outgoing model Dislikes: (1)Started making rattles from center console (perhaps from fan) within first 1000 mile (2)Noisy engine at idle (3)Screaming engine at full acceleration (4)Terrible sound system for base model (5)Very few options for base model (6)Handsfree bluetooth should be a standard feature,2
589,"This is my second Lexus, and have owned several cars previously. This is probably the best car I've ever purchased. The one flaw is the input control on the nav system, you have to stop the car. If it was a way to design the system so that if the passenger seat is occupied, the the passenger would be able to operate the system. just a thought, otherwise, very nice and enjoyable vehicle to drive.",3
590,"The wife and I have been doing research on small SUVs and we purchased a great one! The Tribute has a ton of standard features and Mazda did a great job with instilling the ""sport"" into driving, even in this SUV. We weren't expecting it to go fast since we opted for the 4 cyl but so far we are impressed. It doesn't have a problem passing, merging, etc. Also the interior quality is 10+. It feels like the knobs to turn the vents are wrapped in leather. And the glossy black dash isn't cheap, it's sturdy polished ABS. Love the car! If you are comparing it to other manufacturers this one has a ton of standard features for less cost than the others.",4
591,I really enjoy driving my Accent. For a small car it is very quiet inside. The manual 5 speed is fun to drive and provides adequate pickup.,3
592,"Surprised by how peppy the engine is, no problem accelerating at highway speeds or up hills. Amount of interior space is impressive and well laid out.",3
593,"Had it for three weeks. Still can't wait to get in and drive it. Extremely impressive performance, great stereo, slick looks, but unimpressive gas mileage - 17/24 mpg. Ad says ""V6 Fuel Economy""...mis-leading to say the least. My daily driver is a '00 Bonneville that gets 25/32 with the 3.8 L V6. I bought it for the overall value and ""driving excitement"", not the mileage. Had a tough time deciding between G8 and Charger R/T. I think I made the right decision. Beware, gas cap door blew off in the automatic car wash! Dealer wants $80 to repaint it. I say it is a design flaw.",3
594,"GM has finally turned it around. The Malibu is once again a great car to own. It rides quiet, the interior is great, and the 4 cylinder engine with the 6 speed auto has great power! I test drove the Camry, Accord, and Maxima and found that the Malibu blew all of them out of the water!",4
595,"So far this car is so much fun. It seems to have tremendous accelerating power and it drives like a dream. It has the sport package and the Conti tires, but it still drives very quietly and feels like total luxury. I just came out of a truck so maybe I just don't notice what the other reviewers are talking about. I chose all black with black birdseye, with premium I, and this car is HOT! So far it's great but I don't have a grip on the mpg yet. So far it's reading 21 on the display and I've been doing mixed driving. Hopefully I will see 25+ on the hwy like others have said. I almost went with another brand, glad I chose the E-class Mercedes. Looking forward to seeing the all new 2010.",4
596,"Ordered back in November, last week we finally got our Red Mica Touring CX-9. It came with 20"" wheels with Homelink (optional). Turn to be an almost perfect ride for families with luggage and bikes although there is space for improvements.",3
597,"This is the 3rd new truck that I bought, the first Dodge ever. Why a Dodge, well, it was the cheapest! It has power, plenty of it! Even with the upgraded 20 inch wheels and 35 inch tires it can tow almost anything with its Hemi. However, it has three problems, fuel is the biggest, never has it come close to what Dodge says it does, on average it gives about 11 MPG, 13 on the highway if the wind is behind you, 10 in town no matter how you drive. Another problem are the stiff seats, they are very uncomfortable after seating for about 30 minutes, I get off and sit in my brother's Chevy 2500, and immediatly notice the diference. The other problem is the off- center stearing wheel to the driver.",2
598,"Perfect in every way. Love the headlights, tail lights, interior, exterior, and 10 spoke bicolor rims that stand out.",4
599,"Was looking for a car for the wife. Leaning towards the Liberty, liked the look etc. and great cash incentives right now. From what I had heard Compass had no go. Test drove the Liberty then the Compass. The minute I drove the Compass knew it was the car she would enjoy. SUV look, had plenty of get up and go, plus the ride was so much better than the Liberty. It was what she wanted and is a lot more than I expected. Only options we got were the automatic, Drivers Convenience Group (recommended), the E Package (power windows etc.), Yes Essentials premium seats (recommended). The car drives great, plenty of room, zips down the freeway. Everything we wanted and more for a great price.",4
600,"Starting off with the negative. The TSX is underpowered for this segment. It also has pretty bland exterior styling. I would also expect better mileage for a 4 cyl engine. Radio is just awful. That said, it is fun to drive and no other car comes close to standard features for the price. Interior of the car is well designed and well made. Everything is well placed and comfortable except the station knob for XM radio. Steering wheel controls only scroll through the presets and if one wanted to simply change stations to something not set as a preset, the reach is a little far while driving. Seats are comfortable, but in a sporty way and they hold the driver in place. Very satisfied overall.",3
601,Traded in 2007 Mazda for this Hyundai. Best move ever. the Sonata is probably the best vehicle Ive owned yet and I trade every year. Sonata is well made quiet and smoother than the other cars I tested prior to buying. This car will probably end my yearly trades. Its a keeper.,4
602,"I was debating between the BMW 3- Series and Infiniti G35 Journey. The G35 would cost the same price with navigation and 300+ HP. I went for the BMW because of the luxurious cabin and sporty exterior. Reliability has been spot-on since day one. Build quality is best I have seen in years. Even with the sport package, the Grey Leather Seats seem to be supportive and comfortable. The Monaco Blue is a great color and it goes well with the Grey Leather. Sport package is definitely worth the extra money. I did not buy the navigation because of iDrive. Xenon is great. This car grips to the road amazing too.",4
603,"I decided to go ""green,"" but was not all that excited about the Prius. But I've been more than pleasantly surprised. The leather seating is a nice touch and the interior is very spacious and comfortable. The electronic controls (radio, climate, etc.) are outstanding, much better than those offered by the German automakers. And performance-wise, the car has some kick. No, it's not a BMW but it's not slow and I really enjoy driving it. The only negative I can think of is that the car is so light that when it's very windy and you're on the highway, you can really feel it.",3
604,"In 18000 miles now, I've been to the dealership 5 times, 4 for service, and once for a check engine light (put crappy gas in it), handles very well, a lot of fun in the rain/snow with traction controll off. Quick off the line. Not quite an STI in performance (heavier and less hp) but really comfortable and a lot nicer inside. Have no doubts about taking clients out in it.",3
605,"I expected more from this car. I've had it for about 9 months, engine has to be broken in by now but the mileage is terrible. Barely get 400km on a tank and thats 50/50 city, hiway. I don't drive that hard either. My friends with domestic v6's get something close to that. It is fun to drive, kind've like a go-cart but because of all the little things, I'm considering trading it in for something else. The auto tranny doesn't work for this underpowered engine either, there's too much downshifting going on at the slightest hint of throttle. I wish I did more research rather than be blinded by the fact that it was a new Honda. BTW the orange colour doesn't work too well for this car.",1
606,"Dubbed ""The Yar-mobile"" by co-workers, everyone including myself is surprised by the amount of room in this hatchback. Going from a Ford Explorer to the Yaris I feel quite comfortable, however my hauling days are over. After my first fillup I get 35.2 MPG city only driving. This car has met all my expectations! I couldn't imagine spending less than $20K (CAD) and getting more bang for the buck in any other vehicle. This is my first Toyota and I am very impressed.",4
607,"I traded my 01 Nissan Altima in for an 08 Honda cr-v. I started my car search at Honda, and five months later, finished it at Honda. This car is excellent to drive. It is my first new car (I've had 3 used ones in the past), and am completely sure I made the right decision.",4
608,"Bought for gas mileage, style, and storage capacity. Mileage varies between 26 - 36, depending on type of driving. Used for vacation and was pleased with capacity, mileage, responsiveness and comfort. Was surprised that there was not much noticeable road noise in most circumstances. A little stiffer suspension than expected on rough roads.",3
609,"Overall, a very nice car with an air of high luxury. As for reliability, had a squealing noise which was a pulley bearing subject to recall. Dealer fixed with no hassle. We now have a strange rattle from the vicinity of the differential. Of course, it stopped when we took the car to the dealer and hasn't yet returned. Performance -- acceleration, braking, handling -- is just okay by my standards but I race cars, so I have high standards. This is primarily my wife's car. For the typical purchaser of this car, the performance is more than adequate. Not too happy about the high depreciation, but we plan on retaining the car for a while.",3
610,"Purchased the vehicle brand new from dealership. At 18k started hearing screeching noise from front tires. Outcome? Complete brake overhaul from calipers, rotors and brake pads, all needed replaced. Dealership said there was no reported issue even though I showed them pages and pages of customer complaints about the brakes. I did this out of my own pocket for the safety of my family. Now before warranty expires the transmission is slipping. We took to dealer said there was a recall and fixed right? Wrong? Today wife had to take back to dealer, $95 bucks to look at it since no longer under warranty. Rental out of my pocket and the outcome is still TBD...... Terrible experience.",0
611,"From the very first moment you can feel the comfort and ease of handling. It almost drives itself, with a smooth ride and fast response. After driving it on a trip, how could you ever consider driving anything else. It's a keeper for me and when I am ready for a new vehicle it will be on the top of my list. Chrysler you did it again, great job as always.",4
612,"Was looking for a stylish car with good gas mileage for my budget. Mazda3 so far is meeting my expectations. Have only driven about 500 miles on it. It has quick acceleration and looks good on inside and out. Love the orange lighting on dash and six disc changer also aux jack is a plus. Glove box is huge and trunk is good size for car. I am getting around 25-28 miles to the gallon, that's with mixed freeway city driving. Engine is a little noisy and first minute of starting up it idles a little rough. I have not noticed much road noise. Takes corners like a champ. Speakers are average, will be replacing with some components soon. If you have extra 5k go with the Grand Touring.",3
613,"I recently brought the car in for some warranty issues as well as a software recall on the ECU. I mentioned to the advisor that when my spouse or 13 yr. daughter sit in the passenger seat, the airbag off light illuminates. They assured me everything was fine and that I could have them take off of school and work to come in and they would teach them how to sit correctly. With some persistence the dealer called me back and confirmed that they cannot get the light to say on with ~105-129lbs. on a brand new STI. The NHTSA says that they never tested that car. SOA told me they did, but it turns out the base Impreza was. Either way, SOA said they will not change anything.",2
614,10 months of driving and still loving this little car. Fuel tank could be bigger but makes me feel better with the cheap fill ups. Traded in a PT Cruiser Limited which was very unreliable and haven't regretted it yet. Great car for the money!,3
615,"Jeep hit a home run with the redesign of the Liberty. This is my 4th Jeep (99' Cherokee, 04' Liberty, 07' Wrangler Unlimited, 08' Liberty) and the best yet! The best on-road ride for an off-road SUV. The engine is sluggish on the on-ramp, but ample everywhere else. Tons of unexpected bells and whistles too. Sky-Slider Roof, Sirius Radio, UConnect, MyGig, etc... Very smart with the nooks and crannies too. The cargo area is adequate and smart. The console and glove compartment are quite large. Soft supple leather, heated seats...I am still finding new things every day. Back to the Sky-Slider Roof...It's like driving a comfortable Wrangler Unlimited at the touch of a button. Shall I go on?",4
616,"Just purchased my new car two days ago. So far, extremely happy with my purchase. As econo-cars go, the Yaris seems to be well thought-out and engineered. There is sufficient room for passengers and the seats are plain but supportive. There are enough bells and whistles to make it feel like a more expensive vehicle. It is stable and nimble to drive, even at highway speeds. Fuel efficiency has been absolutely fantastic.",4
617,"Great car after only 2 days. I'm 6'3"" and this is the only car in the price class that I can comfortably fit in. Merges onto the highway very well, even from uphill on ramps. Very little room for rear seat passengers. Cheap plastics inside, but you get what you pay for in that area. I haven't ridden in the passenger seat, but my 5'10"" girlfriend said it's plenty comfortable.",3
618,My lease was up on my 04 325i. Saw the pics of the c300 and had to see it in person. Immediately fell in love. The ride is superb. The car looks and feels more like an expensive luxo-car. It's comforts are so much better then my BMW.,4
619,"I test drove other regular-sized minivans, and none compared to this. I felt like I was driving a box while driving the other ones. Not fun at all. Once I got into the Mazda5, it was truly ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM! The third rear seat is crampy though, so we only use it for emergencies when we need to haul around 6 people! Otherwise, our doggie fits perfectly with the seats flattend! I would recommend this car to any parent who wants to have enough room to fit everyone and everything, yet still feel young!",4
620,I bought a new LT Avalanche in 2006 and just now traded it in to a 2008. We just wanted the new design. We had no problems at all with our 2006. I love the way they drive and handle. I wish I had paid the difference and got the LTZ package. I love everything about it and hope this one is as good as my 2006.,4
621,"We had debated a mini van for a long time. We purchased a 2006 Civic Hybrid prior to starting foster care...that didn't last long. Shopped around and looked at mini vans from Honda, Toyota, and Kia as well as numerous SUVs and crossovers. Decided on a Used Honda Pilot that was a great vehicle but had some odd problems leading up to a bad climate control system that would have been a pain to fix so the dealership returned our money and we were on the verge of just going up to an 2008 Pilot when we stumbled back into the Odyssey on the showroom. Needless to say, we took it out again and were sold. Not sure why I waited so long! Great ride, lots of room, and great style...",4
622,"After having my 08 Highlander Limited, I must say it is one of the best I have ever had! After having many Toyotas, I wanted to try an SUV, and I'm so glad! The Highlander has all the luxury I was looking for, and a price at the top of my list. The ride is very smooth and quiet, and the V6 is so smooth and quiet, especially in warm climate. In the winter, it is a little loud until warm up, but that is normal as my Avalon was the same. The Highlander has plenty of room, nice dash, and the premium radio is a must! The bluetooth is great for the cell, and is safe while driving. The navigation is easy, and works well. The Blizzard Pearl is a great exterior color. Great SUV. Awesome !",4
623,"We traded in a 2005 Saturn Vue because of our growing family. It is more comfortable, quieter, than the Vue. The Vue was much faster due to the Honda V6 that it had, and it was better on gas. For being rwd, the TrailBlazer did great in the snowy season we had in Detroit Michigan. We never got stuck, or slid off the road. We average 15mpg in the city, and 20mpg on the high way.",3
624,"Absolutely love this vehicle. It is very quick with the V6 engine, and gets great gas mileage (25 mpg) for a 4wd, V6, SUV. The dimension of the vehicle are great too. Not too big, and not too small, and looks great.",4
625,"This is my 3rd Lexus vehicle and looked at Acura RL, Mercedes CLS, Mercedes E, Lexus LS 460, and Lexus ES 350 before purchasing my GS 350. The GS 350 is such a beautiful car unlike anything else on the road within this price range. If you have the money to spend, spend it wisely and get the most car for your money. Black on black with Lexus 18"" chrome wheels, navigation, XM radio, and rear spoiler are such a beautiful combination.",4
626,"Dollar for dollar the Saturn Aura is an outstanding car. The lines of the exterior really look like a more expensive car. We drove the XR and found that there was too much torque and HP for our needs. Also, drove the Malibu. Chevy has more interesting interiors, but, the people at Saturn seem a bit more consumer friendly. The inline 4 has good power and the sound and vibration damping are really well done.",3
627,"We just purchased a 2008 Black Limited w/ navigation and sunroof. Did not opt for DVD since no kids and 3 dogs. Overall first impressions are great. Smooth ride, comfortable, very quiet. Fit and finish looks great. Navigation is easy to use as is the bluetooth function. Voice recognition is a little difficult to setup. Previously owned a Toyota Sienna which had several recalls, not as comfortable, and overall did not impress. Traded a 2007 Hyundai Entourage for Chrysler. The Hyundai was a good van but lacked several features and depreciation faster than you could imagine. Put this van at the top of your list!",4
628,"I love the choice that I made to purchase a Fusion. The ride is very smooth, it has plenty of storage, and everything is easy to operate. Most of all, it is very good on gas.",3
629,"...it gets a whole lot better. This is a very inexpensive car for a Honda, so I am not averse to fixing what I don't like. Odd driving position! I splay my knees out to the sides and use the cruise control as much as possible. I still grumble though. No dead pedal! Zeta dead pedal, HIGHLY recommended. No center armrest! I bought a pricey JDM Honda center console; inexpensive console/armrest addons are available. 22K miles so far and the car is still a pure hoot to drive, which is a big deal for me; boring cars stink. I get close to 40MPG without trying too hard. And it's still cute as a bug. I'm keeping mine!",3
630,"Fun to drive. Front end not very smooth. It feels like it's missing rubber bushings in the front. I hope it is an actual Mercedes and not just a name change from Dodge Durango to Mercedes GL450. It will be very disappointing if that's the case. Otherwise, it is a good vehicle. Also, it's difficult to lift the middle row to get the 3rd row.",3
631,I had a 2005 Scion XB and loved it but it was a little slower than I liked. So I traded it in for the 2008 Scion with the new body style. Love the car. She has enough power to get out of the way of fast approaching vehicles that don't want to let you merge into traffic.,4
632,"I bought this big SUV days ago and it is the best car I ever had. The comfort, technology, engine response and features are way ahead any other SUV at this moment. The new features on the 08 model are exactly the ones I expected and the reason why I never bought a QX before. My previous car was an FX35 which I loved too, but it was kind of small for my family. I highly recommend this vehicle for a test drive, I am sure you won't be disappointed. The ride is much better than the previous version with the improved tire quality (Michelin) and 20"" rims. The traffic feature helps you to avoid congested areas and is easy to use. The downside is fuel economy.",3
633,"I have had my quirky black Yaris liftback for about three months now, and I couldn't be happier. The first couple tanks of gas worried me, because I wasn't getting the mileage I expected, but since then it's been great, between 32 and 40 mpg depending on the mix of driving I'm doing at any given time. I love the styling inside and especially out. Even for an hour-long commute, which I sometimes have to do, the ride is quite comfortable for such a small car. The seats are perfectly comfortable for me. The steering and acceleration are very responsive, which make it fun to drive, not what I expected for such an economical price.",3
634,"But this time I promise never to buy another piece of c**p from Chrysler ever again! Antiquated engine and transmission. Lumber wagon ride and handling, really poor mileage from the very old design PUSHROD engine that has been around since 1989! And talk about quality, it is not anywhere to be found! Misfitting dashboard, poor assembly, mismatched colors, really bad leather that appears fake in the way it wears and fades. We bought it new and the depreciation really hit hard. Sold it for penny's on the dollar! Avoid at all costs, it does not even belong in a rental car fleet!",0
635,"I just recently purchased my 2008 Lancer GTS and I love it! I was the first person to purchase one at the dealership. My GTS is Graphite Pearl Grey, it has the sun and sound package. Drives very well and is very fun to drive. I got the CVT with the magnesium paddle shifters, they are so fun and easy to use! Definitely would recommend this purchase to anyone.",4
636,"The new Tundra in my humble opinion is the best fullsized truck on the market. Fantastic power, turning radius, styling and capabilities. Toyota has finally hit the mark w/ this all new Tundra. It drives like a car. Precise handling and whisper quiet.",4
637,"I have had this car for one week - it is the 2nd Passat I've leased and I'm impressed with it so far. Smooth ride, great handling, fit and finish seem excellent, quiet ride. The Wolfsburg Edition has a lot of content for the price. While the Japanese cars give you a lot of bells and whistles for a few dollars less, the VW is more of a driver's car. I'll trade gee-gaws for real performance everytime.",4
638,"I drove my last truck until it died. When I had to get a new one, I knew I needed an SUV despite high gas prices, because where I live, we get a lot of snow. I bought the AWD Vue, and while I saw on the sticker that I could get about 24 MPG, I was still excited because my old vehicle got more like 8. I'm not a professional hyper-miler by any means, but I am able to coax out 30 MPG on my daily drive to work and back. Add in the very nice design, the awesome feel and power of the vehicle, and I'm getting far more car for my money than I expected when I bought a Saturn. Their ""Rethink"" campaign is fitting, because I have ""Rethought"" my previous view. I love the view from my Vue!",4
639,"Great car, cool looking, hatchback is cooler looking but I like the huge trunk room of the sedan. Rides great for econ car, better than most mid size cars. Lots of room for long legged people. Acceleration is good, not that I really care about that, the car has lots of options and standard options I like. Best looking car of its class, very modern look. It is Our 1st Nissan and so far we are very impressed. Easy to park, even in city. Ride is nice , I have a bad back so I feel all the bumps on the road and it is the only econ car that I have ridden in that doesn't cause me undue pain, and comfy seats, and head doesn't hit roof when on bumpy roads like some econ cars. THE BEST.",4
640,"I was considering the 3-series, 5- series, and Acura TL in addition to this vehicle. I'd have been happy with any of them I think, but the CTS had that extra bit. The technology was abundant and easy to use. The performance was amazing on twisty lake side roads. I've driven it about a 1000 miles so far on business trips and my customers gush over it and I sit in comfort the whole while. Get the air conditioned seats! I also appreciated the DFI engine over the standard and am getting about 28 mpg on the freeway. 20 mpg in town.",4
641,"This is our third Passat (first a 1993) and it is the best. The car feels like a much bigger and more expense automobile. No problems and only expense is the scheduled maintenance. I alternate between Plus and High Test gasoline and runs great. I was most impressed by the highway MPG. I always get between 31 and 32 MPG with one trip turning in 35. I would recommend changing the oil more often than VW recommends. 10,000 miles seems a little long.",4
642,"I read dozens of reviews on this site before I bought my very own Yaris just 6 hours ago! What an awesome little car! I'm 6' 2"" and 262 pounds and this car has plenty of room for me. The A/C will freeze you to death, the fuel efficient engine has more than enough zip to make driving fun again. It looks great, drives great, handles great, and I love it. Mine has factory cruise control, so it is available for the hatchback. I love this car :)",4
643,"We did a lot of research before we bought this vehicle. We were replacing our 98 Ford Windstar, we wanted better gas mileage, but still versatility. So we rented this vehicle for the weekend, highly recommended. Took it to the ocean and for the weekend and got 25mpg (200m 60% Hwy & 40% city). It handles worlds over a minivan, fun to drive, and parking lots are easy. Purchase process, we talked to the car sales arm of the rental agency, said we wanted dark as possible interior and 7 seater, they brought in a Silver exterior, with black interior. Ultimately we purchased it for $13,000 with 7,000 miles on it and we have gotten 21.8mpg strictly in town driving, that is what we expected.",3
644,"After having driven sporty cars (last car a Mustang) for most of my life and having read your review I was expecting something much more pedestrian than the Escape turned out to be. It was comfortable from the get-go, handles very well and accelerates smartly. It is not choppy riding (try comparing it to a Focus SVT). Friends have commented on how smooth the ride is and how comfortable the car is. The power steering is well-balanced but could do with a bit less assist. I do not find any problem with the braking nor with gentle acceleration. Fuel economy is decent--not horrible but not super. In my case I use a gallon more fuel per week than I used to with my Mustang.",2
645,"This is an outstanding vehicle for the money if you are interested in a 4 door sedan. Of all the cars that I have owned, this is my favorite. I really like the treatment I receive by the dealer, and OnStar is a must. This car has been completely trouble- free so far. My only complaint would be the low roof line which requires you to duck as you enter the front seats or you will bump your head.",3
646,"I really enjoy this 7 series. This is my third 7, and I like the tight feel of driving. The power is intoxicating as it moves! I like the improved iDrive. It is easier to use. The car also fits my size as I am 6'1"" and need enough room. It works well with my iPhone, too. Owning this car is a real joy.",4
647,I own a Double Cab PreRunner long bed truck. I like the SR5 option package. Good mpg around 18.,3
648,"I have been a Chevy man for years, an I love old car, and then when I read this was the last year of the PT Cruiser I knew I had to have one. I love the way this car looks I love the way it drives. I just love this car.",4
649,"Excellent fit and finish, great power, good sound system, very much improved rigidity and suspension.",3
650,"I test drove so many cars (Camry Hybrid & 4 cyl, Prius, Altima, VW GTI, Highlander, CRV, G35)! My most recent car was a 00 Mercury Cougar, 5 spd V6. I was seeking better MPG and more room since I frequently take road trips and don't pack lightly. I wanted something that held its value and wouldn't constantly be in the shop. So far I am THRILLED! I love my Civic more and more every time I drive it! I get a combined 34-38 MPG! I drove it from FL to NC, NC to FL and back again. I averaged about 40-42 MPG! I am also very comfortable when I am driving! I like the fact it's quick and blind spots aren't too bad either. They can be so much worse. Road noise can be pronounced at times.",4
651,"I haven't found anything not to like at this point. We've only had the vehicle a couple days, but the wife, who is typically a small car driver (5'3"") absolutely loves it and has not had a hard time adjusting to its size. Very comfortable, very spacious. Very happy! We were thinking Rav4, Pilot, Outlook, and Highlander and it was a no brainer after a test drive. Limited rode nice, but the Sport is much more controlled, less floaty. Make sure you test drive both before you buy!",3
652,"I purchased the Rabbit a week ago, and am enjoying the well-designed interior and great drive very much. I find the car very well-named as it feels very much like a quick and nimble little rabbit. My only caution is the engine noise, and I feel the 2.5 to be quite thrashy-rattling around 2,000-2,500 RPM under acceleration. I am sincerely hoping that this is not due to a developing engine problem. Time will tell and I will update periodically.",3
653,"You will not be disappointed with this CUV. We love it! Buick has hit a home run with the Enclave. We traded in a '01 Expedition with the same 1st and 2nd row captain chairs as the Enclave. I'm 46 and I never thought I'd own a Buick but I don't regret it at all. For the money, the seating configuration, capacity, features, performance, this is an absolute bargan. We were closely looking at the GMC Acadia (which is great as well) but the luxury, quiet ride, looks won us over. We looked at many other brands in this segment but there were very few that could seat 7 with the dual captain chairs. The V6 has plenty of power and transmission seems to shift smoothly for us. Great job Buick! We are very satisfied. GM should use this as an example to improve their bottom line.",4
654,"I have owned the last three versions of the Grand Prix and each one has become more technologically advanced and stylish than the last while build quality and interior design has become progressively inferior. My 2007 Grand Prix pales in comparison to the interior design and materials in my 2000. Mesh-like headliner and sun visor material scream ""cheap."" The plastic interior pieces are visually and physically ""hard"". The carpet is coarse and the leather doesn't even smell like leather. Heck, I'm a Grand Prix lover and I'm embarassed for GM. It would seem that the Grand Prix has been allowed to suffer the same agonizing death as its Pontiac brothers. Sorry GM, my next car will be Japanese.",1
655,"I've had this vehicle for one week. I replaced a 2004 model Tacoma Double Cab with this one. They finally moved the clock! Has more power, doesn't seem to take up more room in the garage, but feels larger. Brakes don't feel as mushy as the old style eiher.",3
656,Bought my Mini new in 2/08 and the fuel pump went out at 17000 miles. Although it was covered under warranty I can only guess what troubles lie ahead. I also had to replace one of the run flat tires to the tune of $249. The car is fun to drive and I have adequate space since I no longer have young kids to transport. But once I experience a major mechanical failure I start looking for a new car. I plan to buy a new Honda or Toyota in 2/10.,1
657,"Just drove our new Kia Sportage home yesterday. We owned an SUV prior to this purchase, but unfortunately it got totaled when I hit a patch of ice last week. After being used to driving an SUV (we had a mini-van prior to that) I don't like the feel of a car, so we test drove the Kia Sportage and the Rav 4. Both performed well, but when it came to price the Kia won. Almost bought a Kia several years ago but didn't like the way they drove. The 2007 model has greatly improved Kia's performance and reliablity tests.",2
658,"I did quite a bit of research before buying my new car. In fact, I used Edmunds and the consumer reports as my guide. I liked the Freestyle right away. It had everything I was looking for and then some.",3
659,Previously owned a 2004 Max. The 07 is improved in both interior and exterior. The cvt is very smooth and torque steer greatly reduced. Acceleration about the same,2
660,"I have 90 mile daily commute, good mpg required, thus had to pass on any V6 SUV's. CR-V won't thrill with acceleration, but I routinely have 4 adults, a baby, and a load of Costco purchases aboard, and it handles hills and merges just fine. Nimble handling, good sight lines, excellent brakes. 2008 had several crazy snowstorms in Pacific NW. CR-V AWD handled quite well, although the stock Bridgestone tires not the greatest and at 32k are almost spent. Nary a squeak or rattle, except for a whistling sound from the A/C every so often. Rogue was a close second, having Bluetooth, Xenon, Bose, but also fixed rear seat and headrests, and a little less solid feeling.",4
661,"This is our second BMW, we are so disappointed with the quality of construction. The front bumper, a pathetic piece of plastic just buckled and fell when going over a bump. Told by a BMW service agent that this is happening so frequently with the x3 that people are not even bothering to fix the bumper, they just drive around with it hanging. This is unconscionably poor construction, design and quality. There are other issues with the quality of materials used in the construction of this car. This is definitely our last BMW and if it wasn't a lease, I would get rid of it immediately.",0
662,"Love it. 4dr sedan S is the way to go. So many features for a car that cost 16K. Getting around 40 MPG on the highway. Car is great, recommend it.",4
663,"This is the smoothest, most comfortable, versatile truck in the world. I bought a new LT last year and dad and I made a trip up to WI., from Florida. He couldn't believe it was a pick up truck. It truly has a better ride than my wife's Cadillac. The storage is awesome and abundant and the cabin is as comfortable as sitting in a lazyboy in your living room. The only thing I don't like is that my wife likes it better than her new Caddy, so it looks like we will probably have 2 of them in the near future. You can really dress these trucks up too if you're in to that. Chevrolet never seems to advertise these trucks. If they knew what they were doing, they would put everyone else out of business.",4
664,"I had driven the other competitors; Accord, Camry, Altima, Saturn, Jetta and Malibu. I was planning to purchase the Altima, when I saw the Ford commercial for the Fusion SE Sport. Drove the car and was really surprised by the quality and features of the car. I bought the 4 cyl for gas mileage and a teenager who is about to drive. If gas was $2.50 a gallon, I would have bought the 6 cyl. Ford has built a good car with this one. When it comes time for my daughter to drive, she may not get to drive this one.",3
665,"I just purchased my 2007 Scion tC and I LOVE it. It has a smooth ride and has so much space for all passengers to be comfortable. The design is great on this inside and outside, and I get tons of compliments on it. The controls are easy to use and the sound system is fantastic. Oh yeah, the moonroof and reclining seats don't hurt either.",4
666,"We started looking early 2007, but really wanted to see the Enclave. Test drove Edge, Pacifica, and Veracruz. We finally got to see the Enclave and it was truly spectactular. We just had a hard time finding one to buy. People come up to us all of the time and want to see the car and want to know about it! I have only had Lincoln Continentals for the past 20 years, so this was a big step to buy a Buick. We have not been dissapointed. It is actully shorter and narrower than my Lincoln (more room in the garage!)",3
667,"My check engine light has been on 3 times since March, two dealers cannot find the problem, so they reset the computer and send me on my way. And my leather seat was defective, that has been replaced. Did I mention my bluetooth has been replaced also, all of this before the 6,000 miles mark. What a lemon. If you own a Nissan, good luck if you have a warranty issue.",0
668,I bought my Yaris about 2 months ago and so far it is meeting all my expectations. The dealer only had one lift-back and one sedan on the lot the day I was there. I chose the lift-back over the sedan because I didn't want a car that looked like every other car out there. This car is different - it draws a lot of attention. I love that this car is roomy and comfortable to drive. Compared to my last 2-dr this car is easy to get in and out of the back seat. I am getting around 35 mpg and hope for better as I continue to break her in - but even if 35 is the best I get it beats my last car by 10 mpg so I'll take it! It's a lot of car for the size and the price. Very satisfied.,4
669,"This is my second TrailBlazer to purchase. The first one I had for four years with vitually no mechanical problems. I love the 2008 and the cosmetic changes to the front and rear end and the wheels! Great black leather interior, sun roof and 6 disc cd. It is really fun to drive and looks good. OnStar is a nice security feature too",3
670,"I have been very happy with this car. It is comfortable, zippy when needed, and quite economical. I am averaging 48 MPG, but expect more when I learn to drive it better. I highly recommend the navigation system, the bluetooth connection, and the leather interior. I have give my friends rides and they are really surprised at how comfortable it is to ride in.",3
671,"I picked up my '08 Vue at the end of the '08 redtag event. It was a demo, so it had a couple thousand miles on it, but that also helped make the car extremely affordable. I love the look and the feel of the car. I traded in a VW Rabbit for the car, so this has 100 more HP and the AWD makes the winter weather conditions almost nonexistent. Despite everything I love about the car, it broke down on me within 500 miles of purchase. The dealership said that the computer logged nearly 900 codes, but that once they were cleared they could not identify the specific problem and chalked it up as symphony of glitches at occurred at the same time. Needless to say, my fingers are crossed.",2
672,"Ever since I first saw the Mazda 3, I knew I wanted one. As soon as I saw the interior and took it for a test drive, I knew I wanted it. I was a little worried about the way the car sounded on the road, but I'm used to it now. For all of the features, I think this car is at the perfect price. My friends and family love riding in my car, and it is definitely more fuel efficient than my old accord!",4
673,"Unlike shopping for other vehicles, in choosing a smart, you decide on what you don't need. Do you need to chauffeur people? Do you need to buy fuel frequently? Do you need to spend time looking for a parking spot? Do you need zippy acceleration? Do you need trunk space that will hold more than a suitcase or two? If you answered, ""No,"" to one or more questions, then the smart deserves consideration. Yes, the ride can be poor to fair, but the very comfortable seats make up for a lot. Yes, the transmission doesn't shift that smoothly, but it can be described kindly as ""easy going."" It's okay in the city, and on the highway, once you're up to speed, does it really matter? I love it.",3
674,While this is a pretty neat auto the road noise will take away many points. We traded a 2004 Ford Explorer on this car mainly because of the horrible road noise we got with the Ford. We have a neat new auto with almost the same tee same level of noise. We did not notice on the 2 test drives as both days were extremely windy. The dealer now tells me that there is no insulation on this vehicle as it is considered in the Civic family. We were told that the top end Accord and Oddessy would have insulation and be much quieter. Great! The fuel economy is not that great for a 4 cylinder either.,1
675,"I took my new car out last night for the 1st drive and caught stares, wolf whistles, shout outs (""Outrageous car!"") and even growls from people passing us and from people on the street. This is a fun car to drive, hugs the curves, rides smooth, is surprisingly comfortble (seems to form- fit my body) and looks much more expensive than its affordable price tag states. So many of the little ""extra touches"" and features make this car appear expensive - chrome on the inside, OnStar, ""wings"" coming back from the roof line top, hand controls on the steering wheel, the front lights, Porsche shaped side windows... all nice touches. Great design.",4
676,"I originally had a 2006 Fusion but traded it in on the 07 because I wanted the side airbags and more features. I drive 80 miles (mostly hwy) a day to work doing 75mph. In the warm months I've been getting 27-29 mpg 90%hwy, in the winter it drops around 24 mpg. It had a rattle in the dash doing 40-50mph at1600rpm. The dealer fixed it, they said there was a Ford service bulletin something on the firewall was the cause of the rattle. If you are in the market for this size car, I highly recommend it, good reliable, fun to drive, huge trunk, and plenty of power.",3
677,"I just got my new Olive Mist 4dr Yaris. I just got to 200 miles and have no complaints, it is the cutest thing, people think it's a Volkswagen. Since having this I wouldn't trade it for anything; it has great pickup and turning corners is a blast. I like the cupholders where they are, it's kinda different. Gas is also GREAT, like I said, made it to 200 miles and still have over half a tank left! Get one!",4
678,"The 07 CR-V is a great vehicle. While some claim that the fuel efficiency is not what the company claims, this is largely due to your driving style. The mpg indicator on the dash shows you how your driving is effecting your MPG use...you learn to drive better with the CR-V. I am getting 25 city and 32 highway with the LX model. Interior cloth is very nice and easy to clean. Rear storage space is quite large, especially when you fold up the seats. Outside the CR-V is up to par with other, more expensive small SUVs.",3
679,"There's a lot to like with the latest Tacoma truck. Nice interior and the V6 is smooth and powerful. Its size is just right. Issues? The auto trans doesn't seem to shift right. Rear springs are weak (I had to replace and I don't haul anything heavy) or put up with it bottoming out. Front end gets out of alignment easily. Does the PreRunner really need to be be so high off the ground? I'd like better MPG, but at least I can get 20 or better.",2
680,"I was originally thinking about an Impala or used Camry. I am very glad I chose the Fusion. I have averaged 32- 34 MPG on two lane highway, 29-30 MPG on interstate and overall about 27 MPG. We have one young child under a year old and have plenty of room for everything during our long trips home (~400 miles). The only drawback is turning radius which I was aware of before buying the car, but it does not turn on a dime, more like a nickel. I have 13,000 miles on it already and have enjoyed them all. I drove several late model Dakota's previously and this car is just as fun and enjoyable to drive. I recommend it fully.",3
681,"Lots to love about this car. For the low price, you get AWD, tight suspension, pretty good MPG, fun, and room. The base stereo (4 speakers) is actually OK and doesn't distort at high volume. I will be adding the Subaru subwoofer soon. The ride is great and the car feels like it has claws that attack the road. 5 spd is fun since you have more control. Trunk loses some space as it raises toward the back because of the new double wishbone suspension. Interior is good for the price. Plastic used on the door and dash, but for $16k I don't mind. I like the looks of the 2007 better, but oh well. The 08 is more ""grown up"" looking.",3
682,"My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed our Prius. It is comfortable, fun to drive and so far very reliable. I just wish Toyota or someone made a small pickup hybrid that got 40-50 mpg! We have tracked fuel economy and found that in the winter months we averaged 48 mpg and the rest of the year it is 52 mpg. That is 70% city driving and the rest is highway. The lower gas mileage during the winter is a combination of cold air AND winter gasoline formulation, which means that ALL gasoline cars gets less mpg in winter, not just the Prius.",3
683,"Love the truck! Small problems due to Toyota quality slipping. Rattle in door, kick panel loose, front end out of line at delivery, now my tail gate latch broke after only opening the gate maybe a half dozen times. Still love the truck but you do not expect these little problems from a Toyota.",3
684,"I traded in my 06 Tacoma Prerunner Double Cab Long Bed TRD Sport for an SR5 Crewmax Short bed with 5.7 6 AT. The Crewmax takes regular gas at 87 octane compared to the 92 octane that the Tacoma required. The Tundra accelerates with ease, and the ride is very smooth. I love the rear seat space. It is huge back there, and my family can relax during long drives from Vegas to Orange County. So far, the Tundra is a winner. I just hope that my 5.7 is not one of those with a defective camshaft that grounded about 20 5.7s so far.",4
685,"After test driving the C class Benz, my husband and I stopped at the Infiniti dealership. I was impressed by all the extras and once I drove it, it was a sale. Awesome vehicle for the family and I have pre teenagers. My oldest son is very tall and it's a tad bit head bumping when you go across a hump, but it is fun, sporty, luxurious, simply perfection. I've owned a civic, accord, prelude, saturn, expedition, suburban, mustang, quest... no comparison. I'm in love with my vehicle. I'm averaging 20-no compliants from me! Not one single complaint.",4
686,"I recently purchased this car, so I don't have many miles on it yet. My first impressions are it has a very nice build-quality, perfect for the family, and the (AWD) all-wheel-drive is spectacular! I previously owned a BMW 528 and going to a cross-over like the Tribeca was easy.",3
687,"Just got the Nitro r/t 1mt ago for my wife we love this veh, had a 03 Cadillac CTS and by far this is a better vehicle to drive and just love the looks inside and out it will make heads turn as you drive by someone,",4
688,"I've previously owned a Camry and recently traded my Solara for the 2008 Avalon. I have no complaints. I am a tall women and there's plenty of leg/head room, 3 avg sized adults fit comfortably in the back seat, tons of trunk space, and good price. Horsepower and handling are great. I can zoom uphill, through traffic and curves with ease. Avalon luxury is, at its best, highly comparable to Lexus without the price tag. It's a smooth, quiet, spacious ride - especially when you have a long commute to work everyday. Best car purchase I've made to date. The exterior design is beautiful. I am constantly being approached with compliments. I would recommend the Avalon to all.",4
689,"This is my 3rd Jeep. My 1st was a 94 with the 5.2 V8 and my 2nd a 01 with the 4.7 V8. I recently got the Limited with the 5.7 Hemi and Quadra-drive 4X4. Every option available on the car was ordered. I have always been a big Jeep fan, but this new model is much more refined than expected. I compared to ""luxury"" SUVs, and for the price, there is no comparison. The engine has plenty of pep, and the interior is nicer than the Lexus or Infinity I looked at. I don't care what the reviews say, the Jeep is as big as any ""crossover"" in terms of interior space, but the build quality is much higher of any SUV I looked at. This is definitely a huge contender against any SUV you look at.",4
690,"This Jeep's top leaked since day 1. It has been in to be repaired 6 times and out of service more than 30 days. I have filed under lemon law /and was given a mediator /with no resolution. 5 months later I was forced into buying a foreign used car so I could get to work. I do not recommend this Jeep to any! Chrysler does not back product, they sure can sell you a car, but service is not there anymore. Stay away",0
691,"I chose the V6 model because I wanted a balance between performance and fuel economy. So far I have really enjoyed the car. Acceleration is adequete, and it handles very nicely. The seats are comfortable, and the car is nice and quiet; this makes it relaxing on the way home from work. I'll agree with others and say that I don't like the placement of the climate controls. I also wish the transmission had an autostick option, or at least a choice of 1,2,D instead of just L or D.",3
692,"I am a first time SUV owner. I test drove the Toyota Rav4, Ford Escape and Honda CVR. This was the most car for the money. Lots of safety features and the driver's information center is very useful. Have had lots of compliments on the style of this vehicle. I would recommend it without hesitation.",4
693,"I love my new Chevy Malibu. I cannot believe how well built it is. I've always been a Chevy driver and have never been disappointed but, man, Chevy outdid themselves with this vehicle. I wouldn't even think about buying an Accord or Camry. The Malibu LTZ feels and looks like it costs at least $10- $20,000 above what I paid for it. Well done Chevy!",4
694,"When I first drove the car I fell in love with it and immediately bought it. The very responsive engine coupled with 18"" performance tires made this car fun to drive. Just two months later and the clutch has way too much transmission feel and the gas consumption is not even close to the quoted technical specifications. Unless my dealer can solve the consumption issue I am estimating that this car will cost me $400-500 more per year than I should expect based on quoted estimates. In terms of the clutch, the feel has drastically changed from when I first took delivery. My dealer is claiming that it is operating normally. I hope this is not a sign of things to come.",1
695,"I fell in love with the Aura as soon as I saw one on the road. It has a very european finish on its exterior and that caught my eye immediately. I am bored looking at the Japanese sedans on the roads and Aura was a welcome. I got my XE way b4 it won the car of the year award at the auto-show and I was proven right. The car perform very well - particularly on the highways. It is fun to drive and the engine seems to always have some juice left in it no matter what speed you are driving at. Ask a Camry to beat that. Road noise is minimal, and the car steers beautifully on curvy interstate roads. I enjoy my drives on the open road and have clocked 17k miles in 9 months without a whimper. Go Aura.",4
696,"My wife and I chose the CR-V over the Rav4, Rogue & Outlander. MPG is pretty accurate to spec. City/Hway/Combined - 20/26/22. Had to get used to the arm rests. Feels like it has way more headroom and interior space compared to the competition. Love being able to adjust rear seats foward/back. No blind spots. Acceleration isn't the most powerful, but not too bad getting on the highway.",3
697,"100 miles/day and the car is great. Comfortable, but the S needs a center arm rest. Very smooth ride and handles very well. Most interior room of any small car we tested (Yaris, Elantra, Cobalt, Mazda3, Corolla). I'm 6'2"" and leg room was very important. This is a great buy for your money. 32 MPG when I drive reasonably, 29 MPG when I keep up with Chicago traffic at 80 MPH.",3
698,"If you're buying a minivan, you can not beat the value of this Hyundai. It's at the very least neck and neck with Toyota and Honda and the price is far and away a better deal. Go for the Limited with all the bells & whistles and you won't look back. If you're nervous about a first year vehicle, get the dealer to give you free maintenance for 12 months, that should alay fears of unknown bugs in the design. Minivan's are all about functionality, they were designed for one purpose: ease the travel & logistics life of a family, and Hyundai is one of the best before price is even in the equation. Hyundai has put together an excellent package; can't wait for the editor's review & validation!",4
699,"Until a few weeks before I purchased the car, I even didn't know about the car nor seen before. I fell in love with the car right away. It's such a cute car. I get a lot of attention on the road. I really enjoy it. Small car with a lot of power and charm.",4
700,"This car is a play toy for the wife and me. Got the automatic for her, but no regrets. Between the V6 and the Sportronic mode I can have my fun. Love the looks, power, handling and that awesome stereo. Plenty of room in the front seats. The back seat is for kids only, but hey it's a convertible. It's not supposed to be practical. A great fun car to cruise the scenic backroads with. The sunset pearlescent paint and the body style really gets attention. This is the most expensive car we have ever bought. It has all the options.",4
701,"We are senior citizens and bought this car for the ease of getting in and out and wanted to sit up a bit higher when driving. This car surprised us with how much fun it is to drive. It is very smooth handling and so far great on gas, getting the 27 mpg it was said to get. It feels like you are driving a much smaller car. We had a Honda Accord before and this one handles much nicer believe it or not. You will not be sorry if you buy this car. You will love it.",4
702,"A few days into ownership and it is a perfect work commuter car. Size and mass matters when it comes to build purpose, operational function, and safety. ""It is what it is"", and 700,000 sales around the world since 1998 speaks for itself.",4
703,"Traded in a Ford Explorer XLT due to gas mileage. I am a piano technician and have to carry tools at all times. This was a great choice after searching for 3 months. Compared American, Japanese and Korean cars. I wanted the Prius, but there were none to be had, and then dealers were selling for ""market price"". I made a great choice for me. I am 6'3"" and above 250 lbs. Comfort is there for leg room, but to me, seat surfaces are not soft enough. That being my only complaint of the inside, everything else is great. I love the stereo-great sound and flexibility; cd changer, ipod & xm to Aux input is fabulous. Easy to work. Car well laid out. Easy to read instruments.",3
704,"So far I owned brand new, a 1996 ram, 2001ram, 2006ram, and now 2008 ram big horn. By far the best truck on the road. Comfortable ride, as well as nice and quiet. Has the MDS system in it which saves gas, although it can use it when you lay on it for the fun. The big Hemi 345 hp engine is great. I am really pleased with this big bad boy of a truck. And very tough to. As well as being great in winter weather. 4x4 is a plus. Works great and has a lifetime powertrain warranty.Seating is confy, but can be tight in the back for long legs. Otherwise, there is no other truck you can add to that makes this beast sound like it does.",4
705,"I read every review about the Magnum I could find before buying it as I was concerned about how the AWD would perform and if the 6 cyl was enough power. I live in NY but found the car in Iowa since they didn't make many '08's trying to find a loaded SXT AWD was difficult. I am thrilled I bought this car. The AWD works great in the snow and the 3.5 engine moves the car around very well. I am more pleased with the car and the performance then I expected to be. Right now these cars are a great buy and I highly recommend it. Don't be afraid of going with the 3.5 V6, it handles the weight of the car fine, it does not feel underpowered. Blinds spots are not that bad either.",4
706,"I started driving a Cadillac when Oldsmobile stopped building the original Aurora. I travel from Florida to Atlanta, GA and the ride is comfortable, quiet, and smooth, my companion reads a book all during the drive. On one trip my cruise control stopped working, I hit my OnStar button and they made an appointment for me at a dealership near where I was staying. The service manager was waiting for me and the problem was solved. He called me to make sure everything was completed to my satisfaction.That is Cadillac quality and servuce.",3
707,Too much plastic. Window gears gave up at 2100. Soft as a truck and hard as a sedan - pick one and stay with it if you're GM. Gave it back to corporate HQ before 3500 miles. Got myself another Taurus!,1
708,"We love out Jeep Liberty. This SUV is so practical and fun to drive. It meets all our needs, fits great in the garage, has not had any problems and looks great. We are very happy with it. Would get another one.",4
709,"Wow! So much to say, so little space. I have been looking and researching this segment for nearly five years. I really wanted a Tacoma, but even with the low car sales plaguing the industry, Toyota didn't want to play. Honda immediately offered me an incredible deal on this 08 RTS that I didn't need any more incentive- I snatched it up. This is an incredibly smart truck- all space is usable; seats are comfortable, even in the back where I was concerned most because this often overlooked space is easiest to get cheapest attention (Chevy Colorado). Absolutely the smartest design in this category (if you're looking for heavy hauling, look to full size trucks); fits me like a glove. LUV IT!",4
710,I did the research on the sports cars. I test drove this car and loved it. Superior in many ways to competition. A bargain for the horsepower and design. This car turns heads. I love it.,4
711,"The 2008 Tundra is a fantastically well engineered vehicle. I use it to tow a large 2 horse BP trailer (loaded weight approximately 6700 lbs./ 600 lbs. tongue weight) to and from horse shows from Pennsylvania to Maine. It tows comfortably and most importantly safely. Fuel mileage while towing at interstate speeds is 11.5 mpg, non- towing 17.5 mpg. Very respectable fuel economy for this type of truck. Additionally I get positive comments everywhere I go on how nice the truck looks fitted with a Leer 100XL cap. I highly recommend this truck for towing & hauling.",4
712,"My biggest dissapointment with this car is gas mileage. Granted, I am averaging about 38 MPG, but nowhere near the stated 51 MPG. I could have bought a Chevy Aveo or Honda Fit for much less money. Quality is surprisingly poor - had to take car to dealer for leaks around the hatch area several times. Car is very uncomfortable for long trips- OK for jaunts around town. Seats are very hard and unsupportive. Performance is very iffy especially merging on freeways. When pressed too hard you get the feeling that the thing is about ready to break. Great second or third car, but not adequate for all- around duty.",1
713,"I bought the VUE because I use public transportation and mainly needed an errand/recreational vehicle--so, mpg wasn't that important to me. Since I'm averaging 18 mpg city driving, I'm really glad I don't need it as my commuting car. That said, the car is nicest thing I've driven and rides like a dream. I have the leather interior package and the heated seats, lumbar support, and climate control is just fantastic. My back windshield fluid sprayer doesn't work, but that's a factory problem and the dealership will fix it.",3
714,This is the first car I have owned in past 15 years. Always drove a pickup. Wanted something that would do well in the snow and be fun to drive. So far have not been disappointed. This car with AWD does great in the snow and is a blast to drive. Love the size of the trunk.,3
715,"I have owned this car for a couple of months now, and all I can say is wow. Though it is down on horsepower compared to the BMW 335, it completely makes up in looks. Two months ago, I was at a stop light on a main road. A man was too busy looking at my A5, he drove into the car in front of him. I love the fact I got parked in front of the restaurant by valet. I love that I cannot go a night without a compliment, I just love the car.",4
716,"I just purchased a 2008 Impala LT with 33,000 miles on it and it's one of the best cars I ever owned. The car runs great. I needed a dependable roomy car for my daily 75 mile round trip to work and after doing a lot of research focused on the Impala. After finding a great deal I jumped on it. It's a great value compared to other cars in it's class. I would by another one without hesitation. Every time I drive it confirms that I made an excellent choice. The performance could be a little better when accelerating from a complete stop and the side view mirrors could have been a little bigger but over all I am thrilled with my purchase. I would recommend the car highly.",4
717,"Not sure why so many national reviewers are giving this vehicle so much grief. I have the RT with the 2.4L 5spd Manual. Coming from a V6 SUV, I think this car has a lot of pep. Love the color options, my model is Black ext with black and red accents interior. Very roomy in the front. Although, I wish they narrowed steering column. Having short legs I have to be a little closer to the steering wheel. My legs scrape getting in and out.",3
718,"I purchased an 06 ML500 to replace my 2001 ML430. Loved it so much I just purchased a 2008 ML550. The motor is fantastic. The 550 is so smooth and fast, it blows away the 500 engine. Heated and cooled front seats, air suspension, and 19"" AMG rims make the car the ultimate long distance cruiser. Handles the Canadian winter with no problem, and takes us skiing every weekend in style with heated rear seats for the kids. As my 4th ML since 1999, this one can't be beat. We plan to keep the ML500 and ML550 for a long time.",4
719,"Has all the features you want: memory seats, leather, blue tooth, sat. radio, peppy motor and trans, comfortable seats, sunroof, all standard.",3
720,"After tons of research, we went with the Santa Fe. Consumers top pick for mid-size SUV. With the warranty and price, seemed like a good deal. Gas MPG is about 20 for city driving. Got the premium package. Heated seat are nice.",3
721,"I purchased this vehicle for hauling mountain bikes, light yard work, camping and the occasional light towing job. Thus far, I have not been disappointed. Everything is well laid out and the storage is awesome. Plenty of power to enter Houston freeways with ease or tackle any jeep road. Purchase the sound shield and paint shield. Paint seems a little thin and scratches easily but hey, it's a truck! Highly recommended. Serves my purposes and then some.",4
722,"I have owned my V6 XLT for three months and I have been very happy with my purchase. I don't need to haul large or heavy objects very often, so the small bed works for me. The ride is comfortable and composed. The V6 has plenty of power and everything has been reliable. Ford needs to work on the fuel economy. I am not dissappointed with the mileage, but I think Ford could do better.",3
723,My previous vehicle was a luxury SUV which I only used to go back and forth to work. I purchased this vehicle because of the fuel economy and reliability of a Honda. I am completely satisfied with my choice at this time. I have about 1000 miles on the car and my fuel economy is 34 mpg which more than doubles my SUV. I have only driven the car to and from work and have not yet been on a highway. I haven't found anything wrong with the vehicle to this point. I am very pleased and a little surprised with the pep this car has. I would highly recommend this car for someone looking for an excellent commuter vehicle,4
724,"This car is fantastic! Fun to drive, very comfortable, and gets up to speed fast! I drive 25 miles on the interstate every day and this car makes the drive enjoyable. Headlights are great, gas mileage is wonderful, and I am a very satisfied driver!!",4
725,"I bought my Hyundai in August of 2007 and haven't looked back since. It's reliable, fun and roomy. When comparing to other similar type vehicles (equinox, RAV, etc.,) you simply can't beat the reliability and price.",4
726,"I've been driving a midsize SUV and been waiting for this kind of fuel efficient crossover long time. Test-drove Murano, but heck, it's too overpriced. Finally I test drove an Edge and just I was sold to it. The fuel economy is much better than I expected and the vista roof gives me a huge view to the sky, which is terrific. So nice looking outside and very BIG inside. The inside space is one of my favorites. The gauges and controls are convenient and friendly. V6 and auto go very well together. I love to drive my Edge everyday. It's fun to drive. The trunk space is also very generous and 2nd row seat is big enough for my 6' 5"" son. 18"" tire is a good idea, too.",4
727,"Switching from a Yukon, it has been hard getting used to being the little girl on the road again, but this is the car to do it with! I drive a lot and I am getting 30 mpg average! Sporty, no longer look like the soccer mom, and fun to drive. Couldn't be happier with my choice. Kids are 13 (big and tall) and 10 (short and sweet) and fit just fine. No road noise, no wind noise, very well built car and 4cyl has plenty of strength, this coming from an 8 cyl girl (for over 10 years)! I have the basic, no bluetooth, no nav... and dont miss it a bit.",3
728,"I just purchased a 2008 Hyundai Veracruz Limited FWD and drove from Texas to Kansas. This vehicle is very nice, and comes equipped better than a Lexus RX350. It also has a better warranty than the Lexus. The third row seat fold flat and is big enough for two adults. I was going to buy the Nissan Murano but the third row plus a better deal than an equivalently equipped Murano helped me choose the Veracruz. The exterior and interior fit and finish is very nice with tight tolerances. It's quiet at highway speeds, six speed automatic transmission with manual mode, and loaded with just about every convenience you could want. Power liftgate, leather heated seats, heated side mirrors, sunroof, etc",3
729,Overall - great car. I'm very pleased after almost buying an Acura and Saab. The Maxima has it all and more. Best thing - go for the leather - awesome seats and comfort. Performance - just test drive one and you'll see. Price is high although worth it when compared to others. BTW - The Audi A4 and Passat are both slugs compared to the Maxima.,4
730,"Picked up my G35 AWD in August 07, loaded with nav, rosewood and premium package. The power this car delivers is absolutely amazing!! You will get tempted to push it on the highway and other drivers seem to be tempting you to show them what you can do. You are getting a great product for the price. Very comfortable, responsive, and beautifully designed. A definite chick magnet too!! Just watch them stare as you zoom by.",4
731,"Overall, a very nice car with an air of high luxury. As for reliability, had a squealing noise which was a pulley bearing subject to recall. Dealer fixed with no hassle. We now have a strange rattle from the vicinity of the differential. Of course, it stopped when we took the car to the dealer and hasn't yet returned. Performance -- acceleration, braking, handling -- is just okay by my standards but I race cars, so I have high standards. This is primarily my wife's car. For the typical purchaser of this car, the performance is more than adequate. Not too happy about the high depreciation, but we plan on retaining the car for a while.",3
732,I owned a 78 CJ 5 and loved it. Have had trucks every since. All have been 4 wheel drive. My new Jeep has been a joy. Mileage hasnt been an issue since I have driven 4 wheel drive pickups so the 22 I am getting is a plus. Not a speed demon by any means but I am not into raceing. The thing will turn on a dime and handles great. Serves the purpose it was purchased for. It really does turn heads. Stereo is nice addition. Love the 3 peace top. Have had no leaks and wont have top on much in the summer. Heater doesnt keep up with the low single digit but its a Jeep. Will go anywhere.,4
733,"Purchased this SUV after driving an Infinity G-35x and missing the roominess from my previous SUV. Also, Hyundai was recommended by other friends who have one. Only issue so far is pulling to left. After two alignments, seems to be okay. Although steering is pretty sensitive. Like all the features, styling, performance (little sluggish in shifting between 1st & 2nd gear) so far, after 2000 miles. CD player is only 1 CD capacity?? If reliability holds up, seems like a very good vehicle for the price.",3
734,"This is an incredibly comfortable, quiet, and well thought-out car. Am averaging a little over 40 mpg, driving 60 - 80 mph on the highway about 70% of the time, with 20 to 40 mph city driving about 15% of the time, and stop and go big city traffic the remainder of the time. I find myself becoming increasingly obsessed with watching my driving habits, but still drive this like a normal car - I haven't become a complete hybrid geek... yet. With the tax credit (currently being phased out), the cost compares very well to similarly equipped gas Camry. Handling is good for this type of car, and exceeds expectations for a Camry (earlier Camry handling too soft for my liking). Try it!",4
735,"Great sedan at thousands less than Lexus. 32MPG hwy with loads of power. Nav could be a bit simpler to use both otherwise a well executed design and layout. This is my 2nd Avalon and a Lexus in sheep's clothes. Ultra quiet engine, loads of interior room and limo like back seat. Toyota did a super job on this often overlooked sedan.",4
736,"Just bought a Mazda6, went from a Acura TL 2004 to this but gas prices were killing me, I do miss the power of the TL's V6 but this Mazda6 is really good looking and gives me a very decent mileage. I love the black on black combination. I was surprised at the quality of the cloth material used in the seats. I compared to the Camry and even though the Camry its bigger with a more powerful engine and better gas mileage the pricing factor makes the Mazda a better deal, I bought mine for 16,200 and it comes with 6 discs cd changer, 17 inches rims with michelin tires, dual exhaust system, well it is pretty loaded and for 16,200 WOW!!",3
737,"I purchased my 2008 Avenger in April 2008. I am very disappointed with it. I have 12,478 miles on it. Brakes grind, door and side pannels creek like crazy...cant find that problem to fix, Im on my 4th mygig radio(Keeps Freezing up). Sluggish tranny(4cyl). Front noises when you turn or go over a bump. AC doesnt work well, numerous blind spots, chrome plasic around shifter inside blinds driver, poorly designed trunk pours water into the trunk when wet and many many more just running out of room. PLEASE DO NOT BUY ONE.JUNK This is just the worst car I have ever owned. Back in 1997 I had a brand new avenger and loved it so I thought I would take a chance with the 2008. What a mistake.",0
738,"We also looked at MDX, CX-9 and Veracruz. Nothing compares to Enclave. We were attracted to the stylish exterior initially but we were surprised to see how good the build quality was. This is the best bargain in the market if you are looking to get a quality SUV/CUV. We have the White Diamond which they no longer produce. Worth a 12 weeks wait.",4
739,"My smart for two was a demo car and had 3500 miles on it when I purchased it. I now have 6500 miles on it. The car is a blast to drive, I like to get on the interstate highway and pass cars and trucks going 75 miles per hour, they look like they cannot believe this smart car can go that fast and have the power that it does. What is neat is the car will go over 80 miles per hour in 4th gear, ha. I would like Cruise control on the car and arm rests on the seats. And I will probably have Cruise control installed. So far, I love the smart car and am thinking about purchasing another one for my wife. People are very inquisitave about this car and like it, but don't like the 1 year wait.",4
740,"This is one great car for the money! Rides and drives great with comfortable seating. I had read these reviews before purchasing and having driven and owning this vehicle, I agree that there is a good bit of road noise, but all of the small cars in this price range did as well. Real world driving all around has resulted in 26 MPG with straight HWY MPG at 28 which could be better. Another thing about some of the reviews at this site state that this car doesn't ride, drive, and handle as well as their Accord or one are Camry, nor is as quiet, the last time I checked, these cars are thousands more in price than the Caliber but none have a higher safety rating. Apples to Apples this is a great c",4
741,"I loved driving my used 2001 Limited Edition PT Crusier but was having some problems with it come 2007 so I decided it was time for a new one..despite the previous problems I had, I figured buying a brand new one I wouldn't have any problems, so I purchased a brand new Cruiser on January 1, 2008. Do you think it's been a joy? Not one bit! I have had nothing but problems since day one! It has been in for balancing over 3 times, the tires have been indexed multiple times, and now it squeaks when I go over anything that makes the car bouce. It's so annoying! Body creaks shouldn't be happening on a less then one year old car! I am over my car and will never buy a Chrysler again!",0
742,"This car is a blast to drive! I feel like I'm in a sports car. I'm 5'9 and fit in with no trouble, as it is so roomy. I love the thumbs up, gawking, crowds I draw, and the oohs, and aahs. I've even had people pull in my driveway to have a look. The shifting takes a little getting used to but what fun!! Ever since I saw these cars in Europe I've wanted one. Best of all it is so easy to find a parking space!",4
743,"We just bought our Equinox a day before going on vacation. We put over 3000 miles in 12 days. Drove from Houston Tx to Michigan then to Niagra Falls and then down thru Penn, Tenn, Vir, W. Vir, Miss, Al, LA and back to Texas. MPG was great! Averaged at 26mpg. Ride was not a Cadillac but comfortable. All in all this is a great SUV.",4
744,"I love this car! Every time I pull up to the valet, everyone always comments on my super black, fully loaded coupe! The gas mileage is fantastic. I never get tired of the push-button ignition. Nissan doesn't advertise this model too often, so when people see they are very surprised. A great 50k car for under 30k!",4
745,I purchased this car a year ago and have been extremely unhappy with the performance in the winter. If it snows less or more than an inch of snow the car will not move it does nothing but spin. It also was parked on a lawn and had to be towed out for it would only spin up mud and not move. I have brand new all season radial on this car and still it cant get out of its own way. The rack that is provided by the factory is terrible I am scared to put my kayaks on them for fear that the rack is to weak & it will break under the pressure. It also does not go wide enough to accomodate the length of the kayaks. Over all this vehicle is to light for the maine winters and I have been very unhappy.,0
746,"This is my fourth Chevy truck (2 Silverados, 1 Tahoe previously). They just keep getting better. I have never had any problems with any of them. The Suburban is by far the best. I have the Z71 package and love it. It is great for our large family either around town or on longer trips. Now if I can just get my wife to get one. (She is still not confident driving such a large vehicle.) If you need a large SUV, this is a great one.",4
747,"When you buy a C 300,or a 328, or A4, you're buying a good German engineered automobile that delivers sporty and capable driving dynamics without being a performance car, enough features to please most drivers but no luxury amenities (unless you add optionals that will shoot up the price), and comprehensive maintenance/service (every 10k miles or so). It's a very good car that makes me look forward to the E550 or E63 AMG.",3
748,Bought car 3 months ago and I've had it in for service 5 times in the last month and a half for a squealing problem it makes when I first turn it on in the morning. Very unhappy with the dealership and service techs at van dyn hoven for not fixing what seems like a simple problem and offering a loaner vehicle. Gas mileage is less than 20 mpg's. Sunglasses holder to small and doesn't fit glasses. Fuel door broke off already when my husband bumped it with his arm when putting fuel in. Made of cheap plastic. Headrest and armrest are also awkward for me.,1
749,The 350Z has all it takes to be an excellent peformance and economical sports car! The handling and pickup is great! The gas miles is great! The look and feel is great! The cost is great! Basically you feel great all around in the 350Z AWESOME street machine! I wouldn't trade it for a Porsche or anything else. If the standard 350Z isn't good enough for you get a 370Z or NISMO. If you want another mint vehicle try the Nissan GTR or Skyline GTR which also in and of itelf can take most every vehicle on or on/off road and put them to shame! Once you try a 350Z or any of the other Nissan power machines you won't want anything else.,4
750,"This car is fun to drive, gets great gas mileage, and is by far the safest car i have ever owned (which has become very important to me with a new baby!). I have owned both Mercedes and BMW's in the recent past, and this car is more exciting, and has more cool features than either one of those! there is this thing call the BLIS (blind spot information system) that tells you if someone is in your blind with a light on the front A pillar... Very cool, and useful!",4
751,"I drive my car everyday. City mileage I get about 24.4 and city averaging 35.5 doing 70 mph. I like how the car just with the tap of the throttle likes to take off. It has great handling, very little under/over steer. The ESP option is great for dirt and gravel roads, helps with sticking to the road. Since New Years Eve of 2008 I have put al ot of miles on the car. It has held up with no problem and does extremely well on the highway. Gas mileage isn't what I'm used to from my last car I owned. Yet the car gets compliments often and will be with me for a long time.",3
752,"I've had my Compass for about a month. With all of the features that my 4x4 Limited has, it is a great value. I would have had to spend another five to seven thousand dollars to get a Honda or Toyota similarly equipped. Fun to drive, economical, and the darker colors are not bad looking in my opinion.",3
753,"Had my sedan for a year. It's my second BMW. The first was a 2002 325i. There is no comparison. I am not sure why I bought a second BMW, since my 325 was below average in reliability. My 2008 has been a pleasant surprise. Not one problem and it really does handle and drive light years better than the 325i. I tested the Audis and G35s but there really was no comparison. And now that gas prices are falling it's even better! No thanks to the hybrids.",3
754,I purchased this Yaris 2 doors liftback for a restaurant delivery use. So far fuel consumption is not what Toyota states between 34-39. Mine is average 19 MPG. It's half of what it states. This is the only thing I feel bad about it.,2
755,"I bought my LX Sedan about a month ago and really like it. I put a pair of wrist (sweat) bands around the emergency brake. The brake hurt my leg due to its placement but now it's fine with the pad. I live in a very cold environment which kills MPG but I am getting 30 MPG Combined City/Hwy. The motor is new, and I'm sure MPG will improve when it's breken in and the weather warms up. It has plenty of power, I have owned vettes and trans ams, and I'm happy with the acceleration of my new Honda. It's not noisy on the highway like some have reported. It is a small car and you do hear the road a little, and you feel all the bumps, but as I pass the gas stations ($3.39 a gallon) I am smiling!",3
756,"To sum it up, this is our second RX. Our first was the 2004 RX 330. However, my wife always liked the Bamboo Pearl color, so when the timing was right, we purchased a 2008 RX 350 in that color. Overall, the vehicles are the same. But I will say the changes made from 2004 to 2008 were needed; performance is better, tighter, and overall a real pleasure. The vehicle is now 3 months old and my wife constantly reminds me of how much she LOVES her new car.",3
757,"I thought this would have been the car for me after all the problems with the stratus. Boy! first thing brakes @ 15 mnths. 2nd, Stuck in park, 3rd battery died, computer had to be reset after vehicle was lazy in going. Car squeaks a lot. But, I love how it just go when the need arise.",2
758,"I got this for the family and work. Got it with all the bells and whistles. Love the Red Rock leather. Comfortable ride. Not bad gas usage for a V8. Very comfortable ride with a vehicle height adjustment for when stopped and loading/unloading. Acceleration a little slow but manual option allows for better acceleration control. Looked at Escalade, Yukon, Mercedes Benz and decided this was best bang for the buck. Also, handling/steering seems better and quality is good. Interior better looking than the GM cars. Also, back seats automatic and fold flat, unlike the GM cars. Storage minimal when using all 7/8 passengers but most SUV's like that. Perfect for 4 person family.",4
759,"I use my Ridgeland off road a good amount. I regularly smell burning grass after drivng down dirt roads with grass growing in the middle. I have had a serious fire in the engine compartment which caused over $5,000 of damage. I have had one other small fire which I put out with a garden hose. There is a connection around the exhaust pipe that catches grass and leaves which smolder and/or catch fire. You may remember the Honda ads during the last March Madness showing a ""herd"" of Ridgelines crossing a field of tall grasses. That was a brush fire in the making. This pickup is safe in the mall parking lot, but don't go near the grass. Honda has been unresponsive.",1
760,"I have always been a Chevy lover, but have recently owned a Ford. I research every big purchase to death. Once I sat in the car, I fell in love with it. This is coming from a guy used to driving pickups. It gets great feul milage and is very confortable for long trips. It is extremly quiet. I get comments all the time on it.",4
761,"I think this van is great. I always told myself that I would never get a minivan, but with kids it's a must. I think its the best looking minivan on the market, both inside and out. So far I haven't had any of the problems that some have complained about like excessive road noise or squeaking. This van has tons of room and the backup camera is awesome. It drives just like my accord which makes driving it much easier for my wife. Out of all the vans I researched, this had the highest rating and now I see why.",4
762,"No complaints about this car, a real value. I read some of the reviews about sluggish performance...not so! Lots of zip. Great MPG. Front drivers seat position a tad tight at times, but comfortable.",3
763,"Had to replace my Ford Explorer after a drunk driver took it out. Was going to downsize to a Rav-4 6 cylinder. Compared Highlander and was sold on it. For basically the same cost got much more. 2 row seating comes with many options, converts to bench type seating, can have a table in between the seats or converts to captain's seats. Kids love their seating area.",3
764,"My Corolla drives great, I made a great choice in buying one. I plan to keep it as long as it will last, I have a feeling that will be a long time. Toyota does not play around when building their vehicles. Everything seems to be tuned to perfection.",4
765,"I purchased this car to make up for all of the emmissions I was spewing from my 1997 Saab. I thought the design and handling of the car were great. It did have a lot of road noise, but the gas mileage - 37- 42 mpg makes up for it. The only complaint I have is the fit and finish. I have been to the dealer 3 times already with interior replacement issues. So far I have had to replace one broken sun visor, a door panel(rattles), and a seat frame (rattles). Unfortunately, a new noise/rattle pops up every day, depending on the temperature and conditions. I was hoping for a better fit & finish for a $19,000 vehicle.",2
766,"After several very positive experiences with Toyota, I came up with a downer. Quite evident, the more Toyota grows, the more it has taken some quality control out of there vehicles. I have 6k miles on mine and have an off and on noise that happens at 75-80 (dealer can't diagnose 'cause they can only drive it up to 70), front dash rattles, passenger door rattles and has had to be towed as it wouldn't start (Thank God I purchased the extended service plan otherwise I would have been really irked paying for towing on a 3 month old truck). I wouldn't mind a littler better mileage but it's not bad. Power is good for a V6 and comfort is good as well. I still like it but wish it were better.",1
767,"This is my fourth VW, but my First Convertible. Have had three Jetta's before this and the last was A GLI with all the toys. But I have never had as much fun driving as I do now. The roof is great and their is very little to no wind noise. I love having the security of a hard top on a convertible. Foe the Base model with auto I really think it has a lot of options. Like I was told when i bought my first VW. The only problem is you have to replace it with another.",3
768,"Drove Silverados for ten years. Last new was a 1998 with 128,000 plus miles combination city and highway. Was in excellent shape when I gave it to my daughter and bought the Double Cab SR5 with big V8. Tundra handled a lot tighter than Ford or Chevrolet with less effort. Ride is smooth on and off road. Comfortable in front seats and back according to my 6'4"" son-in law. Still in break in period with 1500 miles on it. Driving 70 to 75 MPH with air conditioner on and cruise set I average 19.8 MPG highway and city is 15.3 with air conditioner on. I do avoid stop and go traffic as much as possible which has helped the gas mileage a lot. Better gas mileage than my 1998 Silverado.",3
769,"I traded in my BMW X3 for the Cooper S. I got so much more than fuel efficiency, which was my initial goal. I totally pimped it out! It is a joy to drive and it is solid! I was amazed at how well it is built and how solid it feels. BMW got it right! The turbo is quick, seamless and no turbo lag. The sound system is killer. The ""bun warmer"" seats are toasty on those chilly Colorado evenings when I like to drive with the ""way cool"" double moonroof opened to the max. The styling makes me smile when I drive it and others smile when I cruise by. It corners like a dream. My husband is 6'4"" and loves this car. He has a brand new BMW 328XI and I can't get him to leave my MINI alone!",4
770,"I've had my NAH for 3 months, and I'm loving it. I drove an Acura TSX before, and the Altima is not as much fun, but it has plenty of pep and compelling driving dynamics. I'm pleased with an average of 34-35 MPG, but I am driving like Grandma to get those numbers. It's loaded except for navi: heated leather, Bose stereo, blueto. This car is a lot prettier than a Prius and is more fun to drive than the Camry Hybrid. The interior layout is excellent: controls are easy to read and to reach, and everything feels carefully designed. The modest rumble that you feel/hear when the gasoline engine kicks in does not bother me at all (some folks seem to mind). All in all - great car!",3
771,"Best vehicle I have ever owned. Rides smooth and the interior never fails to impress. AWD is superior and the build quality is second to none. For the price the Lexus and Acura can't touch the B9. So far two friends about to buy Pilots, even had deals together, bought B9s after test driving them at my suggestion. It certainly is worth a look for anyone in the luxury or near luxury SUV market.",4
772,"535i Sapphire Black/Black with Sport & Premium. Simply awesome. Very well built, comfortable, fun to drive, quiet inside and bloody fast. Test drove an A6 3.2 Quattro and an E350 Sport. The Audi was really nice but felt a little underpowered (after driving the 535i). The E350 is a great passenger's car, not that great a driver's car.",3
773,X3 2007 is nearly perfect with its new engine and transmission and improved interior. It is the best vehicle I have ever owned and I have been driving new mercedes since 1993.,4
774,"Kia hit the nail on the head by creating a vehicle that's got the footprint of a compact but can handle 7 passengers, or 5 and a bunch of stuff. I chose the Rondo over a fwd RAV4, and saved about $5K. Very well put-together and drives well, but feels somewhat like an appliance. Not a lot of soul in the driving experience. But performs better than average where it counts: space, safety, economy, value, features.",3
775,"I am stationed in Japan and we have a 2006 Madza 5 (Premacy in Japan). This is far one of the best vehicle for a family of 4. This is a very popular vehicle in Japan, not to big and not to small. Has all the right features with an affordable price tag. We love our Premacy so much that we decided to purchase a new 08 Mazda5 Touring from great dealer in Illinois. It will be ready for pick up upon our arrival. We can't wait to drive our new and improved Mazda5.",4
776,"Reliable truck so far, Made trip to Orlando from Dallas without any problems. Acceleration and gas mileage are only negatives so far. Reliability, ride, comfort and functionality are all pluses.",3
777,"I had never considered a Mitsubishi until I was looking online at Edmunds and read the other reviews on the Outlander. I wanted a crossover but did not like the CR-V despite the fact that i've owned 3 Hondas before this vehicle. I love my Mitsubishi Outlander SE FWD. I have just over 1,100 miles on it already and we love it!",4
778,"Traded up from a Sentra SE-R. Although much bigger, the Altima Coupe 3.5SE has more power and a luxyury-car like interior with the premium pkg. I'm getting almost the same gas mileage as the Sentra, too! Handling is softer but the A/C is a great value for what you get.",3
779,"I have had my R32 for 4 days now. I had previously owned a 1995 Jetta VR6. I knew what to expect with the power and performance. However I had no idea how smooth and precise the DSG was until my First Road Trip - from Detroit to Atlanta (750 miles). I learned that ""S"" means See Ya later! I was comfortable and enjoy the drive. Unbelievable handling and acceleration! This vehicle is low key and stays under the ""Radar"" with police. I look forward to adding a Cool Air Intake in the coming weeks to help with gas mileage and possibly more.",4
780,"After doing extensive research before I decided to purchase the Rogue, I found that the Rogue costs less, has more room, has a better engine, looks better, and has better fuel economy than other cars in its class such as the Honda CRV. After test driving both cars, it was very clear to me that the Rogue was much more superior than the CRV in almost every category you can think of. I am very happy with my purchase!",4
781,"Purchased a 08 HHR SS and have been enjoying it. Even with the high performance turbo charged engine, I get decent gas mileage. Of course using the various readouts and the cruise control helps too. Of course there are some minor things that I don't like. But at least the window controls are back where they should be on the SS. Having to go through two tire changes when a flat occurs on one of the front tires will be a real big pain. But I have roadside service. I rented a HHR for a week a few months before. So I could see if I liked driving it. I did and waited for the SS model to come out. I got the victory red and have got several comments on the HHR. So far I like the HHR I have.",3
782,"Incredible acceleration. Good engine sound, handles like a big go cart. Nice interior. By far, the quickest car I've ever driven, and I've driven some fast ones. Reminds me of the song, ""The Best is Yet to Come-...you think you've flown before, but babe, you ain't left the ground.""",3
783,"I've always been a skeptic about the performance of our Toyota Sequoia, but after a recent car accident I can't imagine a safer car. My sister recently endured a traumatic car crash with our Sequoia flying 10 feet in the air and flipping three times and she came out shaken but nearly unscathed. The Toyota Sequoia is built like a tank and guarantees both the satisfaction of a SUV and a safe vehicle. It's quite literally a life saver.",3
784,"Wanting to buy the 07 LS 460, but ended buying the GS 350, but no regret this car is super refine, fast and powerful. Researched all competitors. This GS is better hands down if you're looking for power,luxury, comfort and refinement. Has everything that I need in a car from power to comfort and safety features.",4
785,A pleasant surprise i have an automatic XR handles better ont he corners that my 2003 mitsubishi eclipse gt --- what? i know i could not beleive it either,4
786,"Great car for the money. The upgraded interior and exterior in the S package was worth the extra money. My car gets a lot of looks especially with the 18'' wheels. I was getting 38 mpg with the stock wheels, after the 18'' wheels were installed the car dropped to 33 mpg. I am ok with the difference because i was driving a 97 4x4 4runner that was getting 16mpg before the Yaris.",3
787,"We bought the FX 35 about three weeks ago. Moving from a Jeep Grand Cherokee, which we thought handled sort of like a car, is like moving from a bicycle to a Harley. The FX is nimble, sporty and quick. You can really feel the road yet the seats are super comfortable. The interior is nicely appointed and the steering wheel controls are great. My wife has a hard time seeing out of the GC and she loves the way this car drives. We are very pleased.",4
788,"I wanted something fun, but not one of the Racer Boy cars. I have kids, but I'm more likely to be alone and take the wife's VW Passat with the family. This car just FIT. Excellent fuel economy, power when you want it, and space to take things. Can even tow or mount stuff on the roof if needed. Interior is very unique. Some buttons take some getting used to, but overall a really nice stylish design. I like the two rear seats as they didn't try to squeeze in 3. Access with manual seats is great. Comfort is good as long as you put the short people in back. Volvo seats just seem to fit really nice for the long haul. Even the carpet in the back doesn't seem to be a dog hair magnet.",4
789,"I have only had the Civic for a week but I love it. I had been looking for a couple months and finally picked Civic. It's much quicker than I expected. This car drives great! The coupe may be a little tricky to get into for larger adults and the rear seat is out of the question for most adults. But almost everything else is great! The two tier dash board has grown on me, although I didn't care for it at first (too space ship). The car looks great. I have had loads of compliments. One lady said she thought it was an Acura. I've driven many different cars but the main reason for going with the Civic is the reliability. I expect this car to run great for many years to come.",3
790,"The rear Differential broke 2 times within 2 weeks and 700 miles on the car! The power steering is jittery, They also installed the ski rack on wrong and The bike rack is too high on the car to even put a bike up there. This car is nothing but problems and poor design. Also the extended warranty has about 3 pages of what it doesn't cover, and only 1 paragraph of what it does cover and maybe when you will use the $1000 dollar warranty, it may cover a radio now if you're lucky.. When I got my car back from the dealer it seems like the 4wd doesn't even work.",0
791,"Since day one I am having transmission problems. The dealer keeps on saying there is nothing wrong with the vehicle, but there is. It slows down too quickly when your foot is removed from the gas pedal. Sooner or later I will be rear-ended. I am in arbitration now. I was told by a Toyota the tech to drive aggressively. That is against the law. As of now I am due for an arbitration hearing.",1
792,I drive close to 40K miles a year and used to go to the pump every other day. I rarely go to the pump anymore since I got the Prius. My wife and I drive it on the weekend all the time since her car takes a lot of gas (compared to a Prius). We both love it!,4
793,I bought a 2008 Dodge Caliber last October within a month of purchasing it I had it in the shop. The transmission is horrible. Anytime I got to stop or start it jolts and spudders like it is about to stall. Called Dodge apparently some Calibers have this problem others do not. Also they said there is no fix! Than went back to have front struts replaced and to look and trans again and again no fix! Now the problem seems to happen when in reverse. I'm really not happy with this vehicle.,1
794,"I love this car. I think that the best way to describe just how great this car is to tell you what my dad said. He just bought the new Lexus sports car and he says that if he could do it all over again he would have gotten the 08 Altima Coupe because it drives almost as well and looks sharper on the outside, is more comfortable, and when you factor in that it is half the price it's a no brainer.",4
795,"This is the best vehicle we have ever owned, or driven. It is exceptionally comfortable, and a joy to ride in. The quietest vehicle in my experience of 50 years of driving. Some pseudo sophisticates gripe about the fake wood. Of course it is fake, but it is beautiful and adds to the excellent interior design. Get over yourselves. A friend, and MDX owner, is green with jealousy.",4
796,"I traded my comfortable truck for fuel economy and was worried that I'd be compromising too much, but I have been pleasantly surprised. Nothing else in this car class comes close for the money. Saving on the car payment is just an added bonus. For $20k the Civic serves up great styling, impeccable fit and finish, good handling and a fun driving experience. The dash is easy to read without taking your eyes off the road. I routinely get 30 mpg. The powertrain is smooth for cruising and pleasing to push when you have to, or want to, and it's sporty enough that you'll want to. This is the car other manufacturers could learn from. This is simply a better car with fewer toys and more substance.",4
797,"I am pleasantly surprised with this fleet vehicle. The efficiency, space, practicality, and good features really work well. An all-day interstate blitz immediately after delivery was a real pleasure. The visibility to the front is great and satisfactory elsewhere. I enjoyed operating the speed control from the steering wheel, and the speedometer is dead accurate according to my GPS. At great velocity, engine and wind noise are nearly non- existent and mileage is respectable. There are door pockets in each door, a glove box, console storage, a map pocket in the passenger seat, and a cargo net in the trunk. This vehicle is a great value.",4
798,"I became a believer after I drove my niece's Prius! This one is a keeper - it sets the gold standard in technology, economy and technology, and challenges other carmakers to compete! It offered more than what I expected. I am averaging 51 MPG in suburban driving. The car engages you constantly, and actually encourages prudent driving. I have scored one convert so far - my houseguest last night! Get the Touring Model - the heftier wheels, suspension, stability control and back-up camera are well worth the extra grand.",4
799,"Wow...what a rush. That about sums it up. Great road feel--not too harsh of a ride (compared to other ""sport-y"" cars this fast) and quiet for this car segment--much quieter than my '01 Protégé. Interior features are very well thought out. I have the Touring, so the extra features like auto wipers and lights are wonderful--and make me almost think I'm in a more expensive car. The red stitching has been approved by everyone from 60 years old down to 10--good going Mazda on that feature. Torque steer is only noticeable when turning sharply in 1st and 2nd gear, after that it?s only a slight nudge that simply gives you a smile as you remember how much fun it is to lay on the lead foot.",4
800,"Switched to Highlander from Lexus RX 330. Pleased with the design and drivability - comfort is excellent as I am 6 ft, 3 in. Very much like the smart key system and the functionality. Very displeased with the electronics. Satellite radio requires a very expensive and labor intensive installation - I obviously didn't read carefully enough or I would have likely purchased a different vehicle. In order to install satellite radio the dealer indicates that the headliner has to be removed - even a seat removed. WHAT WAS TOYOTA THINKING? The GPS mapping system lacks detail - I live in a city of 40,000 and most of the side streets aren't noted. GPS service on my cell phone is more detailed.",3
801,"Loving it. Mine is Silver Birch with a rear spoiler, power moonroof and nice tint. I have had mine for a week now. I test drove this 4 times to make sure I was not hallucinating. The power of the dohc v6 is excellent. I would have bought the 4 cylinder if the deal would not have worked out on the v6. The styling is strong, distinguished, classy, understated, smart and masculine with ""man-grille"" up front anchoring this good handling ride resting on sweet styled 17"" alloys. Handling is great for this segment. Fit and finish makes this easily the best Ford sedan ever. It is the ""poor mans"" CTS and does have Caddy drivers looking.",4
802,"Just bought the Highlander Limited after a 4 month search of various SUVs. This car is awesome! Lots of space, optional captain's chairs in the backseat as well as heat & a/c, backup camera, keyless ignition, and so many more extras. The powerful engine and 270hp helps make the ride very smooth, and fast. The Blizzard Pearl color w/gray interior was hard to find, but so worth it. Car has more features than the Lexus RX 350, and Toyota reliability is a given. I looked at both luxury and mid-range SUVs, and the Highlander was absolutely the best of the bunch.",4
803,Love it. Comfortable and very fun to drive. The 306 HP really makes this car move. Nav package is a must.,4
804,"Our family has had this vehicle for two weeks and it is spectacular. My wife is the primary driver and she loves it. I've gotta think that some Americans (Chrysler influence?) were involved in the design parameters because the Germans finally nailed what an SUV should be. This chameleon is amazingly user friendly and provides everything you could want in a large SUV but somehow feels diminutive from behind the wheel. The interior is truly something to behold. Stitched leather, gorgeous wood accents, and appealing angles abound. A++",4
805,"The Saturn Sky is a fun car to drive! It gets excellent gas mileage. Sound system is good. This is my first convertible, and I love it.",4
806,"I get 41 MPG in the city very consistently. I have gotten as high as 43 MPG on the highway. I suppose you could get 50 MPG if you were going down hill all of the time and didn?t run the A/C. I live in Houston, TX, so that isn?t very practical. I?m happy with the 41 MPG. This car qualifies as an Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emissions vehicle in all 50 states. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gives the Civic Hybrid a greenhouse gas score of 10 (being the best). The car qualifies for a $1,350 tax credit. The Honda Civic Hybrid was declared the World Green Car for 2006 at the New York International Auto Show.",3
807,"Traded in a 2002 Tundra that I never had a problem with. The 2007 has all the little things that I wished for on my 2002. Ride is great but stiffer than the older one, which I like, but I do have the off road suspension which makes it slightly stiffer. Get all kinds of looks and thumbs up on the road. Interior comfortable and easy to operate controls. It is definitely full size and the 5.7 is sooooo much fun to drive even when you are not towing.",3
808,"This is our third Corolla. Wife had a 2003, daughter has a 2005. When my wife's HHR was totaled she wanted to return to a Corolla as long as it had side air bags. Driving my Jeep was a bit scary for her. We got the LE model with power windows, wooden like interior trim and cruise control. It sets the standard for all compact economy vehicles. Excellent mileage, smooth ride, roomy interior and a huge trunk. Perfect for city driving and for long trips for two adults and a maximum of two preteens. Well put together and indicative of Toyota's pursuit of quality even in an economy vehicle. A great bargain.",4
809,I used to buy Nissans and Hondas for all these years. I am very happy with the decision that I made to buy a Cadillac CTS. It is just excellent.,4
810,"This car is great! I drive 100 miles a day mostly highway and have been getting 35+ mpg. Very fun to drive, with a well thought out interior. Handles very well.",4
811,I just purchased this car and so far I love everything about it. It has an interior that feels roomy and not cheap looking. It drives smoothly and seems to have plenty of power for what my needs are. I love the little extras.,4
812,"I bought my 07 CRV in May 2008. People have stopped me at gas stations and grocery stores to ask me about my car! It is comfortable, reliable, and fun to drive. My last car was a Chevy Tracker with 4 cylinders so I was skeptical to get another 4 cylinder, but once I drove it, I noticed a huge difference. The tracker was like trying to push an elephant up a hill. The CR-V isn't like that. It doesn't zip onto the highway like a corvette, but it can get the job done with no problem and sure doesn't feel like an elephant. I love it and it's the best purchase I've ever made.",4
813,"I purchased this car used from a dealership, with 32k miles on it. I also own a 2005 Malibu sedan. I immediately noticed a clunking sound coming from the steering column when turning the wheel at low speeds. This is a sound I also noticed in my 2005 Malibu. I took it back to the dealer and they had to lubricate the intermediate shaft in the steering column. The shades to the sunroof also broke, so they ordered new ones for me as well. The car is comfortable, rides well and has good acceleration with the 3.5 liter V6. I don't understand how some people here are getting 29 mpg however, because I am getting about 18 mpg in mostly city driving. Disappointing mileage.",2
814,"Bought my 08 this month. There were only 2 left on the lot and this one had all the extras. Love it. Love it. Love it. Best SUV for the money and I haven't found a flaw yet - other than the gas mileage, but I knew how bad that was going in and was willing to make the sacrifice. It wasn't any better than the compact 05 SUV I was driving, but it was certainly better than some of the other full size models I was shopping for.",3
815,"I really like this car. Quiet, comfortable, and cruises the highway exceedingly well. (Just 2000 RPM at 78 mph) Road noise is very low. Previously driven Chevy Impalas and this Taurus is clearly well above it in style, fit, and finish. I've been trying to stay with an American brand sedan. This car is definitely worth a look and a test drive. I ordered the SEL with leather option, and upgraded radio package.",3
816,"I bought the car when changing positions to sales from engineering. I work for a company that builds light-weight campers and I needed something that would pull up to 3500#. The Equinox does a great job and my gas mileage is very impressive. It is a great looking vehicle with somewhat futuristic looks and it compliments the unusual campers we build. Without having any trailering experience to speak of, I have successfully navigated over 10,000 miles with ease. On one of my trips I left 11:30 at night in a storm with 2"" of snow already on the ground while towing a 1600# camper. The traction control was awesome even through the winding mountainous back roads of Western Pennsylvania.",3
817,"The car can be summed up in one phrase: performance and luxury in a compact design. I drove a 2003 and 2005 3.0L A4 prior to getting this one and the performance stands up well. There is definitely noticeable turbo lag, but this can probably be overcome by changing driving habits. The sound of the engine will also take some getting used to as the turbo is a bit ""throatier"" than I'm used to. The car handles extremely well, though, hugging curves and accelerating very smoothly. The now-standard S-Line exterior features definitely give the car a sportier look. The interior is outstanding. The layout is getting better and the list of available features is exhaustive. In all, a great car!",4
818,"This is my 6th Vette including 3 C6s in the last 2 years. My Vettes have always been my daily driver. I have owned Porches, Infinity, Lincoln, Cadillac and other find automobiles during my forty plus years of car ownership. This is the most exciting auto experience of all my dealings. The performance is unbelievable. The reliably of my last four Vettes has been perfect with absolutely not one warranty issue and zero for this one now in it's second month and 2200 miles. A perfect and most rewarding experience!",4
819,"Smooth ride, power to spare, comfortable to drive and ride, and great features. All that for a couple thousand less than the market leaders. Buy one this year or the next - I expect Hyundai will get popular and raise their prices accordingly. Gets reasonable gas mileage if you lay off the gas pedal. Only tip - check the tire pressure after you get your vehicle, one of mine was low. RG",3
820,"This is an excellent little car. I waited nearly 5 months to ge it and it was worth it. It's fun to drive, gets great mileage and cuts through heavy traffic. I've driven on twisty roads and had a blast. Lots of room, solid build quality, great handling, great mileage. In Europe it's called a Jazz. Should have stuck with that name.",4
821,"First of all it is the 4 cyl/SE model so it looks great, (I was driving an Infiniti fx35 before this and was never so happy to spend 50 bucks less a week on gas). I have 2000 miles on it so far and it is more quiet than the fx, more roomy (it is hard to believe but the fx is small inside) better features, 2 perfectly placed car adapters. 17 inch rims make ride a bit higher so I am not hitting curbs when parking. I never wanted to buy a camry before, they looked like your parents car, now they look like MY racing car.",4
822,"Even though the Touring Prius is rated at 42 MPG we get several more MPG on average all the time. Our current average MPG is 45. The hatchback design is perfect for us. My handicap folding mobility scooter fits in the left side of the hatch perfectly. We find the Prius very comfortable on trips, even with 4 adults in the vehicle.",3
823,We purchased our car used in New Orleans with 7900 miles on it. We flew to New Orleans from Wa State to pick it up and drive it back home. We put 4K miles on the car in 2 weeks. We had to pack light but were able to get enough shorts and tops in it to make the trip. We averaged 31.6 MPG over the 4000 miles. We had no problems with the car or our backs and legs on the trip. The hard top helped with the noise as it was up most of the time on the freeways. I had read reviews about squeaks with the top and as soon as we drove off the lot I heard the same thing. Mazda in Wa. was able to fix with foam tape in the two receptors for the top at the top sides of windshield. Lots of Zoom Zoom!!,3
824,"We bought the car this weekend in PHX/AZ and drove it 450-miles to ABQ/NM in the most beautiful and awful weather you could have in April. We had the top down and flew thru the AZ mountains, passing 2 Mustangs and 1 Vette that wanted to know more about the Sky. It hung curves and took off into the straights. V6/8's kill you in long straits, but who cares. This car is fun, head turning, and stacked in the handling dept. We had hard/high winds, rain and sleet that the interior handled well. Top is easy to put down for the money. Buy for a 2nd car or if you do not need a trunk. Love the car, but know your space needs. Highs outweigh lows, so far.",3
825,"I would recommend this car - for the money that you pay it's the best. It's not something I would try to make fast, it's a four cylinder. It's reliable and has just enough HP to get it done.",3
826,No problems so far in five months of light driving.,3
827,So far so good. Lots of features. Great driving experience. Safe and reliable. very stylish. great appeal with design. good performance. Nice brakes. Attractive wheels and excellent traction with Goodyear tires. Handles well in mountain driving as well as freeway. Probably the best car I've owned in 30 years. The SS Chevy is a great value and every one likes the car who see it when I'm parking the vehicle. Lots of extras for an American revolution! Go check the car out for yourself. The vehicle sells itself! Thanks General Motors I like the car!,3
828,"I have owned several SUVs and this one is by far better than any of them. Very comfortable to drive and very quiet on the highway. I bought this Jeep for its gas mileage, so far not as good as I hoped for but it only has 600 miles on it. A few things I don't understand is why it didn't come with cruise control? 6 disk CD and Sirius satellite but no cruise. Jeep needs to rethink there power packages. Also why no aux outlet for the more expensive radio? So far I love this Jeep!",4
829,"For all who have the SRT8 or buy something similar, Performance & Styling must be the first thing on your mind. It can't be, or shouldn't be, gas mileage, comfort, or even reliability. Sports cars, or in this case, Muscle Cars, are a breed all to themselves. They can't be huddled with the rest of the pack. They are specialty built and because of that, stand alone. This Charger SRT8 is what Dodge set it out to be. Cool looking, fast, fun and exhilarating to drive?not to mention an attention getter. It hits the mark in those areas 100% The sound of the V8 is balanced and perfect. I can?t say enough good things about it. Buy this car if you?re in the market.",4
830,"We loved our Enclave before taking a 5400 mile road trip with 4 adults plus luggage, but now we wouldn't part with it for any vehicle on the road. For 5400 miles we averaged 20.2 miles per gallon, which we were really happy about since the vehicle was loaded. We drove through the Pennsylvania hills and the car performed beautifully - not a sign of the transmission hesitancy some people grouse about. The ride was superb, the carrying capacity was more than adequate, and the interior arrangement was really handy for all of the things we took.",4
831,"This is my first new car after graduating college. Before this I drove a 2002 E46 330i on occasion, but my own car was a 1986 BMW 635CSi. As a BMW gearhead, I never saw myself in a Volvo, but the car represents an excellent value. There is a lot of performance (I have 5-sp manual), style, comfort, and feature content for the money. I have similar features as a BMW 328i for $10k less, and I actually enjoy the unique style, as a 3-series are a dime a dozen today. The ride is very smooth while still delivering road-hugging performance. As my first front-wheel-drive car, I appreciate the all-weather abilities as well.",3
832,"This vehicle does it all. We can get 7 full size adults and teens in this vehicle; it is very well ventilated, creature comforts galore, drive is smooth and steering so easy, great acceleration. Never feels like a big car when you're driving. It's the ultimate trip and town vehicle, a true crossover. First tank was 18.9 mpg - amazing for such a huge and heavy vehicle. Bose sound system is first rate, kids love riding in it; tech features very easily usable; endless cup holders and lights are great for 'car homework'. Can't recommend this one enough - it's close to perfect!!",4
833,I got a great deal on this little car more than a year ago and wanted to write a review. It's been a great for in town and it drives well on longer trips. Our two children fit easily in the back seat and the trunk has plenty of room for short trips. We have a manual and our average gas mileage is 32 mpg in town and 38 mpg on the hwy. I think it is the best bang for the buck when compared to other manufactures. My experience has been great with all Toyota products.,4
834,"I have been a loyal Toyota owner since 1996, but I bought my first Honda because of its clever interior and nice exterior design. It is much quieter in the Civic EX cabin than in the Prius or Corolla cabin. I love the split dash display, the extra storage nooks on the dash and center console, the large windshield. The ride is wonderfully smooth and quiet. I also love the speed-sensitive volume control. The small storage spot under the heater control was just perfect for my Sirius radio, and I love the auxiliary input below the 12-volt outlet. My only real disappointment is the low fuel efficiency. With my Tercel, I was getting 42 mpg composite. With the Civic EX, I get only 33 mpg.",3
835,"We needed a new vehicle that would accommodate our two growing children and something that had decent mileage for my 134 mile daily round trip work commute. Honda Fit and other like vehicles didn't offer free safety features such as side impact airbags and A/C were considered OPTIONAL. We were floored when we found the Jeep Patriot (base model.) It offered more room, the standard features that we needed, really good gas mileage, and a fun, TONKA toy kind of ride. On this last tank of gas we averaged 26.8 MPG! Being in the NOLA area, I also wanted something big enough to sleep in if we had to evacuate:) You get a heck of a lot of bang for your buck with a Jeep Patriot!",4
836,"After shopping hybrids, smart cars, and flex fuel, I opted on the Mini Cooper. It is great on short hops and long trips. I have been getting incredible gas mileage on regular grade gasoline, 40 in town, 47 highway. The car handles like a dream and one cannot omit the ""fun"" factor to drive one. I have 16"" run on flat tires, so the ride is a little bumpy at times, but for what it is, I consider it plenty comfortable. Nice leg room (I am 6'0"" and still must move the seat up some) for the driver and passenger. Leg room for backseat passengers is questionable. My wife liked mine so much, she bought an ""S"" model with automatic. Recommend sport suspension and seats, with stereo upgrade.",3
837,"This is my 4th Avalon out of my last 5 cars. Needless to say, I have been happy overall. I had an 1997, 2001, 2004 and now the 07. Car has a lot more power than any previously. Very roomy for back seat passengers.",3
838,"I love driving my car, however I have put on 17,000 miles and I am getting ready to put on the 3rd set of tires. Dealership says these cars eat tires and I agree! At $200.00 a pop for 205/50R17 they are expensive!",3
839,"We bought this car for the advertized fuel economy and to buy American. I alway buy AWD, but thought FWD would be fine and thought mild increase in fuel economy would be good. Wrong!This car can't get out of it's own way in the snow. It's so heavy in the rear there is no weight on the front tires. Forget about pulling onto a street after a snowstorm. The MPG is 15.5 at best. You can get near the 24 on the highway if you don't exceed 65 MPH. All in all, 15.5 is not 16-24 that they advertize. I am a sad consumer when 2 of the three reasons I bought it were a fraud.",1
840,"This car has blown repeated computers, ohms regulator, the air conditioner blower replaced, the cup holder has jammed into the dash, the trunk leaks, the motor already has a 'knocking sound'. It has literally been in the shop nearly as much as in my garage. Can't get it repaired timely because they apparently don't make the parts until there is a problem. If this is a car you need to be dependent on, don't buy it. If you have the patience to work with the mechanics, go for it, its beautiful, but I'd recomend waiting until the next line comes out, my car seems to be a 'beta' test version.",1
841,"We went looking for a small, reliable car with a/c with a strong preference for a hatchback. We focused on the usual suspects - Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Scion whatever, Toyota Matrix/Pontiac Vibe. Then we saw the Versa at a Hertz sales lot, liked it, researched it and could buy it for $3,000 under KBB. Negatives are rear visibility and stability in cross winds. A big positive is roominess whether carrying four people or two people and two bicycles - they fit in all the way without having to take off a wheel. When we bought we would have preferred a Matrix if the money was close to the same. That would have been a mistake.",3
842,"Love the car, the switch from battery to gas isn't noisy, but a little jerky at first, but as you drive you forget it. Rides well, and handles great. A little soft on power but it's only a 4 banger. If driven right, the mileage will be 40 highway and 45 city. You can't beat that for the size of the vehicle. I love it.",3
843,"I've had the car for a few months now and it's been a good experience so far. I've had friends drive it and not believe it was a 4 cylinder. Great gas mileage and turn radius. I'm 6ft and 285lbs and I fit comfortably. However, the door roof is a bit low - I can easily bang my head getting into the car if I'm not careful. There's also this weird thing that happened twice. When I'm doing a K Turn, if I take the car out of reverse and into drive to quickly the car shuts off. I know, it's a quirky issue and I know it's not a high performance car but my 1982 Gremlin never had that problem (-:",3
844,"I have been very impressed so far after taking delivery of my new 328xi. The tight cornering, quick acceleration, and solid feel are the best selling points. BMW USA and my local dealer have treated me like royalty! The exterior styling is not over-the-top, but elegant and bordering on conservative. The performance and power are exceptional. The advanced technology is not overwhelming - it just works. I am very happy.",4
845,"At 54, this was my very first new car...ever! Everyone said what great cars Hondas are, so I was excited to be buying one, and my beloved Element to boot. At 1000 miles it had been in the shop twice for fuel tank sensor issues. Now at just shy of a year and only 5700 miles I am truly disappointed. It IS fun to drive and I love its funny nerd cool look, but the quality really lacks....small irritations: defrosters are non- existent, radio speakers vibrated from the start, driver's side doors rattle. I'm a single old guy, so it's hardly been given rough treatment.",1
846,"I was looking for a car with good gas mileage and enough room inside for my 12 year old son who is now 5'11 1/2"" tall. He needs room to grow over the next 3-4 years of anticipated ownership and is supposed to end up about 6'6"" tall! We checked out a variety of cars in the similar class, with fuel efficiency & cabin size being the #1 priorities. Not only does the Aveo offer ample headroom and decent leg space for a compact car, but it's paying for itself! The reduced insurance cost, improved gas mileage and decent styling led us to this car. Our former car was an Xterra, and there is as much interior cabin space in this tiny Aveo as we had before - but more then twice the MPG's.",3
847,"This is my dads car. I drive it all the time, but i also drive my moms 2007 rabbit which I prefer to drive. The Jetta just doesn't stop like the rabbit at all. And it doesn't accelerate. The steering is almost the same but not quite as good as the rabbit. Overall I think that it is a good car but not great.",3
848,"Mine is loaded journey 3k miles and pushing it for speed. Homerun vehicle. The details are excellent. Look at the wipers and the engine, all details are exceptional. Getting 18mpg city. Put the paint sealent on - Jetseal 109 and clear bra",4
849,"This care is absolutely one of the best deals around for the price. The rebates Ford gives right now are amazing, I got $3500 back. It may not have the interior of a BMW, but it doesn't have the sticker either. The car is absolutely wonderful, shifting is very easy and smooth. Looks like a luxury car, drives like one too.",4
850,"We just bought the car 5 days ago. The power is intoxicating to say the least! Brakes are great. The interior is so much nicer than the 2006 model. The seats have good side bolsters for those spirited backroad jaunts. The fuel mileage is pretty poor at 18 mph average so far. Hopefully it goes up a few more points after break-in period. The ride is similar to the BMW 325is coupe I had a few years back, sporty but not too bumpy. Haven't driven in the snow yet, but I assume the all-wheel drive and the narrower 17 inch tires should be ok. Once the snow is gone, this car will get a set of 18 inch sport wheels and tires. I think the Boxster will stay in the garage until spring!",3
851,I love my G. It's a great car and so much fun to drive. I feel safe when driving it and it's small so very convenient to get around in. All in all it's a great car just a few complaints.,4
852,"I loved this great looking vehicle on the road! Loved it, loved it, loved it! Until I purchased it! I was very disappointed the very first day! I could feel every tiny bump on the road, the steering wheel is very tight, therefore it's not very easy to maneuver. I also couldn't adjust the seat into a comfortable position, and was suffering from the back pain until I got used to it. I am 5,6"" and I guess this car is not for shorties. Moms, beware! The metal anchors are so deep, it took me about 20 minutes to install the car seat! Right now I got used to the car, love all other features: Bluetooth, tech pack, back-up camera and keyless entry, but will be looking for another one soon.",1
853,My driver's side door latch keeps coming loose and making a clunking sound when I go over even the smallest of bumps. The dealer has repaired it 5 times and the noise came back again. I'm in the process of taking the car to Lemon law arbitration to force the dealer to give me my money back. Jim in MA,0
854,Only have a few thousand miles on it but it's everything it's built up to be.,3
855,I swore off all American vehicles but then realized I needed the room so I looked at the Denali..what a surprise!! This SUV is awesome.. blows away the other two Fords I have owned. I don't feel like I am driving a truck. This redesign is nothing like the previous model and a loaded Denali is no different then the Escalade without the price tag and bling factor. I LOVE this SUV!!,4
856,"I love this SUV, Kia really stepped up this time. The 262 Hp really makes her move and gives you that extra passing power when needed. We just got our first big snow for the year and it did very well in 9 Inches of snow. I felt in control and very safe when driving even when I saw much bigger SUV's all over the road. I would tell anyone that is looking for a mid-size SUV this is the one hands down. Plus the auto 4x4 - it knows the road better than you do.",4
857,"This car is hands down the classiest looking large crossover/suv on the market. Fully loaded with the 7 passenger seating this car is nicer than a Mercedes GL or R Class. I never thought I'd buy a Buick, but after istting in this car and test driving it, we knew we had found a winner. GM's 100K mile warranty makes ownership hassle free. Other reviewers have mentioned it, the car would benefit from more power, but then again, gas isn't going back to $2/gallon anytime soon, and for around town there's plenty of power. How many people are going to drag race with this car anyway. Second row bucket seats make 3rd row access easier, and really make this a hands down winner it its class!",4
858,the size if this suv is perfect for a single person or family if you are not looking for a full size suv or minivan,2
859,"Had my vehicle for over a month now, and I LOVE it. Nice interior, nice ride, great style - especially for the price. You just can't beat this spacious SUV and its 10 year warranty. It has a luxury feel with an affordable price. Beats Saturn Vue, Honda CRV and Toyota Rav 4 in all areas. Great family vehicle!",4
860,"We just downsized from a SUV to the Civic EX. We started looking at vehicles about 4 months ago, giving ourselves time to make sure we were making the right decision. Because of the Honda reputation, we started there. We drove almost every car in the Civic category and kept coming back to it. We were mostly focusing on gas mileage, as I drive approximately 75 miles per day, back and forth to work. The Civic is dependable and fun to drive, I love whipping into parking spaces, and hugging corners! We also have 2 children, 9 and 5. They have plenty of leg and hip room, and love riding in our new car! The EX is nicely equipped and still affordable. We are very pleased with our decision!",4
861,"The 2008 Enclave has been a great car to date. It has been a pleasure to drive. Very comfortable and very roomy. Gas mileage has been as expected. Have been getting 22.7 MPGs on highway / 16 MPGs around town. Very good for a vehicle this size. Another buyer who never thought he'd be in a GM or Buick product but was won over (considered Mazda CX-9 & Toyota Highlander). Great car after 2,000 miles. Very smooth ride (my mother is ready to trade in her Lexus RX 450). We'll see what the future holds.",3
862,"This car is what luxury cars are all about. The interior fit/finish is second to no car on earth. The exterior design is flawless, even the grille is growing on me. The incredible power of the W-12 powertrain is nothing short of amazing. The ride and handling balance is perhaps best in class. I absolutely love it.",4
863,"All I can say is wow! Ford has finally done it, they have just built a great car. Gas mileage is great I get an average 35 mpg combined driving. Minimum road noise smooth ride and great handling. Engine is quite peppy for a four cyl and I have no problem passing other cars. If you are looking for a new car buy this one and forget about the imports. Way to go Ford.",4
864,Great little car agile and tough lots of fun to drive. Great in the snow. A real winner.,4
865,"Nice looking car. Mileage in the city is averaging 32 mpg according to the on board mileage calculator. I thought it would be a lot better. Everything is great, the only negative thing is that the gas engine is noisy when it first starts up when the car has not been driven for a while. As the engine warms up it gets a little quieter.",3
866,"Just picked up a new 2008 Jeep Liberty Limited with leather, sunroof, remote start, tow pkg, & heated seats. All I can say is wow, this is a nice Jeep. I had a 2004 Wrangler Unlimited that I loved, but the lease was up, and it was time to trade again. I went with the Liberty Limited, since it had so many standard safety features, and slightly better gas mileage then the new Wranglers, plus the incentives were better for the Liberty.",3
867,"I see some people are complaining about fuel milage, I can tell you that I get about 20 hwy and about 16.5 in city. Best truck ever.",4
868,"Overall, the 2008 Camry hybrid is a good car. Good performance. Smooth and quite, even at 80 MPH. Accelerates quickly when needed. Mine has enough gadgets to keep me occupied for years. It would be hard to go back to a regular car. Mileage is about as advertised - 33.1 thus far, with 40 MPG common when crusising at about 50 MPH. The hard sell by the dealer to buy the extended warranty because of potentially expensive repairs down the road made me a bit nervous. I didn't buy it, so I hope Toyota's reputation for quality meets my expectations.",3
869,"We wanted to go green. We didn't know how we'd adjust coming from 2 new Audi A4 quattros (a 98 and 05). We got this and we don't regret it. It has enough zip. It's comfortable & roomy enough for 4 adults. I've only filled the tank 5 times. The first 4 I averaged about 36/37 MPG. This last one I did about 38 MPG. (402 miles on 10.5 gallons). Not bad comparing to my Audi but not the 40/45 advertised. The car was bucking this afternoon. Don't know what it is. I have about 1,500 miles on it now and it's not the first time it's happened. Overall I like the car and like the economy payment and low gas cost. We must all conserve folks. Buy economical. We liked it better than the Prius.",3
870,"I chose the C70 over an Audi due to the hardtop. I have had it in the shop seven times and 90 days since May '08 for roof issues. Fortunately none of them have been major, but a major inconvenience on my time. My biggest problem has been getting anyone from Volvo corporate to give me a call to discuss some kind of resolution.",1
871,"I loved the look of the new Escalade and alas that is all the car is. Just something good to look at. But it is a mechanical nightmare. This truck looks, drives and feels like it was put together in a hurry. I only have 2500 miles on it and the tranny bucks like a horse at least 3 times a day. Cadillac has reprogrammed some kind of computer but it keeps doing it and they say that there is nothing that they can do to fix it. It also idles very rough, the first month we had it it was fine and now it vibrates so badly at stop lights that it is embarrassing. Cadillac told me to use premium, I have and it still does it.Sometimes the power lift gate does not want to work. Should've gotten a 08 Sequoia",0
872,I wanted a shifter sedan that had AWD but something different from an Audi/BMW. I loved the looks of this car and how solid it feels when driving. To me it is a true sport sedan. I think I would be happier with the short-throw gearbox and will probably have that installed by the dealer before too long. It is a great road trip car but definitely sucks down the premium fuel. Overall I have been very happy with the car and plan to drive it for years to come. I had an Acura previously and while I think the Subaru is much more fun to drive I miss the interior quality of the Acura.,3
873,"I researched and test drove everything else in this style of vehicle (Acadia, Buick, Nissan, Mazda, Honda). For the money, this is the best by far. The ride is excellent, the nav is great and the graphics are much better than GM. I love the cockpit feel of the cabin and the comfort of the seating. The exterior got my attention and the interior keeps it. I have three children ages 10, 8 and 8 and we are in a carpool with two other kids for a total of 6 people in the vehicle. We can easily fit one more. We have 16.6 MPG with mixed driving (mostly driving in the local neighborhoods). Got over 23 MPG when on the highway for a short period of time. We look for reasons to drive places!",4
874,I have owned everything from a Toyota Corolla to a BMW. As I have gotten older practicality and reliability are huge factors in my decision making now. The Xterra is the best midsize SUV on the market. It is also the best value. Do your own research and see for yourself. Depending on where you are in the country you should be able to get a new one at or under invoice if rebates are included. Major improvement over the old body style and engines.,4
875,"I absolutely love my Passat. I have owned about a dozen VWs and this is by far the best yet. The car is very quick, smooth, quiet and luxurious. I have had no problems and I am sure the car will hold up well over the next few years.",4
876,"I picked up the car and drove it 350 miles back home. I was very suprised how quiet and comfortable the car was. The performance is out of this world. The car pulls so hard and builds speed so quickly. It has a suprisingly comfortable ride. I have owned many sports cars and this not only was the greatest value, but the greatest all around car.",4
877,"This is my first experience in the entry level luxury market, and as they say, you get what you pay for. It is worth every penny. This car turns heads everywhere I go. It offers more than BMW, without the inflated Lexus price tag. Check one of these cars out before you buy anything else.",4
878,"I absolutely LOVE my new Ford Escape. I've had it for about 6 months now, and I love it just as much today as the first day I bought it. The design is so gorgeous inside and out. The V6 has a lot of get up. It's extremely comfortable. I see other Escapes on the road and smile because it really is a GREAT looking car. Everyone who rides in it is surprised by how nice it really is. In fact, a friend of mine went out and bought one last week. I definitely recommend this to everyone.",4
879,"This vehicle is adding years to my life. I'm comfortable and stress free in traffic. Love how quiet the ride is, the DVD system is great for the kids, great heat, tons of room, very safe on ice or in poor winter driving conditions, visibility good in front and lights are perfect for highway driving. Fuel mileage not what the old Corolla used to get, but what do you really want? You're driving something much bigger. Had to have the radio replaced at 8 000 k but no problems otherwise. Noticed a bit of a rattle in the front sunroof after 10,000k.",3
880,"We were so happy when we bought our Acadia. Great looks, power, and felt solid. After we bought the car we learned how bad the fuel economy was. I also noticed the hesitation up hills. Throttle response is terrible if you step on it. At 8,000 miles check engine light came on. Service center told us fuel cap and camshaft problem? Camshaft? Only 8,100 miles on this car.",1
881,"Be prepared to be impressed - from putting on some of Cadillac's color options - to the extensive standard equipment, all are better on this car. If the same level of attention paid in planning then building this car can be transfered to others in the GM Family - watch out world for market share will return back to the USA!",4
882,"I have had my 08 XLE for almost a month, it has been awesome. The engine is very strong and i have no problems passing cars on the freeway. I average about 21 mpg around town and on the open road i have gotten up to 28 mpg cruising at 70 mph. The seats are very comfortable and the ride is smooth like a Lexus and quiet too. The JBL sound system is awesome and the navigation system is very easy to use and has bluetooth and satellite radio. The build quality is top notch and resale value is the best.",3
883,I have an 08 DC SR5. Right out of the gate i did a 3 n 1 leveling kit. Makes it look great! Aftermarket 20s with 33x13.5 all terrains. I have loved the truck from the get go. it only gets better as I add more to it. I am getting 15.5 mpg on the new england roads. I despise the VSC but I am told the sway bar will help eliminate the frustration I have with it. My brother who has only had cars was impressed with the smoothness of the ride (we had 2 sportbikes in the bed and were at 80 on the highway). My girlfriend/wife loved it some much that she bought a DC limited. Being a full size Chevy guy my whole life I have been truly impressed.,3
884,"This is one of the greats, for sure. Classic lines, great build quality, amazing powertrain. The engine always feels 'on boil' and the transmission gearing matches the power band perfectly. Great noises - I almost never turn on the radio with this engine and exhaust note filling the cabin. Still gets a lot of looks even though the B8 body style is out. I'll be keeping this one for a long time to come.",4
885,"I have a fully loaded Q7 and love it for its size and looks. But my husband has wanted another Audi so we went out and got a fully loaded A6. Could not be happier with it. After being pleased with Audi we went out and got another one a R8 for the power. But out of all of the cars we like the A6 the best for its looks and power and all the stuff you can get on it. Such as Keyless go (we payed extra to get that installed) Navigation, backup camera, and sensors, the blinds in the back, wood steering wheel.",4
886,"We recently bought our Yukon Hybrid as a demo model, so got a great deal (GM Certified used vehicle - 41,000 miles left on bumper-to-bumper warranty). I averaged 23.7 mpg on 400 mile trip home from dealership, driving 65-70 mph on interstates. Am now averaging 24.5 mpg combined city/highway driving in my local area. The hybrid system, and instant economy display really encourage you to drive light-footed, and I have never been light-footed until now. It is a hoot to drive - the hybrid system is virutally seamless in transition, and the V8/V4 cylinder deactivation system works really well. As an added bonus, you can sneak up on your friends and neighbors up to 30 mph, like a big golf cart..",4
887,"This a great fun package, and I am one of the few around that owned the original Ford version. MY first car 40 years ago was a rusty old ford retractable hardtop, and I was hooked. Have had other convertibles since and own a nice 1980 corvette now. Have never looked at Pontiac till I saw this convertible and had to have it. 3.5 v6 powerful enough and very smooth. White diamond tri-coat with taupe leather, what a stunning car. I knew there would be no trunk and bought it anyway instead of a mustang convertible. Intend to keep this car for at least 10 years.",4
888,Bought this one because of absurd oil prices. Wanted a reliable smaller car that was good on gas but still had some interior room. The economy is good and I'm averaging around 30 so far. Headroom is fine. Road noise is still too intrusive. The doors need protective moldings. The dash is terrible and too far away to read properly. Why can't Toyota put the dash where it belongs? The old style 4 speed automatic sometimes is jerky and I would wish for a newer 5 speed automatic like some competitors use. Also more power would be appreciated.,2
889,"After a year of research and test driving various SUVs and crossovers we settled on the HH and decided to order exactly what we wanted. We had test driven several HH and other hybrids and all were quiet, but none impressed us like the HH. When our HH came in we were excited. It was beautiful and had everything we wanted, except for the NOISE! When we brake to slow down it sounds like a jet engine winding down. It also has a click. We were expecting the quiet we had experienced with the other HHs we drove, but were greatly disappointed. The dealership has told us that some hybrids have that noise more than others - it is normal. I won't order again. I buy what I test drive on the lot.",1
890,"This is a great SUV all-around, but the diesel clinched it for me. It just makes so much sense for trucks and SUVs. Yes, it's a hair louder than a gas engine under acceleration (which is excellent, by the way, because of all that torque). But cruising is very quiet, and there's absolutely no smoke or odor, ever. Bottom line: you get the space and utility you need at a thrifty 26 mpg. Plus, you can feel good about being green with the smaller carbon footprint. Really, you've got to try one.",4
891,"My boyfriend bought the van over a year ago for him and his kids. He was sold on the ""safety feature"" that said that any obstruction would automatically open the side door. Since then we have constantly had problems with the power doors-- if you are on any type of incline, the power doors have a great chance of not closing as well as sliding forward on their own. His 9 year old son has actually had his hand crushed in the doors (that DID NOT automatically open) when he was reaching to grab his seat belt to buckle in as the door closed. Both of his children are now terrified of the closing doors and warn their friends to not touch the doors. I am almost 30 and even I get nervous about it.",1
892,"I just purchased my new 2008 Acura MDX Sport and I love it. My trade was a 2004 Acura TL. The MDX is very quick, has great handling, smooth ride, and the fit and finish is excellent. The interior design is very intuitive and the navigation system is easy to use. There is plenty of passenger and storage room. I love the exterior design. Must have accessories are the sport running boards, side body molding, roof rails/cross bars, and the front and rear silver garnish. This is definitely a high performance SUV with lots of luxury!",4
893,"After extensive research (a must being an engineer) and looking and test driving multiple cars, I settled on this model. It gives you all the extras you want with a reasonable price. The design is amazing, and fun to drive. I owned a 99 Honda EX Coupe and it was noisy on the highway. This one, however, it was really quiet. Inside is very spacious and comfortable. Would definitely recommend.",4
894,"I needed a reliable, sporty, family-friendly car to replace my Audi S4 (which I loved), from a local dealership, and had ruled out the repair-prone German imports, at least for this purchase cycle. This car fits the bill. Reliable. Stylish. Excellent performer. Unbeatable technology. Great buying and dealership experience. Highly recommended.",4
895,"It's the most fun car to drive and the fuel economy is amazing. I gave it a 9 in comfort because power locks and windows should be standard. This is my first Toyota, and I will buy another when this commuter, is done. I drive an average of 30K a year, and it was my parents, Toyota Camry with 340K miles that made my decision to look at the Yaris.",4
896,"I've only had it for a little over a week but so far loving it. The only negative is the fuel economy. My kids love the dual moonroof and the DVD player. I love the way it handles. I loved my Honda Odyssey but I was ready to not have a ""Mommy Mobile"" and this fits the bill. I still have room to cart around my children's friends without having to drive a van. I have never purchased American but so far so good. I was also deciding between Mazda CX-9 and Acadia and after talking to my mechanic he pushed me to the GMC. He said Mazda parts are hard to get and American made vehicles have come a long way over the last several years.",3
897,"Purchased first Honda car after years of owning Corollas. Was looking for a four door with more power, and great gas mileage. Purchased the car due to its many performance, safety features and its low price. I am satisfied with the vehicles performance, and have been getting 30 mpg. I could use more room in the front seat, but I am 6'3'' 250 lbs. Car has many blind spots. Overall, it seems to be a solid car, nice combination of ride/ handling. Easily accelerates to highway speeds. Peace of mind with the standard side curtain air bags. The interior dash is different but a nice change.",3
898,"This is the most versatile vehicle available in the market segment, We have six of them for our sales people. a 2004,(2)2005,(2)2006 and a 2007 we take the rear seats out and you can fit so much more equipment in them than our two Highlanders,We deliver equipment to construction sites so the all-wheel drive comes in handy as well, I like the new instrument illumiation over the others as well as the vehicle stability control,new seat belt location and side curtian air bags.",3
899,"I have been looking for a car for the past year. Looked at Audis, Benzes, Lexus, Infiniti, Hondas, Toyotas and finally Nissan. I was leaning toward the Accord coupe V6 but when I saw the Altima coupe in precision grey, I was hooked. I got mine fully loaded and I can't believe all the looks and double takes this car receives. This car makes me want to leave work early just to drive and park around a group of people just for the comments.",4
900,"I commute 120 miles a day, so gas mileage was of paramount importance. I have always owned Hondas and loved them-except for this one. The passenger/driver sun visors have broken 3 times. The paint is blistering and peeling off the bumpers. The windshield is VERY long, prone to cracking and the sun visor will take up what little cargo space there is. The rear child tethers are so close to the seat, you cannot use them. I was informed today the brakes need replacing every 20-25,000 miles since all the 2008 have a new brake system to eliminate braking noise that results in 1/2 the usual brake life. I'd rather have the noise...and a different car. $300 every 8 months is pricey.",1
901,"Great vehicle. I always wanted a Mini but needed to be able to transport my two boys in the back. The Clubman was the answer. Excellent pick-up; excellent grip; great 6 speed tranny; and you gotta love the barn doors in back. Gas mileage is, of course, great; 28 city and 33 highway. The ride is also much more secure and settled on the hwy with the longer wheelbase vs the Cooper coupe.",4
902,"I'm in the military and bought this through the on post car sales and I've only been driving it about a month and some change. But so far I really enjoy the vehicle like said earlier dosen't have a lot of off the line power but it has more HP than the average 4 banger, especially considering the last 4 banger I drove was in 94. Anyway all around I personally think its a great deal and the test drive is what took me to this over the Dodge Nitro. Not as flashy but rides smoother and dosen't have a huge parking brake right beside your thigh, that's just my opinion though go test drive it yourself see how you like it versus these reviews",3
903,"I'm 6'3"" tall and the Prius is big enough for me. It is comfortable and fun to drive. So far I'm averaging 48 miles per gallon, doing mostly city driving.",3
904,"This truck is a typical well built, reliable vehicle from Toyota. I just got out of a full size P/U and I'm confident this 07 Tacoma will perform as well or better than my full size one.",3
905,"I was very concerned buying a new GM vehicle after owning a Honda Pilot for the last 4 yrs, and picked this over the new MDX. This vehicle is much quieter on the hiway, is larger inside, more HP, and same gas mileage as the Pilot. Love the dark carpets even with the taupe leather, very comfy seats and hidden receiver hitch, chrome door handles. Wish I could've purchased front moonroof only. Tranny can't decide which gear to pick on hills at hiway speed, nature of the 6 speed beast. Highly recommend backup sensors due to small tailgate window.",2
906,Only had it a month. Mileage in mixed driving is 32 mpg. I got the Deluxe package which provides for better handling. Amazed at the standard equipment on such an economy car. Car is comfortable and roomy and I like it much better than most of the others in its class. It drives similarly to the VW Golf we rented in England a few years back. Don't care for the Pirelli P6 tires as we live where it gets cold and the traction in snow and ice is less than desirable.,3
907,BTW.. Love the car. Feels heavy car to drive. Kind of like a cadillac. Kids love it. Averaged 42 MPG on the 45 mile trip back from the dealership. It is really cool that the engine shuts off.,4
908,"I bought this vehicle with 20,000 miles on it. As a person finishing up college, I was looking for something reliable and affordable yet still stilish and interesting. Fuel consumption is amazing- I took a 300 mile trip at around 75 mph speeds and used only 1/2 tank of gas. I look for any reason to drive this car! The 4 cylinder engine isn't dissappointing- it delivers adequate acceleration and plenty of power for me. The speakers are great, love the light grey interior, and although the seats are a little uncomfortably firm, I am adjusting. This isn't a luxury car but it's reasonably priced, gets a ton of compliments, and is a pleasure to operate, plus the fuel economy is great.",4
909,"So far, the Rogue ownership experience has been positive. Comfortable ride, ample space for 2 adults and 3 kids. Good room in the back. Nice features and price points, which allows you to select how high or low you want to go in the features vs. price debate. The i-AWD feature is great for wet pavement - one can only hope for the same in the snow. Reliability is yet to be determined (too new).",3
910,"The 2008 CXL is an excellent sedan, with high mechanical reliability. It has adequate power, very comfortable, the design is most attractive and is a pleasure to drive. If you want a special long distance traveling vehicle, consider the Lucerne, it is comfortable and reliable.",4
911,"This is an excellent car. I am a single mom with 2 young kids in car seats and I love my CR-V. I had a 98 2- door Honda civic and I needed to get a more ""Family Friendly"" car with 4 doors for my kiddos. I don't regret it one bit. My civic had 205,000 miles and I never had a problem with it so of course I would want to go with another Honda. This is made for moms. I looking at a used Chevy Equinox due to the fact I didn't think I could afford this car but the dealership was great. It is fun to drive and I get excellent gas mileage.",4
912,"I traded in an older loaded Jeep Grand Cherokee for this & thought I'd miss the space but haven't had the first regret. I got mine loaded so the gadget factor is really fun! I didn't know how bluetooth worked so having it shut off my music for an incoming call is great-no more missed calls(and mic picks up my tot's voice in back great)! I love not having to deal with keys at all since I have a toddler. Love the Bose sound system but above all, love the ride! The drive is very smooth with CVT, once you're at speed it's SUPER quiet.. turn on jazz or classical for a great experience. It hugs the road too - didn't realize how bouncy the truck frame on my Jeep was. Avg'd 25 mpg. 10 stars!",4
913,"This is a great, fun car. The GTS model with all the toys is the one you want. The GPS navigation is easy to use, the Bluetooth is a great convenience, the 18 inch wheels give this car a fantastic look. I just wish this car, the GTS variant that is, was given more power and I do agree with another reviewer that it should be about 10-20 more horses. Despite that, the car handles greatly thanks to a solid chassis that also is begging for more power. Honestly, with the Electric Blue Pearl color, I am also getting thumbs up everywhere I go.",3
914,"So far I like the car, very sporty. Rides and handles nice, good pick up for a 4 cylinder. Good visibility, no obstructions, can see very well even with spoiler.",3
915,"I have the vivid red SX4 Sedan w/ conv & auto. I've owned over 150 cars in my life. New, used, old, big & small. This car really takes the cake for value, comfort, looks, performance, etc. I could go on and on. (Okay, I will!) I am 6' 350lbs and I fit! No tipping the head to get in or reach out and close door. (Big guys know what I mean.) I can easily open the door in the parking garage and slip in and out since the doors are so short. Glass everywhere. Feels like a greenhouse. Tall seating feels like you're in an SUV. Handles excellent. Easy to drift if you want. Sharp appearance. Beats Toyo, Nissan, Subies and most other small cars in the looks, ride and standards department.",4
916,"I traded my 06 TL for the more attractive looking TSX and am happy I did. The TSX has everything I liked about the TL, and more importantly, it doesn't have the things I didn't like about the TL. It is quicker off the mark, handles better, better mileage (not by much though), and it was made in Japan. I really hated the mapholders on the TL, but they are gone (sort of) in the TSX. Also the rear end of the TSX is much more attractive.The TL was of course quieter, but I am always playing something in the audio system, which actually sounds better in the TSX than the TL. All in all I am happier with the TSX than the TL. Be sure to test drive both.",4
917,"I like my Mazda. Bought it new, and now at 14k miles, having some problems. Warped front rotors, squeaking belts, steering clunk, transmission hesitant to go in gear from reverse to drive. The clunk happens mostly at low speeds, and comes from the passenger front. The tranny problem is not too good. It goes into gear when it is good and ready. It is a fun car to drive (handling) but the auto trans seems to always try to be in top gear so I am turning fewer revs. Do I really need to be in 5th gear while driving 35, turning 1800 revs? That's why I usually go 'manual' around town. It shifts to higher gears too quickly.",3
918,"I owned a Honda CRV but didn't like the driving. So, I checked out Ford Escape and loved it during the test drive. The driving was completely different from my old CRV. I felt I was so miserable driving the CRV. Now I'm more than happy with my Escape. The fuel economy is as good as CRV. I don't know why people say Japanese cars have better fuel economy than domestics. The fit and finish is awesome, too. I'm 6'2"", but still snug enough in my Escape. Oh, by the way, it's much much quieter than the old CRV, and even my friend's new CRV or RAV4 I've driven. My friends envy me and tells me as soon as their CRV, RAV4 lease expires, they buy Escape",3
919,"This Entourage minivan is the best qualtity car I have ever driven. I have driven BMW 3 series. Actually I am more satisfied than BMW in its comfort, brake, manuvering on the street, in all the matters in drving.",4
920,We absolutely love this car. Our previous vehicle was a Ford Explorer so it's been quite a change. Once all the comparisons were made in this class the Aura impressed us the most.We live in a hilly region so our gas mileage is only about 34 mpg hwy but still twice as high as our old Explorer.We just finished a 10 hour drive on our world famous Cabot Trail and this car stuck to the curves like glue.From a dead stop the 4 cylinder is a bit sluggish (not for the lead footed drivers) but has more than enough power to pass anything on the highway. At over 6 feet tall it is true that getting into this car takes some getting used to but once inside the fit and finish is the best bar none.,4
921,"Got this car early in the market, and still get compliments and heads double looking. I often don't know what to say in response to the compliments since I wasn't the one to design it. The combination of power, fuel economy, styling is perfect. Plenty of room(I'm 6'2""). The dashboard info and interior accent lighting one would expect on a $10 - $15,000 higher priced car. I love this car so much that this will be the first time I repeat-buy on a vehicle, and I'm a former Honda owner. Move out the way I'm coming to get a 2009 Aura!",4
922,"I've had my 2008 Hybrid for about 2 months. I avg'ed 33.5 mpg for first few tanks; last tank 35.6 mpg. I drive pretty quick. Mix of city/suburban/freeway driving. I'm 6'3"" and I am very comfortable driving. It is quiet, surprisingly quick and really a nice car.",3
923,"Nice h.p. and lrg. brakes,and love the look, but terrible mpg (11). Useless in four wheel drive in deep snow and mud with the limited slip rear end.You need, and should be able to have, all four tires digging at the same time. And why would you go from a sturdy 6 bolt hub, down to a 5 bolt. The VSC system, and transmission command system doesn't work correctly in cold climates, such as where I live in Maine.",2
924,"Purchased this SUV after having a 4 cyl 5 speed Sante Fe for 4 years & was quite happy with both service & reliability with Hyundai vehicles. Was looking for something comparable & found the 4 cyl 5 speed Tucson surprisingly similar to drive. Handles very well in the city with great gas mileage. Having purchased a front-wheel drive, a good set of snow tires handled winter driving in the snow well. The highway driving is very good but the engine works harder on hills with 4 passengers and a full load, which is to be expected. Interior noise is surprisingly quiet for a hard working engine as well as very smooth handling. Recommend this vehicle with anyone with kids.Trunk space is a minimum",4
925,"Love the ride of this product. Upgraded stereo system is outstanding. Very comfortable seating for 7 and plenty of storage behind 3rd seats without folding down. 0% financing was huge. Lots of thought put into functionality like hooks for grocery bags, storage compartments, cup holders, separate climate controls for rear seating. Lots of 110 outlets, sunshades, etc. Only drawback is steering is very soft. When passing I have to remember to give a little extra room because there's a lot of play. Also not XM or Sirius ready. It's capable but you have to purchase a $550 aftermarket kit. Then the antenna wire shows in the back on the outside. Engine loud when passing on highway.",3
926,"This is a excellent car to drive. I love my new SRT8. Hemi orange, 6.1 Hemi, Auto Stick, Kicker stereo system w/nav and Sirius sat radio. This is a must have for the car enthusiast.",4
927,"I was in a fairly bad crash with this car when another driver turned into me. The car was totaled but no one in my car was hurt, and judging from the damage someone in my car should have been. I am truly thankful that I drove a Versa.",4
928,"I bought this used with 9000 miles on it, still has a new car smell. Overall, this is a well-thought-out, practical yet fun car. It is versatile and safe too. I came from a V-6, but do not miss it at all. This 4cyl does the job nicely.",3
929,"I had a Town & Country and traded it in, it did not compare with the Sienna. I can't tell you how happy I am with the Sienna. The Sienna is nothing but class and a good looking car. I wish I had gotten it sooner.",4
930,"I went looking in Sept of '06 looking for a Vue but the Aura XE was love at first sight. This awesome driving experience is something to look forward to every day. The 3.5L V6 performs most superiorly to its counterparts from Japan and Europe. When driving conservatively on the highway I could achieve economy in the mid 30's. A great joy to drive; economy and powerful performance plus ample amenities for an excellent price of only $22K. The Saturn Aura should alert educated buyers of the excellence and perfection that a roadster can be. If you are an import zealot, how sad to forego the experience of driving a real car for an inferior one. VW, Honda, Toyota and Subaru; no comparison.",4
931,"I am a freeway/open road driver from a more rural area. Seldom (to never) are we in a rush hour crawl. The Yaris posts near hybrid fuel efficiency with out the hybrid's price tag. Power windows, locks and cruise control and fairly good CD sound along with power steering and A/C make this economy model more pleasurable than the economy models of 3 and 4 years ago. I am six-three 230 lbs and enjoy riding in and driving this car. My family has four Toyotas and I do not fit in my daughter's Corolla. The Yaris is a different story: it has better interior room.",3
932,"When I test drove the CX-7 Sport, I liked the car; however, after I purchased it and drove it for a longer period of time, I was not please with the rough ride. I was having second thoughts about this vehicle. Now, after owning the SUV for a month, I'm loving this SUV. I originally started out to purchase the Nissan Maxima until I saw this vehicle on the highway. It's roomy, the handling and braking is great, and I have gotten use to the ride.",3
933,"Overall we love our Honda Civic. It has been a good durable car that is good on gas mileage. However, for those of you who live in frigid areas... buyer beware. From groggy starts to a slowly warming engine to poor traction on ice and snow... winter will be a bit of a challenge.",2
934,"Very impressed with ride.Good visibility. Still running on our 1st free tank of gas. Mileage seems to be OK so far.Purchased 08 black rwd ltd with all the bells & whistles.We looked at all comp vehicles,nothing could touch the Liberty. Glad Jeep brought back the old Jeep line.",3
935,"This is my third BMW and the best one by far. The 335i moves off the line so quick you'd swear you were in a M3 or better? My last car was a 2005 330ci with the M sport package on it and I didn't think anything would rival the driving prowess of that car. Well, I was wrong! I strongly agree with one of the other reviews written earlier - this car is underrated! If you want speed coupled with amazing handling then don't look any further.",4
936,This SUV has great style both inside and out. This a a great car if you have one or two kids and the dog. It's actually less than advertised in the city and pertty good in the hwy. I just think it really lacks on pick up. It needs more power. Would have been great in a V6.,3
937,"I love the G35x w/ the 306HP it's great, however the MPG hasn't been over 20 MPG since I got it. Infiniti advertised 19/26 it's more like 13/18 and that's not good.",3
938,"I just purchased this truck within the past week so please keep this in mind when reviewing this score. This is an impressive truck with a quiet and smooth ride (could feel no vibration from the 4cylinder engine). this is a 4x2, with manual 5 speed tranny. Shifts smoothly. Great outward visibility. As soon as the artic conditions moderate here I plan to drive this vehicle a lot. Right now truck and I are hibernating. I will review this truck once a year.",3
939,"This car is easy to drive and comfortable. The outside appears small, though the inside, trunk included, is spacious. The engine is simple and strong and all seats recline. Good for girls and good for guys. (Look for the blue, it is a nice color, really cool.)",3
940,"Hard to beat for under 20K. Really, name something as loaded, refined and reliable (as Toyota) for the same price. So far, loving it: put a nav system into the double din - the cover is awesome, less tempting for thieves! Solid as a vault, decent handling, moderate power from 4cyl, averaging around 27 mpg on combination of spirited city driving and 90 mph+ highway cruising.",4
941,I've had the OUTLANDER long enough to put 6500 miles on it. I love the getup and go it has. Love the handling and the comfort it offers. The center armrest isn't very workable and the driver's side cup holder next to the window broke the first time my knee hit it. I've had a big problem with the steering wheel locking up. This is Saturday night and I'm stuck at the house because the steering wheels locked and I cannot get it to unlock.,3
942,So far the vehicle has been a great town and city cruiser out with friends. Love the center console and rear console for second and third row passengers. Love ride quality,3
943,For the past 9 years I have had an ML320 and was persuaded to trade it on a new Lexus. So I get the RX 350 and all I can say about it is that the fit and finish are great. For the rated horsepower it seems to underperform. I was used to a car that was much heavier with a lower horsepower rating that outperformed this dog. All I can say about the handling is that it reminds me of an old man car like the old Buick LaSabre. Very boring and no feel of the road. If you own an M Class hold on to it and treasure it.,1
944,"We love our first new van EXL with DVD. The interior was very well designed, very spacious, and very comfortable and room. Not so crazy about the gas mileage but still better than our old SUV.",3
945,"For years, I've stayed away from the Vette because of poor quality interior and poor feedback response. I've owned a S2000, 350z (modified twin turbo), Audi S4, and Lexus SC430. I can honestly say I'm impressed with every aspect of the care especially the great handling and daily livability. Feedback response is not as crisp as the S2000, but its good enough to instill confidence. The interior is so much better now, it feels like a luxury sports car (on-star, turn-by- turn navigation, radio frequency keyless entry/start, coach-like leather, and tactile sensation of each dial/button, phone). Every day, I find something more to like and I'm a hard person to please when it comes to details",3
946,"Totally surprised with the snap that this 4 cylinder engine has. Wife feels very safe in this car; have been in pickups the past 10 yrs and ready to downsize. Toyota quality and reliability brought me to the car; retiring next year and this is the sensible solution to fuel economy for a non hybrid. Plenty of nooks and crannies to put things, net assembly and cargo cover have out of the way place for storing. This car gets there now, no problem getting up to and over speed limits; runs so quite and handles so well you can be up to 80 mph before you realize it. I'm a big guy and the driver side is roomy and comfortable, selected the liqui-cell leather seats for my disabled lower back.",3
947,"This car is a blast, love the six speed manual. Window snug up feature sticks in cold weather and can be a pain during frezing rain trying to warm up the vehicle as the interior gets wet. I test drove the BMW 3 convertible and was sold on the Eos due to the year round drivability and the difference of 12k in price for less features than the Eos. I got the iPod adaptor and 17 inch wheels, both worth the upgrade charge. Needs blue tooth capability and HD radio, cruise control is hard to see while driving making it hard to use. But I do love this car.",3
948,"I have been driving my Prius for 2 months and it is by far the best car (out of 8 that I have owned) I have owned. I'm averaging 47.5 mpg - 75% highway, 25% city - I was expecting low 40s so I am thrilled. I have been impressed with the pickup and interior room.",3
949,It rocks!! Nothing else to say. OK Maybe a little more. I wish it had a little more pickup but it doesn't need it. The interior does scratch easily but it is beautiful.,4
950,"I have about 2000 miles on this car and it has never given me a single problem, the Nissan seal of approval really means something, it means you're getting a quality car! Love the CVT, love downshifting! People think I have a sound system when it's just the stock system that came with the car! A/C is really great! I get about 32 MPG highway and about 26 MPG city! Love the keyless entry, has a huge trunk I can fit anything in it. Love the new design and the new taillights.",4
951,"First time Ford buyer. Loved the looks, the comfort, the performance. Sat in other SUV's including Lincoln and Lexus, no difference. I actually liked the Edge better. After 1,000 miles, I like it even more. Who knew I would become a Ford believer. What a solid vehicle!",3
952,"Just got the 535i with premium, sport, premium audio, hd radio, ipod, satellite. The car is really fun to drive, the handling is incredible. I like the iDrive, it adds a little mystery and class to the car. But I received the car with a non function sos system. I have to return to dealer and have it fixed. I hope this the only thing that goes wrong",3
953,"We purchased the vehicle a week ago. The engineering is very good, amazing to think they could pack in as much in such a small vehicle. I was concerned about the gas mileage but now after about 600+ miles seem to be averaging 21 to 22+ mpg. It is fast and if you drive it like a race car it will only get 16 to 17 I am sure. I still have not had a chance to read all of the instructional info but believe once I figure it out it will be a blessing. The hands free blue tooth is great. The leather and interior is as nice as Mercedes and more higher end cars. My wife had some problems with the smart key etc. in her first foray driving about 400 miles. She got pulled over going over 80 mph.",3
954,"Great car for the money. Four doors, an auto, and over 30 mpg with Honda reliability. This car is everything a family needs -- up to three children. Also, the total ownership cost is minimal.",3
955,"So far a good car (6k miles already), engine is powerful for a small car! Noise on highways better than earlier models. However shifting in lower gears is kinda rough, more of an annoyance than anything!",3
956,"The Toyota Yaris S Sedan is a stylish, reliable, and fuel economic vehicle. For all it has to offer, along with it's highly reasonable price, I recommend it to anyone.",4
957,My wife has always said she loved spyders and pushed me to get one until I finally gave up. I was driving by when I saw the 2007 Eclipse and decided to stop. I fell in love with this car as soon as I sat in it. I took it home to the wife and she was in complete shock that I broke down and got it! Riding around town with the top down is just great and this car will turn heads!,4
958,"Surprised at the fit and finish of an American assembled MB. Quite a departure from my '98 ML320 that my mechanic often cursed 'this is not a Mercedes!' Why choose the GL450/550 when 1) gas version comes at a $2500 premium over the diesel (not the case usually with diesel vehicles) 2) gas version requires premium unleaded fuel (premium still costs more than diesel) 3) the diesel gets 18/24 gas gets 13/18 ( GL550 will fare worse); average economy for both cars at 12k miles/year and factoring price differences for premium vs. diesel you'd save ~$600/yr in fuel savings on top of the $2500; Not noisy, not slow, no smoke or smell; 0-60 who cares?? it's an SUV",3
959,"So my 1999 Chevy Blazer goes down with a broken crankshaft, which is funny cause I just about replaced everything else on it. Well I really can't complain 200,000 miles later. So a friend turns me on to the Ridgeline. Since the first test drive I still wonder why people buy Chevy and Ford. The Ridgeline offers a comfortable smooth car-like ride while keeping the power and durability of a truck. A wider wheelbase and higher elevation makes driving easier with better sight of the road and amazing handling. No blind spots and sweet take off power.",3
960,This is a very smooth riding car and is easy to drive.,3
961,"This auto has some great features for the price and is fun to own and drive. We had to select between a CRV and this vehicle and the value proposition made the final decision easy. The two cars were actually very similar, but the Saturn Vue XE had more features for the money. We also looked at the HHR, but this Vue had a larger-car feel from the inside. While the car is a German design, and built in Mexico it actually had a good US part content. This was our first American brand vehicle since about 1994. The ownership experience is making me think I will trade my Acura MDX in the future for another American branded car.",3
962,"We purchased this car thinking we would never have another new car since we are retired and getting old and wont be driving that many years. The wind noise in this car is so bad we can't talk. We have taken it back to dealer any number of times. First they said Nissan was working on the problems and to come back in a month, we did that, after 3 trips to dealership we are getting that is a characteristic of this car and nothing can be done about it. We are very unhappy with the way we have been treated. I am really not just an old woman trying to grip, we do have a problem and can not get any one to help us. All I can say don't buy a Nissan Rouge, it is a waste of good money.",0
963,"Great car. Love to drive it when I can get it away from my wife. Excellent mileage. Good performance for a 2.0 litre. Styling turns heads and gets compliments. The toys inside rock. It's a total 21st century rig. Lots of room for the size of the vehicle. Overall, we love this car.",4
964,"Bought this vehicle seeking reasonable price point and good fuel economy. The car delivers both with excellent results! I have daily multi-destination commutes and put nearly 600 miles/week on this vehicle among 3 drivers. We routinely get 30+ miles/gallon in mixed driving, and the car is comfortable for all of us, ranging from 5'5"" to over 6 feet. Seats are wide enough for middle-aged spread, and pickup in lower gears is exceptional. No complaints from this happy owner! Check this out before buying a Honda or Toyota Corolla.",3
965,"Let me start by saying, I like the van and this is my second one. But the new design has a whistling sound when doing 65-70 MPH. The problem is around the windshield on the unit, Between the window and the pillar that extends to the roof. The rubber insert is not long enough and it causes a whistle sound. You will need to tape the outside until you can run a thin bead of caulk under the rubber to prevent the wind from getting in. I do a lot of driving in a year (42,000 annually) and I currently have it taped and it has stopped the noise. Good luck.",1
966,"Fun to drive, good on gas, the doors slam like a big car. :-) What more could you want?",4
967,"I bought a kia rio sedan in 2008 have had a new transmission put in to date still having problems with transmission automatic shift from park reverse or drive to revervse is very slow I am left seating in the road waiting for it transmission to shift I feel this is a safety issue and kia should correct it after many many time taking it to shop they tell me I dont know have to drive and there is nothing wrong with my car, it is the worst car I have ever had will not buy another one nor would I recommend anyone else to buy one.",0
968,"I've had my Equinox for four months now and am very pleased with my purchase. I test drove practically every SUV in the class and the Equinox came out on top. I came close to buying a Rogue, but the interior was cramped and lacked features. I am partial to the exteriors of the RAV4 and the Ford Edge; however, they are also lacking in the features department (at least on the basic models). The Equinox comes with a lot of bells and whistles for the price. I love the OnStar feature and the information screens. With one push of a button, I can check my oil life, tire pressure and remaining gas mileage, etc. The fuel economy isn't bad for a vehicle its size. Overall a great purchase.",3
969,I leased this car for two years. It beat out two other models barely. I wanted a manual transmission but this one is real stiff and start offs are hard to mix gas with clutch. My Model A Ford is smoother. Once past 1st gear it's good. The car runs smooth and has plenty of power. The interior has good quality materials. I can manage for 2 years but will buy larger and domestic next time. Gas mileage is not too good right now but is over 30. I expect this will improve. This Sentra is a good solid car.,3
970,"This is my first large SUV. I traded in my 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander XLS for the Sequoia SR5. And I am very happy with it. I feel like the king of the road. I compared it to GMC, Chevy, Nissan and Mazda and the Sequoia stood out more to me with better engine performance 381 hp! 401 lbs torque, wow, better mpg, interior quality, comfort and better looking than most. Just buy it, you wont regret it!",4
971,"I have driven full and mid sized SUVs for years, but missed the fun of a bit of a ""performance car"" but still have a family now, so a 2 seater or 2 + 2 was out of the question. This is a great blend of functionality, luxury and performance. The list of standard features is staggering. When you compare this to a 3 series BMW you will find 40K plus to get close to the standard equipment on the TL, and that is with BMW's standard ""leatherette"" interior without upgrade. Yes, for those who have not researched it, real leather is NOT standard on a 3 series, you pay about $1,500 to get it. Now, at the very high end, BMW gets the performance nod, but for the average commuter, this is a win",4
972,Gave up an MBZ for this. Love it so far. Nicely equipped. Many options are priced much lower than European counterpart. Excellent GPS with touch screen making the nav system in BMW looked like junk. Ride is soft with a good amount of leaning when cornering. Stiffer suspension should be standard on this car or offer a sport package.Flip out mirror control is obscured by the steering wheel. Excellent acceleration. Good road feel. Glad that run flat is not mandated.,4
973,"I've had a number of sports cars over the years, including Corvettes, M3s and others. This thing is in a class by itself in terms of the cost/benefit equation. For street driving, it will do 95% of what those other cars will do, and at half the price. It gives me a big smile each time I drive it, and think about how little money I paid for the performance I'm getting. Highly recommended.",4
974,"We have owned this car for almost a year and are very pleased with it. We shopped for the Rav4, Equinox, etc but the CRV came out ahead. On a long trip recently, which included a mountain pass, we got 33 mpg! It's cute, handles well and is great in the snow and on ice. On the down side, the tires that come with it are garbage and several people have had to replace them after only one year, including us. The folding rear seats are a VERY poor design. They wad up behind the front seats and give you almost no extra room. Honda designers should take some tips from Rav4 rear seats and have them fold once, and completely flat. Also, the hatchback, when opened, can drip muddy snow and rain.",3
975,"So far I am very impressed with the car. I have had it 4 months and 4,400 miles. The power is fine. Gas mileage is great. I took a trip to the coast (1,200 miles), averaged 33.2 MPG. I do drve for economy with gas at $3.00. Hwy speed was 70-73 MPH and did some drafting.",4
976,"I've driven the XC90 for 20K+ miles still love it. Mileage is almost always over 20. Trips - Norway/Sweden 1,700 miles - 23.8 mpg. Upper Midwest 2,400 - 23.4 mpg. New England - 3,400 miles 23.7 mpg. Amazingly good mileage. Comfort can't be beat. Have had ZERO problems, not even one repair trip to the dealer. It will be a long time before I trade-in this car.",4
977,I am very happy with my car. It handles great and so far is quite dependable. Watch out for the trunk lid. I made the mistake of leaving it half way closed after getting something out of the trunk and I wound up killing the battery. When I purchased the car the one key didn't work. The dealership had to get the replacement from Mersedes and they told me it would have cost me $150. for me to buy one if it wasn't under warranty if say I lost mine. I haven't had any other problems so far.,3
978,Researched full size SUVs for 2 yrs and the hands down winner is the Armada. Great engine power & drivetrain that is silky smooth. Plenty of towing power with 317hp & AWD function. Very nice cabin touches with up to date technology & styling. The ride is stable and feels safe to haul family & friends. This SUV just looks so right coming down the road. Armada - Just what a full size SUV should be!,4
979,I was very impressed with the drivability of this car compared to the BMW and I'm looking forward to lower maintenance costs than my BMW or Audi. Comfy ride yet still good road feel so I know what's going on. Nice and quiet. Smooth transmission even with performance driving. Paddle shifters are convenient and give confidence when performance driving. Heated and cooled seats are very nice.,4
980,"We were looking for good gas mileage, the right price with optional 6 passenger seating when we spotted a 2008 Mazda 5. It is easy for the kids to open the sliding doors to get in and out. The second row seating is comfortable and has a great bin for toys and cups. Now I can pick up my friends kids or transport family when I need to. The Mazda 5 third row folds down so easily when not in use. I can't believe the ergonomic storage room . I bought a snow blower for my husband and there was no problem sliding it in the back of the car with room to spare. My 6'4 husband fits in the drivers seat but the glove box in the pass is tight. We are pleased with the overall performance of the 5.",4
981,"I have owned many GM cars including Buicks. My LaCrosse is the best yet. I like everything about it. I have everything on it except remote start and enjoy all features. The backing light warning feature is great, heated seats, sat. radio, etc. But I really must compliment GM on the OnStar feature. I love having the hands free phone, emergency help, door unlock service, and emails monthly from my car about its performance. OnStar makes me feel safer when I'm driving alone. Thanks for a great ride and driving experience.",4
982,"For the people that want a real truck this Ford F-450 is the one for you. The power this ford has is unbelievable, easy to drive, comfortable, you can sit in this truck for 14 hours and feel like you're ready to go again. Looks like a truck and drives like a car. I can haul a full load of horses in a live in trailer and not even know its behind me. For all you people that talk about the truck being too big buy a smaller one.",4
983,"Could not have chosen anything better at this point. Feels safe, drives beautifully, and looks like a Lexus GS. This is a great car!",4
984,"Have had nothing but issues. I take it in at least once a month to be fixed, mainly with Brakes and Power steering. Brakes replaced twice fixed four times. First set of brakes were replaced at 9,000 miles. Power steering sensor fixed once then replaced once because it would lock on me while Id drive. Feel very unsafe in this car. Dealership won't do anything for me. Trying to argue the MI Lemon Law with Pontiac Corp. Have also had issues with tire pressure. Let's just say, I will never get a GM again... doing everything I can to get out of this lease!!",0
985,"I've owned everything from Porsche 911 to the Cayenne Turbo, from Lexus SC430 to BMW 745i and Mercedes CLS. For the money this new AUDI ""Rocks"". Don't sell the 911 but for everyday zips to work this new A5 not only saves a little in gas but offers on nice comfortable ride. If you like all the bells with true performance then this car is for you and if your luck to own, you know what I mean. Thanks Audi!",3
986,"Our 5dr SL is a very comfortable car. The rear seat legroom is excellent! I really enjoy the smoothness of the CVT. The handling is surprising also. I'm used to driving high performance sports cars, and this vehicle makes me feel at home behind the wheel. BRAVO Nissan!",3
987,"I bought this Silverado classic ext cab 2wd in oct 06 for 25k. Trade value now is 6500. Two reasons, the first is the 4.3 vortec v-6. It is way underpowered. The transmission grinds and tries to shift too much between 35- 40 mph. I had the transmission replaced at 30 K (unacceptable). I wanted to give GM another shot after driving Fords for so long. I will not do it again. Vehicle rides good and I get about 17.5 mpg around town.",1
988,"Hung on to my Honda Accord V6 Coupe for as long as possible (wife, 2 small kids and an SUV). I was looking for a 4-dr sports sedan that offered sportiness, luxury, and room for 4. I set my sights on the G35x as well as the BMW3. Once I had a look at the new lines and interior of the 2007 G and took it for a test drive a clear winner was declared. The G35 offered nearly everything that the BMW 3s had with better reliability and for way less money - performance and value!! After 10 months, and 15,000 mi. I just can't say enough good things about this car - I'm too busy driving it.",4
989,"I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who is thinking about getting an SUV. This is my first SUV and I love the look and comfort of it. XM radio in the vehicle is a great feature that I can't believe I lived with out before. This is a very roomy vehicle, yet still very sporty looking.",4
990,"The absolute best truck on the market! Had my Sierra w/ All Terrain package for three weeks and at just under 3k miles, I couldn't be happier. Rides like a luxury car on the highway and an off-roader when needed. All Terrain package runs just under Denali as far as price but maintains more of the off- roader feel. Z71 package w/ 20"" chrome wheels, 5.3 liter V8, 2-tone leather seating, & much more. I am getting 20 to 21 mpg on hwy & 17 city! Not bad for a larger V8 that really isn't meant for fuel effiency. Overall, best truck on the market after extensive checking and I couldn't be happier. If you are looking for a real deal with a great feel do not stop short of at least drinving one!",4
991,"Surprise! Ford really means it when they say this car can beat the Camry and Accord. Don't take their word for it, give it a try. Eerily quiet, smooth, elegant interior with the leather package, smooth-shifting six- speed automatic, and decent fuel economy at 25 MPG in mixed driving with the V-6.",4
992,I love my Enclave but have had to have the overhead cams and head replaced in the engine. The engine light kept coming on and going off. I had it in the shop 4 times before Buick fessed up to a problem with the cam shaft being milled too much. As far as comfort and fun to drive I couldn't find anything better. I was afraid of buying a Buick and we will see if this major replacement will change my mind.,3
993,"I drove the car from Arizona to Mississippi and back. I got 24 to 30 MPG on the trip driving at an average speed of 75MPH on the interstate. I get 23 - 24 MPG driving around Phoenix on a daily basis. I love the torque. It is hard not to spin the tires from a full stop. I get some strange looks from the Mustang owners when that happens. I am 6'3"" and have lots of head room but I had to remove the center arm rest to make room for my elbows. Now there is a big hole in the console but I'm comfortable. The road noise is the one thing I wish was better. Thankfully Phoenix put rubberized asphalt on all the freeways. It is very fun to drive.",3
994,"I love my new civic. I had a 1997 civic, so the redesign was a fantastic improvement. It truly feels like a luxury vehicle, at half the price. The gas mileage is terrific, too. Be warned about buying one, the three dealerships I went to in the Orlando area printed out the Edmunds TMV info from this webpage, and would NOT go below that price. It's too popular to haggle, apparently.",3
995,"I own a 2008 maxima se. This is my second maxima, I had a 2001 and traded it. I love the comfort the style and I always get a nice comment on my maxima. I will have this maxima for a long time I finally got the loaded one.",3
996,"I was looking for a new car and just happened to stop in at the new dealership.Took a test drive and was taken hook, line and sinker. I wasn't even going to look at the Hyundai models.Honda, Toyota, Chevy and Ford were the only ones I had driven. Bought the car next day. Glad I stopped by.",3
997,"The fit, finish, controls and sound system are excellent. I was initially disappointed with town mileage (17- 19 mpg), but it was winter and the car was new. The occasional use of AWD was handy. At 2500 miles I took a trip to Florida, got 26.1 mpg. The transmission would downshift twice climbing some of the overpasses on I- 75, to maintain the 75 mph speed limit. At 7500 miles, a trip to south dakota and colorado, got 28.2 mpg (I hung a sign, ""60 mph"" in the back window. Worked okay on the interstate). The wagon held all my gear (camping), and the (2-wheel) bike module is quite stable, although I took a folding stepstool to ease its use. After 14,000 miles it gets 20-21 around town.",3
998,"My CX-9 is certainly a solid, smooth driving vehicle. I've had it since April 07 and have discovered what an excellent vehicle I purchased. It handles on par with much sportier cars, has good power; pickup and corners unlike my expectations for a rather large, over 5,000 pound vehicle. The interior is understated, yet sleek and quietly upscale. The front seats do a fine job of keeping your backside centered even during hard cornering. The engine is powerful and smooth; mated to the six speed transmission, driving around town or on the highways is very pleasant.",3
999,"Traded in a 2001 BMW 740iL that had 80K. I got fed up with the Bimmers cheap plastic parts and frequent broken parts. I wanted to buy an American car to replace it. I drove a Mercury Sable (wife felt the seats were too short and steering wheel was too close to dash. The Impala didn't have much rear leg room so we test drove a charger. It had decient rear leg room and looked like a younger persons car(I'm 42 and not ready for a crown vic) I got the 5.7 Hemi with the 29R performance package. I really like this car. We got the My Gig with NAV and bluetooth, Sirius TV and Radio and the rear seat TV. This car has more features than the BMW and guess what, they all work, The sport seats look great",3
1000,I drive a lot. I have about 12000 miles on my Jetta and I only bought it in January. I went with the wolfsburg and it has everything that I wanted in a car.,4
1001,"Nice truck for the money. I was looking at Tundras but couldnt beat the price with the Silverado. Not a bad truck but it does have some annoying issues. Fit and finish is poor in my opinion. I am very picky about my vehicles and do not like dash rattles and seat squeaks. I have already had the wheel flares replaced due to defective paint, the rear window has been replaced due to the defrost lines not working. It has the typical dash, seat and door rattles and squeaks. This is annoying on a brand new truck with only 10k miles on it. I wouldnt discourage anyone from buying one, but just beware that no vehicle is perfect and this one has its fair share of problems.",2
1002,"I am very particular about cars and this Civic exceeds my expectations. I opted for the EX L with a manual transmission and absolutely love it. Interior is very nice especially compared to the other cars I've owned and the ones I test drove before purchasing this one. Stereo has a nice sound, seats are super comfortable-love the wrap around feature. Easy for me to get in and out of the car. Like the button that remotely pops trunk. Manual transmission is smooth. Steering is nice and easy. Handles corners well. Fold down rear seats are great. For the price, this is an excellent car and value. If you want BMW features then you will have to pay a BMW price.",3
1003,"We picked up our sunburst yellow Sky the last day of April. All I can say is wow. I love this car. Everyone notice's it, and wants to ask questions. Everyone stares at it. I get about 40 MPG ( Canadian ) on the highway and mabey 30 city with just over 5000 km on the odometer. There are a few things that need to be changed in my mind. The switchs for the power windows are difficult to reach as is the hand brake. The ride is comfortable, having drove for 3 and a half hours strait was no problem. Lots of power and enough trunk space ( if you can travel light and don't mind washing your clothes to go away for a week ) we did.",4
1004,"I cannot believe the quality for the price. The car is almost perfect, its extremely roomy and comfy inside, runs quiet and smooth and is super fun to drive with hands down the best turning radius of all time. I have gotten between 37-40 MPG on each tank with a 50/50 combo of city/freeway driving, except on one tank I got 35 with 5 people in the car the whole way. I haven't had it long enough to really judge reliability, but having just gotten rid of a lemon, I know what bad quality feels like, and this is a different world. Love this car!",4
1005,"I love my Fit! I live in the city, and the Fit's small size makes parking a breeze. But, I'm also a performer and I need to haul all manner of costumes, props and set pieces to and from shows. Despite the Fit's deceptively small exterior, I can pack a TON into the back. And, when I'm not hauling a full load of cargo, my two dogs and I pile in and we can zip around town. My only criticism is in regards to gas mileage. I've never achieved the 31-38 mpg range advertised. I average about 26 mpg in the city and (if I'm lucky!) 30 mpg on the highway. Other than that- no complaints at all!",4
1006,"I have owned GM vehicles for 15 years now and this is by far the best I have ever had. I owned mostly 2 Chevys until this one. Looked for over 5 months and compared the Tahoe, Ford and Yukon and it was not close. The Yukon just looked and felt better. I saw the Yukon on the road and it always made me stop and look. Gas is hard, but it is for everyone right now. Only complaint I have is the folding 3rd row seat. Don't know if it is just mine but it is difficult to move and almost impossible to replace is removed. Should have looked at power seats there.",3
1007,"This car is amazing. I owned a Cadillac before, and thought I would be disappointed, but its a lot of fun and drives great. I have been rearended by a heavy duty truck, and hit a deer at 50 mph - not a single scratch on the car. It's very reliable and takes a lot of abuse. It's the best car I have ever owned. I would highly suggest it to anyone. It's definitely a headturner, and unique, which were big pluses for me.",4
1008,"I took an Acadia home overnight and after nearly 150 miles I could tell it was nowhere near the advertised mileage. I drove a similarly equipped Edge and thought for approximately $2K less it was the better of the two vehicles. The transmission is smoother and even though it doesn't shift up and down with the buttons the engine braking feature on O/D lockout is much better than on older Ford vehicles. The vehicle is fun to drive, and has a much more comfortable driving postion over my Honda Pilot, thanks to a more comfortable seat and the telescoping wheel. I was getting over 26 MPG on a trip on the interstate and am getting around 21-22 on the mountainous roads I drive daily to work",3
1009,"I am very impressed with this car. It's the most comfortable car I've ever driven (most recent cars were Passat & Murano). Very elegant, simplistic interior, eye-catching exterior and solid construction. My only complaint so far is the fuel consumption (20 mpg avg - high for a V6)",3
1010,This is my first SUV and I have test driven plenty of them. The design of this vehicle is awesome. Although the mileage is not that great it does very well on the highway. If you haven't purchased one yet get out and get one.,4
1011,"This was the first vehicle I test drove when I started car shopping - after no less than 10 vehicles later I returned to buy this awesome car! A practical indulgence - a hardtop sedan when the weather is bad and a convertible when the sun is out. Mine is all but totally loaded with the exception of a navigation system & ultra-prem leather which seems nearly impossible to find - I couldn't be more thrilled. With 2 hours in daily commute time, the ride is luxurious and fun to the point I don't want to leave the vehicle. All I can say is that if you see one on a Volvo lot snap it up ASAP - you won't regret it! Safety, style and fun all rolled up into one great vehicle.",4
1012,"I think Ford has done a good job on this car. It is fun to drive, handles very well, Comfort level is good. A very good road car. I haven't had any problems with my brakes, but I don't tailgate either.",3
1013,"I sold my Prius to take advantage of the ca hov sticker value. Bought the versa as a ""bridge"" car until the electric hybrid comes along (hopefully). Am not disappointed. Am getting about 30 mpg combined, which is good as I drive a lot of country and hilly roads. Quiet ride. Love that the seats go flat for hauling items. Got it loaded for under 12,000. Did well in the high mountains on a recent road trip - enough power to feel confident on a crowded freeway. BASIC interior inoffensive. Negatives - need more storage spaces in front and cup holders are cramped. Radio is difficult to tune to new stations. That's about it. Wish it got 45 mpg... Ah, well.",3
1014,"17K, add engine oil light came on. Noted to be 2 qts low. Thought this was odd since too new for this to occur. 22K, light came on again. Dealer stated ""not uncommon to burn thru a quart or 2 in the break in period. Funny. Light has come on at least 8 times. Burned thru 12+ qts in the past 10K. Dealer has done pressure test, die test (although they never finalized procedure as they claimed they did), checked valve springs for knicks (according to TSB). No oil coming out of tailpipe and no leaks what so ever. Dealer keeps telling me to put on more miles. No resolution to date. I'm done! Have seen others with same problem on the web. Do not recommend this vehicle & MPG stinks",1
1015,"Traded a 2003 Maxima which I was sad to trade in... solid, fast, dependable and the last Japanese built. The 2008 SE however is also powerful and an excellent freeway cruiser. Quiet, solid, and quick. Around town however it can feel over weight and lumbering. CVT took some getting accustomed to but now love it. No downshift lag when passing... just hit the gas and ZOOM! Now driving a typical ""automatic"" feels old school with all that engine revving up then down with each shift. Some interior materials feel a bit cheap which was a disappointment. Overall satisfied and will probably keep for 4 years then trade for 2012 Maxima. As my title states, once a Maxima owner, always a Maxima owner.",3
1016,"Transmission hesitation/performance is a glaring design issue. At times the tranny acts as it doesn't know what gear it is suppose to be in. Which negatively effects MPG. Currently gettng 14-15 city and 16-18 highway. Dealer installed software update but no help. Another update is available but told it would cost me 3-4 MPG and once installed ut can't be backed out! Have had 9 other Buicks and loved them all. This car, once you look past its beauty is a big dissappointment. Would not recommend until GM permanently fixes the tranny issues. Dealer does acknowledge this is an issue.",1
1017,"I wanted an suv that had plenty of room and was safe for my toddler son. After test driving my Armada I knew it was perfect. It is much more accessible than a Tahoe or Yukon. I read many reviews on here to see what everyone else had to say about the Armada and realized that gas was the biggest concern. Safety was my biggest issue so we went ahead and purchased it and are happy that it gets 17 miles to the gallon in the city. It is as big as a house, we have room for days, and the gas mileage is not much worse than a midsize. I am glad I chose an Armada.",3
1018,"I have owned this just about a month, and can't believe how much money I have already saved! Can't beat it, Great MPG: 38 hiway, 33 city so far, great trunk space than orginally thought, enough pep, seats are more comfortable..and I got the manual which I had not driven in over 20 years, and was very comfortable. I would recommend this as a good value for the money. Looked at Astra, but would have spent extra 4k. Only con, maybe more nooks and crannies, for little things i.e coins, sunglasses, etc. Other than that very, very happy with this purchase. And even enough back seat room in 4dr sedan!",3
1019,"The 2007 Eclipse Spyder is fun to drive. Yes it's not a pure sports car, at the same time it is more functional for everyday use more than the ""pure sports car.""",3
1020,"I'll start this by saying I'm an auto dealer and have owned many different trucks. I have an 08 F150 XLT with the FX2 front end. It has the 5.4 V8 which is a great workhorse for longevity and strength. It tows my 10,400 ib. trailer like its not behind me. The only aftermarket performance parts are a Volant cold air intake and Flowmaster exhaust. I get between 16- 17mpg in town and 21 on the highway with cruise. My business partner has an 05 F150 FX4 with 201,000 miles on his 5.4. First engine and transmission. They are definitely built Ford tough. Just run synthetic fluids and keep out of the throttle. By far the strongest, most comfortable, most practical truck out there.",4
1021,"I had a 2002 Jetta with 59,000 miles on it and the performance was great, able to handle the highway without loosing any grip. I bought a 2008 Passat Lux. I needed leg room and performance with an economy niche to it. This Passat is better looking than the Lexus. I have received more compliments on this vehicle style, color, and performance. I needed a good running car with a slight luxury texture that is not expensive in maintenance. VW designed the perfect car for me. Thanks VW.",4
1022,"While the 3.0R boasts a larger engine and more hp, it actually has less lb/foot of torque than its 2.5GT counterpart; translating to 7 tenths of a second from 0-60. The acclaimed S/I drive is amusing, if not practical. In sport mode acceleration is noticeably boosted from intelligent mode. Paddle-shifting is also available in sport sharp, though its more burdensome than liberating. Paddle-shift levers, S/I drive console, and Navigation system all contribute to the impressive interior. Even after the romance fades, the controls are insightful and convenient. This car may be your best choice if: a. you drive in all-weather conditions b. you purchase used at a discount",3
1023,"Had vehicle about 2 months and satisfied. Was concerned about the CVT but so far no problem. Drove up to Yellowstone and back and got an amazing 34 mpg. Usually get about 26-27 driving around our local area. Paid between 25 and 26K for a loaded awd SL. Leather, Bose, sunroof, Intellikey etc. Very comfortable and large enough to do the job but small enough to be fuel efficient. We have a 3/4 ton 4WD suburban also but it only gets about 13-14 mpg so it sits in the back yard most of the time now. I have been a Honda liker and tried the CRV. Did not like the way the CRV handled, it seemed rather squirrelly to me at highway speeds whereas the Rogue runs straight and true.",3
1024,"After reading many conflicting reviews about space for taller drivers I decided to test drive one to see if I'd 'fit' (sorry). To my surprise I had plenty of room, just as much leg room and lots more head room than my '97 Grand Prix. I'm 6'6"" and 280+ w/ size 14 feet. I had no problems whatsoever with the pedals being too close to me or each other (in both the manual and the auto). The steering wheel does not feel too far away to me, in my normal driving position, my arms are still slightly bent, but if I want to feel ""racy"" I can press my back into the seat and feel like I'm driving a race car with my arms stretched out. It's got plenty of pep for a car of its class.",3
1025,"The Tundra is an excellent truck. Power, durability, comfort, and all the works. A true truck man love those qualities. The Tundra is not a Lexus but it sure rides like one. I can't wait to see if TRD creates a blower (forced induction) for this vehicle. It will really become a true monster truck that is street legal. I love everything about my Tundra. What a truck!!",4

Short, crackle sound, right side speaker don't work. Who knows where water is traveling now! Also, when driving can hear wind through windshield. Hard to see through rear window with rear back seats up, don't use it.I can't really rate the vehicle to much, since it's only been a month, so far not good.",1
1027,Approx. three weeks after receiving vehicle it started to hesitate periodically. After documenting fuel- ups and problem occurrences I brought it to the dealership. Was told I probably topped it off. I probably did. Not an issue with my four previous GTI's. Dealership replaced a faulty charcoal canister unit and purge valve. Was given a rental. They were excellent. Filled it up today. (Repaired on 4/28/08) Engine malfunction light never went on. Will see what happens this weekend.,2
1028,"I purchased a 2007R/T in Feb. A manager was driving it. It has 6700 on it now. It. Making a chattering noise from the front end. At times it seems to get louder. Two dealerships called Chrysler and they know about the problem? But they don't what it is and they don't know how to fix it? They say it is safe to drive? How do they know if they don't know what's wrong, or fixing it?",1
1029,"Bought this car to advertise my business, can't miss it! Everything else is a bonus, goes up Vail pass very fast, fuel average has yet to drop below 28.6 mpg- better than advertised. 1st car I have ever owned that does not need snow tires and we get 200+ inches a year here. (traction control that works) hauls kids, adults, groceries, skis, you name it. The instruments in the center are much easier to read than the regular kind.",4
1030,"We commute short distances but like to take multi-state road trips. The Impala fits in the garage and budget but flies down the highway without any strain. XM radio and OnStar's navigation are great over the road tools. Finding an E-85 station is particularly cool using OnStar. The hidden storage under the back seat is nice for the lap top rather than in the trunk. All the trip computer readouts are nice when the scenery gets boring. We also considered the new Malibu but tiny things like the 2-zone A/C and power passenger seat ruled the day. A couple of small items would have been nice, memory settings for the seat/mirrors and a wider choice of wheels. Thank goodness for TireRack!",3
1031,"I drive a lot. On average, I spend about 50 minutes in my car daily. I'm currently at 25,000 miles on my '06 Jetta. It's been a year since I purchased my spice red Volkswagen Jetta and I'm still very pleased with my decision. Although it was not my first choice, I find it to be a beautiful car that is strong and enjoyable. On a separate note, the dealership is not as helpful. It is the only dealership that offers Jettas in my area, so I have no choice. The service department has been very rude to me on one issue. Still, overall I love my car. ;)",3
1032,"I have had the Saturn for about 6 weeks now and have been quite pleased with all the features. Fuel economy is pretty good for a 6. Road noise is minimal. Heated seats and remote start are a nice add on. Heard several comments, That's a Saturn? Wow",3

Because I rarely used the 4WD I opted for the 2WD this time. I am very happy with my choice. I got a very good deal at the Dealership (a lost leader deal). With the 4.7 eng I get 20 MPG on the hi-way and it is still new. Off the line it keeps pace with the Hemi, but the Hemi is superior at higher speeds for raw get up and go. Never the less the 4.7 seems to be more than adequate. This revamped model seems to have ironed out the product line's prior deficiencies. It seems to be a very good value.",3
1034,"I could not be happier after living with this car for 9 months. Performance and comfort is exceptional. Great gas mileage (34MPG) with more than enough HP. Fun to drive, Everything works the way its supposed to. I would definitely buy again.",4
1035,"Replaced my 300C with the Aspen.Definitely a better fit for a family who doesn't want to go minivan crazy! Seats adults and kids comfortably and makes its presence known on the road. Although the Aspen comes with some pretty cool standard features, only adding minor upgrades has been hard to deal with after the purchase (Nav. and entertainment system would have made this a nicer buy). Chrysler should also think about moving the body style further away from the Durango..I know as an Aspen owner I get a little peeved when people say, ""oh, you went and got the Durango?"" - NO! Overall, it's a sweet ride.",3
1036,More power than I know what to do with! Problem is with all that power the gas mileage is terrible. The fit and finish is near perfect for a pick-up. The interior is maybe a little too good to take to a job site.,2
1037,"I have had three different cars so far in my life, and I can say that this car is worth a lot more than I paid for it. My monthly payments are only $200 a month, and I get 30 MPG. I have never felt so grateful to have a car, and I have never ever felt this safe, and comfortable in a car. Not to mention, I have never had a car so luxurious (and I don't even have the model that's been supped-up). The basic model is already equipped as a luxury car. OnStar is amazing and comes standard, and I have a car phone which makes me feel safe. It has a 5 star frontal, and side crash test rating. I will probably own another one of these in the future.",4
1038,"Unbelievable! Who needs the bmw 3, A4, or MB c class. This car looks amazing, it drives likes its got attitude. I have the 304 hp model with rear wheel dr. Fully loaded with the luxury package and navigation. The only thing this car is missing is blue tooth. there is zero road noise, you can only hear the engine at higher revs.",4
1039,"Car magazines under rate this car, while owners rave about them.Lets start with the outstanding good looks of the vehicle, no other car can compare to it for looks. So I would advise those who test these cars to ""look again"" and rate them more fairly. If you had to buy a car for your own use you would want one of these.",4
1040,"We bought our Honda Civic on April 2008. Since that time I am trying to calculate the miles on the each tank. But I never got more than 23 miles average MPG with the mixed driving in city and highway. I cannot believe that someone gets more than 28 miles MPG. The interior is fine except the place for speedometer. The starting of movement is fine. I can get 40-45 miles per hour when RPM under 1700. The exterior is really nice. The car is wonderful for a small family. I could get 32 miles MPG just on highway, but I never got 38 miles MPG on highway, it is unrealistic. Even I have a hard foot, I think that I could get more MPG than I have now. I made 7600 miles and generally OK with the Civic.",2
1041,"I Have no regrets about buying this car except some disappointment that the manual transmission gets a little worse fuel mileage than the automatic. I think a six spd. manual would be nice, but I realize few people who buy Camrys buy manuals.",3
1042,"Ordered car in June last year. Waited and waited and car came in April. I am glad I waited for this car. Fit, style, paint, all TOP NOTCH!!! Shifts smooth and clean. Runs just fine and even better than I thought for a 4 cyl. Recomend manual, gives the car a bit more pep. Top works realively easily and wife can handle with no trouble. Trunk space small, but expected. I did get my golf bag in with top up. So far I give GM and Saturn an A++++ on this roadster! The new supercharged SKY should give it a bit more perfomance, but I am well satisfied. As I put on more miles I will update the review. For now -- GREAT!!",4
1043,"I absolutely love this car! I owned a Honda civic ex prior to this car, and it served me well, but I felt it time to change to something that sits higher. Now on to the cool stuff - very impressed with the interior space, as were my 6'3"" friends! - drove 18 days on one tank of gas (just under 400 miles) and despite some high winds last weekend, I felt secure on the road. The blue tooth, keyless entry is a big plus -",4
1044,"Did my research on Edmunds customer reviews and the Passat had consistent stellar reviews. Considered Honda, Subaru, Volvo but kept going back to the Passat. Wanted something sporty, family friendly, and decent gas mileage and Passat won me over. The Passat is quick and a blast to drive! We have a SUV for family trips and a luxury Japanese sedan but we seem to always take out the VW! A little expensive than other brands but a little negotiating can put you at the same price range for a better car.",3
1045,Have owned the '07 Patriot since April. Was the last one on the lot for '07s. Got good deal. Did a lot of reading before test driving. Was looking for a more economical vehicle- still have Dodge Dakota Quad V8 but it sits in the driveway most of the time. Kept it to haul trailer & boat. Got the fully loaded version. Seats are very comfortable-both my husband and I have bad backs and have yet experienced any problems. Drive city & highway-have just got to 3000 miles and am getting 22-26 mpg. CVT took some time getting use to-really like the fact that you can't feel the gears change.,3
1046,"My Acadia drives wonderfully, better than the other 2 SUVs I have owned. I love the body style the the fule mileage is great for the size of the SUV",3
1047,"Interior is novel, only seen in very high cost vehicles. Can hold 4, 230lbs adults comfortably with leg room in rear seating. Exterior is extremly sharp, excellent paint and tight seems. Windows developed to reduce cabin noise. Exterior lights very attractive and new. Doors shut with good sound meaning well built. Blinkers built into front fenders for warning other vehicle on road of lane changes and turns. Air bags in sides of car a plus for my 16 year old driver. Plus extra steel cage built into cage of vehicle. Probably built safer than any car at or near it's price range. 17inch wheels make this car look sharp.",3
1048,"We previously owned a Jeep Liberty and had to upgrade in size. The Liberty was a great Jeep, so we decided to stay in the Jeep family. For a family of four, the Commander has been awesome. The kids love riding in the third row because their feet reach the floor - only suitable for little ones because there's no leg room. The front is very spacious and controls are easily accessible to both the driver and passenger. I don't much care that there isn't much storage behind the third row when it's up, but it wasn't a deal breaker by any means. We look forward to our road trip next month because we'll have plenty of room for comfort and storage. Overall we are very pleased with this vehicle.",3
1049,"Overall I am having a great experience driving the Mazda3s GT. It truly does want to zoom-zoom. I love the car. The only negative is that it is hard to read the instrument dials in bright sunshine. I cannot rate the reliability as I bought the car new, but I am counting on it lasting many years.",3
1050,"Have had car two weeks not really tested it yet. This is good, my wife likes car not sure she gets my desire for a V8. No complaints, however I can't find 11 speakers I can only find 9. Some problem huh. lol. I drive about 35,000 miles a year so I will know soon.",3
1051,"My Saturn Astra is my first car and I'm extremely happy with it. I like the European look and that the 3 door model isn't as popular as other cars in its class yet. I got an amazing deal on it because the dealership was cleaning out all the '08's. I saved about $7000 and got my windows tinted for half price. Other cars I was considering were Pontiac G5, Mazda 3, Honda Civic, Hyundai Accent and Ford Focus.",4
1052,"I did a lot of research before buying, looked at all the players in the full size truck market and decided on the Tundra. The others couldn't touch the styling and reliability of Toyota. Getting 15 mpg so far but only on the second tank of gas. This truck drives and handles great, excellent comfort and no road noise. I love this truck!!",4
1053,"Yukon has exceeded my expectations in most areas save one. The engine idle is the roughest, most annoying setup I have ever experienced. If you aren't moving, the engine idle will pitch and buck the truck giving the sensation of a coffee percolator. Too bad GM refuses to acknowledge the problem. It seems to me that a software upgrade would take care of the problem. That issue aside, this truck handles like a much smaller vehicle. Easy to steer around corners, good sight lines and excellent seating height. Fuel milage has been 16-17 mpg/city and 21-24 mpg/hwy. Pretty good in my book for a 320 hp/V8.",3
1054,"I like this car. It is my 5th Honda. I previously had a prelude. My only issue with the civic is that is doesn't ride as smooth as my prelude. It is a little higher up, so doesn't hug the road as well. All in all I am happy with the car, its very sporty looking.",3
1055,"I got a 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix GT in white with the tan leather interior with only 27,000 miles for a first car (You'd say spoiled brat, but let me just say I got a hell of a deal!). My siblings who drive Hondas say it's incredible. The ride is smooth, it's extremely comfortable with tons of legroom, the Monsoon sound system is insane, and this thing is FAST. I am in love with this car. There is not one thing more I could wish for, I swear. If you are looking for car, take a look at the Grand Prix. The ratings I gave it are honest, this thing is more fun to drive than my moms Mustang GT. And whoever says there's no back seat room has gone mad.",4
1056,"My previous model ESV 2004, had features that I felt made it a luxury vehicle. The 2008 seats are hard, do not hold you in position when cornering. The sun visor is poor. Previous model had more flexibility. Headrest ability to bend forward is now seriously lacking. I happened apparently to be one of the few people that used the disc changer system under random ALL. Since the addition of the backup camera this feature has been removed. This last item damed near stopped the purchase. I now wish that I had purchased a Mercedes GL 550. Which at this point in time will be my next purchase; and most likely sooner than later. This is my 10th new Cadillac purchase in a row.",1
1057,"This is the second Jeep I have owned. By far the best ride, but there are too many Plastic parts (i. e. the skid plate, grill, and door interior). I improved my mileage by 3 mpg and horsepower by 23 with after market products. Great off road performance. A joy to drive.",3
1058,"I just bought my EX35 a few hours ago after spending 3 weeks test driving EVERY comparably-priced luxury cross-over (Volvo XC60, Audi Q5, BMW X3, Acura RDX). I also test drove the Honda CR-V for the practical side of me looking to save a bundle. All in all, I know I may not have the most ""seasoned"" review, but I can say that I do not have buyer's remorse in the slightest! I came out of a '01 Toyota Rav4, very dependable and practical for my needs at the time, so the EX35 was a steal (besides, my car was a total loss after a wreck and I needed new wheels)! I walked in, test drove an EX35 and loved the smooth ride and quiet interior almost immediately. The huge savings sweetened the deal!",4
1059,"I bought my Optima EX V6 this month and it's VERY nice. Leather seats, Infinity audio system w/6 CD, mp3 plugin. Got the electronic stability package and the premium package. Drives and handles much nicer than my Ford Taurus. Surprisingly smooth ride on freeways and in town. Auto air keeps the interior at a constant 72 degrees (adjustable of course). Night driving, dash lights (soft blue) are admirable and well laid out. Easy to see or disregard when concentrating on driving. Average 33 mpg! 27 mpg when using the 5 speed Sportmatic transmission (FUN FUN FUN). It feels like a ""Drive by wire"" car. Pearl White turns heads. Air bags galore. Safe 5*.",4
1060,"After extensively researching/testing alternatives in this class, we skeptically decided to stop and test the all new Saturn Aura. We were shocked by the value as well as the sporty driving dynamics. We have approx 1500 miles on the car and are still impressed with the comfort, interior quietness, styling, and overall package. Mileage is mid 20's with mostly mixed driving. After owning Hondas, we feel that GM has finally delivered a competitive product at an approx $2-3K discount. Would highly recommend checking this out before purchasing another vehicle in this class.",4
1061,"I have been researching cars for about 7 months. I was looking at this, an accord coupe, a g6 gt, and mini cooper s, and so on. I knew that whatever car I got into I would be happy with and I feel content with my lease. I am about to graduate from college and got a great job, so this is my first car in my name. Big experience for me. I am such a car guy so I put a lot of time into this and found that rating for rating, pound for pound, dollar for dollar, i made the right choice.",4
1062,"Needed a 4 door wagon due to the new addition to my family. So I test drove an Audi A4 Avant (2.0T and 3.2 versions) and the Subaru Outback 3.0R was on par with the Audi Avant 3.2. Went with Subaru and saved $14K over the Audi. Also, plan to do a lot of outdoor family stuff (biking, camping, etc) so the additional ride height with the Outback made sense. I still have yet to open it up cause it's still in the break-in period, but this an excellent overall value. This car feels like I'm still driving my BMW. Subaru got this Outback right. Can't go wrong with Japanese build quality and a German driving feel at a Japanese price tag.",3
1063,"Got the car last week. I love it, it is so much fun to drive. I also love that you don't see many on the street so you find people looking at your car wondering what it is. It has the perfect balance of a sports car and yet keeps the sophisticated feel of a Volvo. Much better buy than other cars in its class such as the volvo GTI, Civic SI, Mazda Speed 3, or Mini Cooper S. Test drove the rest and thought this one was the best choice.",3
1064,"I narrowed my choices to the 2008 Vue and Rav4 months before they hit the lots, test-driving them both the same day. I'd also narrowed my choices between Toyota & Saturn 10 yrs earlier when I bought a Saturn SC2, and for pretty much the same reasons the Vue was an easy choice. Saturn makes good-looking vehicles w/superior color choices, that come well-equipped with lots of luxuries that make them especially fun to drive. I was impressed with its nimble handling, tight steering and solid stability at cornering. The 4000-pound 6cyl can haul 3500 lbs. Between OnStar and standard alarm, it's safer from theft. I upgraded to the premium package, and now own one stellar car.",4
1065,The car is beautiful and fun to drive. Everyone I meet loves the car instantly. I recommend this car for anyone who loves to drive!,4
1066,"Sky is a hoot to drive, an aboslute joy. It does turn heads and draws a lot of attention, not for shy people. Power is acceptable, interior quality OK, seats are great. It is just like the commercial ""That is a Saturn""?",4
1067,"This is my very first ""new"" car and it's a long time waiting. I wanted a small sports car; either the Mini Cooper or the GTI fit my style. I ended up picking the GTI because I felt the flood of Minis out there on the street would dilute my enthusiasm for my car. I am extremely happy with my purchase an happy I chose this over the Cooper.",3
1068,"I've only had it a month, but I'm in love with this truck. The V6 is really peppy and overall the vehicle drives and rides great. Build quality appears to be really solid and is what I'm used to in a Toyota. I like the design and features of the interior and the seats are nice and comfy.",3
1069,"Got the Hemi (MDS)... We love this vehicle. Does everything expected, well. Drives, handles, hauls... no complaints other than the gas mileage. But what large SUV gets good gas mileage. Very happy with this buy!",4
1070,"Gas mileage is great. Small size for easy city/tight spot parking, yet spacious inside. Has a luxurious feeling to it inside. I got the LE fully equipped: ABS, EBD, curtain airbags for rear, cruise control. Acceleration is a bit disappointing on highway, but once cruise speed is attained has no problem reaching 90 mph, and sounds and feels quite smooth.",3
1071,"I just came back to Chevrolet after owning two Volks (a 1999 Passat and a 2006 Jetta, previous to the Passat I owned a Cavalier Z24) and it's just an amazing car. The 4 cylinder is just enough power, the ride is smooth but firm, very close to a Volks. It is incredibly quiet in the car, the seats are very comfortable and look great with the suede and leather. Great job GM!",4
1072,"Come on! People are comparing this car to a restored 85 civic for fuel economy. It may be true that the civic gets better mileage but how much fun is a 1985 civic to drive? I first saw this car in Italy and could not wait to get one. I have seen, studied, drove and read all the available info. This car is designed well and is fun! Sure, it could use better gas mileage, a smoother transmission and longer warranty , but what car is absolutely perfect at this price level? As stated: ""The smile factor"" is what makes this car a pleasure to own. This will be a second runabout vehicle for me in the city. Can't wait to get mine.",3
1073,"This is my 2nd Tacoma and 4th Toyota. I knew this was the only truck I was going to buy the only thing was to decide a color (black). There is a lot of storage. The storage under and behind the rear seats is beyond great. The composite bed is much needed. Although it can be slick. The engine power is excellent and after 17K miles I get 21 hwy and 18 mixed driving. I have no complaints except the paint scratches very easy. Toyota needs to address this along with the 17"" sport wheels that have a pitting problem in the finish.",3
1074,"It took me 3 weeks to locate a black GT. It was definitely worth the wait. This car is the most versatile car out there. Below 3000rpm it is about equal to a Mazda 3. Then the turbo kicks in. It is a rocket sled. The WRX is more expensive with less power. The cobalt is cheaper and looks and handles cheaper. The G35 is nice but too pricey. To put this much power into a front wheel drive and make it work is an engineering marvel. The interior design is slick as well, the suspension is tight, and I love the headlight beam adjustment control option. The Bose system is very nice, and there is the midi port for mp3 players as well. The hatchback feature also gives it a lot of cargo room",3
1075,"Keeping in mind that no car is perfect, I'm not scoring a 10. This is my daily driver, commuter and grocery getter, it will be driven all year round (don't get any snow here) my baby girl's car seat is permanently secured in the passenger seat. The 2.0 has plenty of power, but the car is not ""fast"" by any means. However, it can change direction faster than most cars, and this is where the MX-5 shines. Very nimble out of the box, it handles just great. A little bit more body roll than I'd like though. Lightweight, 50/50 weight distribution, double wishbone suspension, sticky tires, rear wheel drive. Close ratio manual 6 speed; a true sportscar.",3
1076,Just picked up my 2007 Limited on Friday. I couldn't be happier with this car. All the comfort and feel of a high end Lexus for 2/3 the price. I couldn't be happier. I traded in a fully loaded 2004 Camry (which was a very nice car) for this fully loaded Avalon and the difference is unbelievable. A nice comfortable ride. Audio system is top of the line.,4
1077,"I just traded my beloved 05 WRX wagon in due to a foot injury that made shifting the manual trans difficult. I was looking at the 6-cyl 3.0R model, then I drove it... really slow! The 2.5GT was quite a bit faster but still much slower than my WRX. Ah well, the Legacy IS a heavier car and it has an auto trans. I do like the 5-speed auto for what it's worth, and the paddle shifters are a cool touch. The SI-Drive feature is a bit gimmicky really, as the three different maps aren't too much different. You still need to put your foot down to get good speed with the Sport Sharp mode. Interior quality is top-notch and the ride is smooth and quiet otherwise. Happy to own my second Subie!",3
1078,We had an 07 tC and traded it in for the 08 xB. Lots of room for every one. Handles very well and I can not tell much difference in power from the tC to the xB.,3
1079,"Well I originally wanted to purchase a two year old Audi A4. It would be in the price range I was looking for. I came across the Jetta and actually thought it was the Audi. Doing some homework on the Jetta revealed that it has one of the highest safety ratings, is a cousin of the A4 and is an overall excellent value. The Jettas prior to 2008 were more expensive and was not crazy about the wheels and tail lamps. 2008 VW changed them and lowered the price. I now own my Jetta and get compliments everywhere I go!! The car has almost every option I could need and it only cost me $20,500. every car in its class doesn't even come close to the Jetta in Value. AND it's German..",4
1080,"I love this SUV! This is my first vehicle purchase. I was driving a '93 Suburban, and this is a great improvement! Great gas mileage, love the interior. Only problems I have had, was, I wasn't aware you needed to ask if a vehicle came with cruise control, I just thought it was a standard feature. I mean, it came with the Stability Control System, but no cruise control. That would have been a selling point for me. Also I was sold the vehicle as a 6 CD player, but it is only a single, no biggie, but why the need for a load button if you can only do one CD at a time?",3
1081,"Poor handling at high speed. Car shakes at high speed. Car seems to float at 80 mph. Very top heavy in curves. Car tight into curves, loose in the center and loose out of curves. Car performance seems to go away during after being driven through out day. Low gear is too high, poor performance at start. A/C fan blower very low. Door locks should lock when car is in gear.",1
1082,"Had a Sequoia before the 2007 RX 350 AWD and I loved it. I sometimes miss the capacity of the Sequoia, but the RX 350 is such a great car, I'm over it in no time! This car is so generously appointed and capable, I seriously sometimes forget I have to drive it... it does everything else for me. I got everything on it except the DVD system and I'm still learning cool stuff it does. I test drove many cars before deciding on this one and for the money, there is nothing better out there. Actually, nothing even came close.",4
1083,"I have had my eyes on this car for the past 3 month, I bought it home with me to many oohhhhs and aaaaahhhh from my family member. When you lay eyes on the Scion from the outside it is TINY, but when you step in it's like magic the inter room is amazing! It felt like I was driving a minivan! Everything is perfect on the car. The only, and I mean the only, complaint is that there is no armrest in the front. Since I bought the car I have been looking for excuses to run errands and go to work, just anything that will let me drive the car. It is an amazing car.",4
1084,"I traded in my 2005 Toyota Scion TC and said I would NEVER get anything but a toyota ever. WELL, I saw the C30, test drove it, fell in love and signed that day. It was one of those vehicles that you cant wait to get ahold of. Had a slight problem with the window gear but it was fixed right away. I feel safe and secure while driving and can ""beat"" most any car that even dares to try and race me :) It's small, unique, cute, fast and reliable. Every where I go, people ask what I'm driving and want a ride. I feel amazing knowing I haven't seen one of the C30's on the road since I first noticed them back in January!!",4
1085,"Had owned a 2002 Mazda Protege ES. That car was such a well controlled handler, but was starting to get too punishing on midwestern roads hammered by a hard winter. The 08 Mazda6 is almost as fun to whip around as the Protege, but a much easier car to live with - better balance between fun and comfort. But of course handling still beats the pants off an Accord or (yawn) Camry! Size was just-right for me, and comfy enough in back that I don't feel guilty putting passengers back there like I used to.",3
1086,"I recently traded in my 2005 Acura TL for a 2008 Honda Civic EX-L. I know, why would you do that? Well, I drive about 30K a year,my TL had 60K miles and it was time to either keep it till death or trade. I could have got another TL or similar car, but the premium gas and the mileage were starting to hurt. So I went hunting for something simpler and more economical. I considered a hybrid, but the numbers just don't work. The Civic is a good choice. It is peppy and fun to drive, it has everything you need. It's comfortable and very economical. I'm averaging 31+ mpg, I've had it 3 weeks and have over 1700 miles already. I added the leather, I think it brings the car to the next level.",3
1087,"I finally got my FJ and it has been all I expected and more, very civilized ride and comfort, yet ruggedly constructed, and all this for under $30k, I love it!",4
1088,"Had an '03, loved it. From the specs the '08 should be even better. It is in every way except the ride. If you're on smooth blacktop fine, any other surface you will feel via the seat each tar strip, pavement crack, bump, and if you hit a hole... oh my! I drive 55 Ca. freeway miles a day. Hate the ride every mile. Suspension way too stiff for Toyota's luxury flagship, just jar & jolt. 17"" wheels don't help either. 16"" means more absorbing rubber and a softer ride. They need to quit trying to build cars to satisfy the specification desires of some auto magazines testers whose standards are usually race track handling, the biggest wheels & lots of hpwr. The Avalon isn't a sports car!",1
1089,"This is a fun SUV (wagon). It's a real eye catcher, and you'll find yourself just looking at it or in it. It's just different. So far good on gas, better then my old Dodge 2500, at about 8 mpg. Just love this ride.",3
1090,"They hybrid engine takes a little getting used to. It's now two weeks after I started driving it, and I find I am getting over 40 mpg in mixed city and highway driving. I traded in a 2004 Camry for the Hybrid and the improvements were quite noticable. This is a comfortable, sprited well engineered vehicle. A family car that is great to drive. The gas savings put this car over the edge as far as being the right choice for the family sedan.",3
1091,"What a great car. My wife and I have been looking for a car for her for quite some time. We tested MB C Class, BMW 3s and Audi A4s. The Subaru by far out classed them on the roadways. Its handling in our opinion matched or outperformed the others. Its comfort is amazing and the power is wonderful. The 243 HP feels strong and you never need more. The car handles superbly at highway speeds and is even better in the curves. What a great car and I would recommend it to anyone. My next car will definitely be a Subaru.",4
1092,"My new CTS is awesome! I've had it for just about a month and now have 2K miles on it. It's a thrilling ride and looks gorgeous. When I bought my CTS I researched and test drove all the major competitors (BMW 3 Series, Mercedes C Class, etc.) and the CTS beat them all in drive, HP, leg room (I'm 6' 2"" and have enough room to even sit in the back) and in looks. This is my first Caddy but won't be my last.",4
1093,"I just traded in my 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee on this gem. Test drove the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Infiniti G35. This car was the best bar far. The features alone differentiate it from the others. I couldn't be happier. Perfect combination of form and function.",4
1094,"Great vehicle! We traded our 2002 Tacoma for the Yaris, and so far we have no complaints (we just had our 10,000 mile service yesterday)! The car is fun to drive, gets great gas mileage, and for the engine size and fuel economy has decent power. The car is roomier than it looks, and is a head turner wherever you go. The price is not too high considering it is a Toyota and it will last forever. Anyone in the market for a new car should test drive a Yaris.",4
1095,"this car is totally amazing... we just bought it and it is amazing, it responds so quickly when you accelerate (compared to the 06 Isuzu Ascender i traded in, which is a GMC ENVOY LOOK-A-LIKE) the armada's style is amazing... the visibility and for me a 6'4ft guy... it makes me feel small which never happens. also the chrome detail are amazing even though i got the base model, the chrome makes it look so expensive, which it was but it is worth every penny. nissan did an amazing job on it.. everyone always stares at it.. it makes me feel good. and the Bose sound system is amazing",4
1096,"Excellent car for the price. My son bought this vehicle to replace a 10 year old Saturn. I was impressed with the performance, styling, and safety features of the Cobalt. This may not be one of the ""in"" Japanese sport cars, but my son is getting a lot of comments about the car. The best part is that he can afford it.",3
1097,"This car is simply said as, ""Well Built"". I love the overall package. My vehicle is white. I placed after-market 20"" chrome rims. My ride is a definite eye catcher. Riding on rims will always make a little more noise over stock rims. But it is small sacrifice for large rewards. And best of all, it's a Toyota. ""Another one for the good guys"". Enough said.",3
1098,"We wanted this car forever. Heard they were changing the body style so we waited another year!! Glad we did. The truck handles great. The traction control really works. I was making a turn onto a wet just paved street and the truck started to spin. The traction control kicked in and set the truck straight! That is the best feature they could have added to a truck this size. The only complaint is I only get 12.5 miles to the gallon. How long does it take for the fuel management system to kick in? I only have 800 miles on it, maybe someone can let me know. Also, we have black leather and light tan looking headliner which looks weird. Other than that we love it, drives so smooth, and quiet!",3
1099,"This is a great SUV with superior handling, comfort, and overall appearance. Fuel economy is edging toward the v8 area, but considering the size of the mdx, it gets pretty good mileage. Ride is very smooth and the 300 hp gets it up and going quickly. Recommend the mdx to anyone looking into an SUV with the performance and luxury you get with Acura, and the reliability you can expect from Honda.",3
1100,"Our 3rd Audi. This one is just not up to what we had expected. Example - the gas door feels and works like a Yugo. Instrument panel is directly under cup holders and any spills screw up the audio. $800 to fix and not covered by warranty. Service has declined dramatically over the years. It feels like they are trying to wring every dime they can from us at every chance. Not much different than most but different than our past experience. Have had for 1.5 years and seems like there is always some little thing wrong. Engine is great, great on snow. If I had it to do over again I would get the GL 450 or 550. The Acura is more reliable but does not drive as well or turn as sharply.",1
1101,"I got this car in place of a Porsche 911 S and believe me, this car is no Porsche. It's huge for a ""sports car"". A sports car is supposed to be small, powerful and nimble. The Vette's handling is comparable to an elephant trying to perform on the balance beam at the Olympics. Sure, I like the power under the hood. 30 horses with the dual mode exhaust sounds great, but that's about the only thing that's great on this car. After driving BMW's, Z cars, Porsche's and even my Mercedes E350, I am very disappointed in the way this car's handing and appointments are for the money. Can't anyone in the U.S. build a ""sports car"" at least in the league of the afore mentioned. Pitiful.",0
1102,"We've owned many domestic vehicles and decided to step-up to the 'superior' quality of a Honda. What a disappointment! The first year was okay with the vehicle however it's now falling apart. Performs poorly in the cold, if it starts at all. Don't think of driving in winter weather without snow tires. The alarm is toast. The electronics are on the fritz. Seat belts don't retract. Weather stripping is worn through. Loud clunk in the trunk area when making turns. Has a severe shake when approaching highway speeds. Hard to find a comfortable driving position. Overall, the most disappointing vehicle we've ever owned! Will never buy a Honda again.",0
1103,"This is my 3rd VW, the first two being a Beetle and Super Beetle I bought back in 1969 and 1973. I've forgotten how much fun VW's are to drive. This car seems quicker than the posted times with smooth as silk shifting. Brakes are going strong after 20K miles. Awesome Ride!",4
1104,"Quality, size, fast, and fun, the list could go on. I wanted a large SUV and ended up comparing Navigator, Escalade and the GL. In my opinion, there is no contest.",4
1105,"I've owned 10 vehicles over the last 25 years and the CLS550 is unquestionably the biggest disappointment. Bottom line - I've got an $80,000+ luxury vehicle with all the bells and whistles that drives like a 1972 Fiat. Despite being in the shop 3 times in the first 90 days, the vehicle continues to violently rattle and vibrate, the ""premium sound system"" sounds like a transistor radio, and the ""climate controlled seats"" are nothing more than a weak fan with an imperceptable effect. Two thumbs down!",0
1106,"I traded my Ford F150 for this car. It hurt but the mileage on the truck was bad compared to how I used it. I used it as a car and hauled very little. I get 19 /21 in town w/the Malibu, that includes the 1000' of altitude I gain or loose on the 4 mile trip to town. The Malibu is the first car I have owned in many years. I have had no problems so far. Miss my truck but at this point would not want to get rid of the Malibu.",3
1107,"Since I picked up my car, I have been completely satisfied with the performance, quality and comfort in operation. I work in the retail sector and have people stop me to find out about the car and its operation. I receive questions from all age groups. The biggest question has been how could they get so much room in the interior without squeezing things into a small vehicle. I love my ""FIT"" and it fits me fine.",4
1108,"I have owned VWs for the past 10 years and I must say VW out did itself with the 2007 Passat. Although the interior is not as flashy as the Toyota Camry it is simply and functional and yet classy. The 2.0T engine with the automatic transmission gives you more than enough power when you need it. The electronic steering gives you stability and no steering jar even when driving over the roughest roads. It has a smooth ride and minimal wind noise. Its rear seat room is overwhelming when compared to previous year Passats and its 60/40 rear folding seats are a plus. The price ($27,300) compared to other competitors like Camry and Accord was in my opinion and value when comparing all of the features, like the sunroof and heated seats.",3
1109,"I have not test driven too many cars, but this one was perfect. It has all the features we wanted, except for the ones I listed below. Seriously - we got this car knowing that I would miss automatic on/off headlights, knowing that it would be a little nosier than my previous car. There is just no one else who can deliver better designed and more attractive small SUV! (I'll also miss a bigger storage area between front seats, but I guess it's available on the EX-L model).",4
1110,"The reviews of the Compass have been almost universally negative, and almost universally wrong. It's a great car, economical, safe, comfortable, fun, and stylish! I've had plenty of stares and at least three women tell me they really like how it looks. The acceleration is good: good from a stop and good for passing. It just feels slow because of the CVT, which takes a little getting used to, but is really nice once to adjust your driving style.",3
1111,"I have owned my Patriot 9 months and have yet to be disappointed. It's fun, gets great mileage, and is very comfortable. My son is 6'1"" and easily sits in the back seat. Plenty of cargo room in the back. We have taken it on many long trips already. It's great both on trips and around town. I went from a Cherokee to the Patriot. We plan on keeping it for many years. We recommend it to anyone.",4
1112,"Bigger, faster, smoother, and quieter than my 2004 Comprressor Sports Sedan. Appears to be improved in all areas. Classic Mercedes exterior styling, but the company should swallow half the cost & put real leather in all models to elevate itself above the BMW 3 Series entry sedan. Received a great deal with year end factory rebates & convenient home delivery!",4
1113,"I bought this car over the Camry, Accord and Sonata because it moved better than the Camry, was more comfortable than the Accord and because I believe Chevrolet is more reliable than Hyundai. I am most impressed with how quiet this car is. Tire/road noise is less than Honda. This car comes standard with many options and the GM 6 cylinder engine is a very reliable engine making this car an excellent choice for a mid sized family car.",4
1114,I enjoy driving the Rondo but you feel every bump in the road and that is uncomfortable. The gas mileage is okay but I had hoped it would be better (don't we all?),3
1115,"Great performance, acceleration, handling etc. Considering its weight and size mileage is suprisingly good. usually 18MPG+ on the highway driving at 70+ MPH. ------------------------------------ - It has been fixed now but the rear hatch would sometimes open without any input from the remote.",3
1116,My wife picked the color Kiwi Green. I traded in my F250 4x4 for this pip sweek. I haven't turned back yet. We get consistent 34 MPG and have achieved 50 MPG on backroads average speed 25 MPH. I would like to see more driver features to affect fuel economy like electric only from the line. I use mine mostly for .5 to 1 mile trips just in time to get to electric. Also a plug in option would be nice. Hats off to all those supporting this awesome technology of regenerative braking.,3
1117,"Great safety package standard, smooth, powerful ride. Nice upgrades. Limited model with power sliding doors and liftgate is great for families with kids and their hands full. Stylish design, roomy interior and great pricing.",4
1118,"First off, this is my 3rd Honda which says a lot. Customer loyalty I guess. I looked at the CR-V and it was a bit ""fancy"" for me. I want my little truck to be a truck. I am going to fill it up with all kinds of stuff ranging from Mulch to Christmas trees. The ""wipe it clean"" interior is awesome just for that. Looking at it you would think this is about as aerodynamic as a refrigerator with the door ope. The reality is, the thing is VERY well designed. Virtually no exterior noise when cruising along at 65. Gas consumption is not at all bad considering its a truckish vehicle. Over all this is a really fun SUV and worth every penny. We love it very much. And best of all, It's a Honda!!!!",4
1119,"I compared Honda, Toyota, Ford, Saturn, Pontiac and was surprised to find that the Optima beat out the others. The deciding factor was the standard safety features and room. I am 6'4"" and found that most of the others wouldn't accommodate my knees. The backseat is great and there is more than enough room all around. I have owned the car only a short while but have been very impressed with the overall common-sense design. The ride is very good. It is a midsize sedan, not a sports car. The standard 2.4 is plenty for me especially with the ability to down/up shift. I did the comparison, crunched the numbers and for the money you just cant beat it.",4
1120,"I don't usally write reviews but I felt I needed to write this one. I've owned this car a week so I've still got new car fever. I've been driving a Ford Supercrew for 7 years so going to a Prius was a new view on the world to say the least. If you are a big vehicle driver you need to check this car out... no regrets. My 2 kids have enough room in the back even with me (6'1"" 220 lbs) in the driver's seat. We all have room to spare. My wife and I find ourselves fighting over who gets the car. Our first tank of gas got 46.7 MPG and we are doing even better on our 2nd.",4
1121,I havearound 10000 kms on this truck. It works great and has lots of power and speed. I have a 97 yukon gt too and this has 400000 sobig fan of yukons. This one has alot more technolgy than the old one but both are great,3
1122,"We just purchased a 2008. The vehicle is beautiful. The power is more than adaquate. With all of the safety options and driving control/traction we can't wait to use it in the snow as we travel in the Denver/Boulder area. This car will be our last ""big purchase"" for us for a long time. It has all of the features Can't lose with a Benz, however you also can't get a true ""Benz"" without adding the options and plan on spending over $45,000 when you are all done.",3
1123,"I have leased 2 Jeep Grand Cherokees, a Dodge Durango, a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon and now a Dodge Nitro. By far, the Dodge Nitro is my absolute favorite hands down! The Dodge Nitro is such a pleasure to drive and a head turner to boot! The overall performance is so impressive for an SUV, I would recommend this vehicle to anyone. The price point on the Nitro is far less than what you would expect to pay for such quality. Thank you to Chrysler for designing such an awesome machine!",4
1124,"I have 2000 miles on my SX4 now and it just keeps getting better. I have all the bells and whistles. Like XM radio, mp3 hook up, 9 speaker sound, 6 disk CD. Also the cold-air intake, underdrive pulley and the piggyback ECU. The SX4 is very fun to drive. The switchable FWD, AWD and 4WD lock is great!",3
1125,"Unsure where to start. I just love this car. It drives great, very good acceleration and handling and I'm averaging 28 MPG combined driving! Everyone compliments on how great it looks and how the interior feels so great. Everytime I walk up to the GTI it makes me smile. If the car was totalled for some reason I be at the VW dealership the next day to buy another one.",4
1126,"I started out looking for a used mid size suv. Looked at due to 4,000 rebate which helped my upside down on trade in. Loved this car more than any I have owned. At first thought I made a mistake. Read alot of reviews on CX7 and other cross overs and know I made the correct choice.",3
1127,"This is my 2nd Silverado regular cab WT from this generation truck. Other than a rougher ride than I recall in the '04 I am fairly satisfied. The rough ride may be because GM converted to 17 inch wheels for gas mileage in '05 versus 16 inchers on the '04, or because one of the OEM General tires was noticeably out of round. Took a trip to the tire store to get it fixed, but still bumpier than I recall on the last one. So far it is averaging 17MPG in town with a lot of that being on the freeway at about 60MPH, so hopefully that will improve as the vehicle gets a bit more broken in. It was hard to beat the price of the regular cab Classic back in October when GM had $4K rebates on it.",2
1128,"I decided that maybe Audi had just created the perfect luxury car. After 3k miles I believe they have. It is perfectly silent when you want it to be. Want to be sporty? One or two down shifts and a tap of the right foot and you know you are in the right car. The electronics are well thought out too. Handling stuns. The throttle is not too sensitive. No problem (did they fix it?). Looks? Subjective, yes, but it makes a very discrete statement. I am very happy my S8. And I don't miss my 997 a bit.",4
1129,"This car has been pure pleasure. I was disappointed with the pricey option packages, but the car has been a treat. I've carried 5 people on 2-3 hour long drives in comfort. The cargo room is a little tight, but I've never been lacking. The car is fun to drive and responsive, the design is sleek and the interior is very comfortable. It's perfect to load on my kayak, bikes or snow shoes. The Rogue has been my adventure companion!",4
1130,"wife and I both luv our fusion. Economy is decent, but we both like the the pedal on the right. It works great. Ride, handling, comfort all great. Would put this against any car priced close. Prospective buyers, try this one.",4
1131,This all new Element is totally awesome. I was going to get a 2006 EX-P but I thought I'd wait for the 2007 and all its new features. Have already slept in it. And also goes on back roads wonderfully.,3
1132,"In the mid-size sedan class I was torn I have owned a Honda Accord and a Toyota Camry. After driving the Saturn Aura and experiencing to ""Saturn Sales Experience"", I knew that I was set to purchase the Aura! The five star safety rating was important to me in making my decision as was the trim level for the price. My car is equipped with leather, a sunroof, remote vehicle start and six air bags. A comparable Luxury brand would have cost me a lot more money. I have the 3.6 liter V6 which makes me feels like I'm driving a Cadillac or Corvette!",3
1133,"I previously owned a Lexus GS which was a rattle trap. I was originally concerned that the BMW would ride too rough for me since I have some pretty severe back problems. The 535 far exceeds my hopes and expectations. Not only are the comfort seats the most comfortable I've ever owned, but the ride is superb. It is a bit firmer than the Lexus, but the support the seats provide make the BMW a much more comfortable car for me. And this thing is rock solid - no rattles. Plus the fun factor is out of this world.This car is a rocket on rails. My wife always disliked the looks of BMW, but I can't get her out of this car. The iDrive is a piece of cake, nav system is great, and the prem stereo rocks.",4
1134,"Don't believe me do you? Most people don't know that Ford owns Range Rover. Many times I rode in my friend'd $80k Rover and salivated. Then I drove the Edge and oh my gosh! I felt right back in the Rover. Same wheel, stereo, ride, feel, stiffness, and power. It's even faster than a BMW X5. It is also the first Ford to appear prestigious in all manner of profiles. Nav and XM are also perfect, just lacked Bluetooth. Oh, and the entire back seat reclines so far back that Hulk Hogan could side cross his legs. Folding front seat into a table-esque platform makes it a limo, and the center console can conceal an entire laptop. Perfect, just perfect.",4
1135,"Second Dodge vehicle I've purchased. I love the new Dodge Grand Caravan! The entertainment system is unsurpassed, with the MyGig System and the rear dual overhead DVD screens. The exterior styling is more masculine than the competition. 2nd and 3rd rows both still fold underneath, a great feature. Limited lifetime warranty on the powertrain for the original owner is priceless. Was about $3,000 to $4,000 less expensive than the Odyssey and Sienna for a comparably equipped vehicle, but those two can't touch the entertainment system. My wife and I fight over who gets to drive it. Thus far, we love the Caravan!",4
1136,"I have a 4 cyl 6 speed tiptronic Turbo Passat SW and love it! It gets great gas mileage around 35 miles to a gallon, and when it shifts it's so smooth you can't feel it. American carmakers are now discovering the tiptronic but putting them with 6 cyl cars. Unless you're towing something you don't need an engine that big.",3
1137,"Have had it for 2 days and love it. Wanted it solely for mpg, so bells & whistles were not a necessity. It's just plain fun to drive. Parks like a dream (no depth perception so that's important), feels bigger than it is, good interior room, shifts great, acceleration is good, great Toyota a/c, thought dashboard design would be awkward - not, will be a great commuter car (70 miles a day). Other subcompacts have similar mpg & more base options but are more money, If you can find one, buy it, most bang for $.",3
1138,"Amazing combination of luxury and performance. I have the 40 series summer tires and the cornering is amazing. Looked at the G35/M35 (owned 2 other Infinitis) & 535. The G35/M35 turns WAY too many RPM on the highway - 3400 versus 2300 (GS) at 80. The 535 was TOO expensive, $15,000 more out the door with comparable equipment. The GS is faster than the M35 plus gets several more MPG.",4
1139,"There are many things I love about this car, its engine, 6 speed, wheels and handling. It is also comfortable and quiet on trips. It is very reliable, with no problems over the past year. In fact, it feels like a mini-Acura TL-S Type. My one complaint is the gas mileage. I can only get about 32 at highway speeds and that's if I keep it at 70 and below. Not an easy thing to do in this car because speed comes on quickly and keeps climbing. its easy to do 90 MPH. Love the interior but hate that you can only get black interior. It is very hot in a car with so much glass. It also shows lint like crazy. Radio is good too.",3
1140,"Big interior, trunk. Good handling, very quiet on hwy. Good mileage. Fit and finish above average. I am 6,4"" and weigh 260 lbs and I have ample room.",3
1141,Compared to the 2002-2006 MINI cooper S the current MINI is leaps and bounds ahead. Providing quicker 0-60mph and overtaking times. The engine is a major improvment and one can see and feel that this is actually a BMW designed vehicle.,3
1142,"Fuel economy is great. The car gets about 33-35mpg in spirited driving and can do up to 42mpg if driven economically. I would prefer a manual transmission but the automatic performs very well for a commuter car. I always use 87-octane gas, Royal Purple synthetic motor oil and a K&N reusable air filter in the stock intake. I have a sub in the trunk and heavier speakers upfront that probably cancel out the mpg gains from the oil/filter. Worth it to me. Undoubtedly the car?s aerodynamic car- forward design contributes to its fuel economy as well, but the thick pillars front and rear cause large blind spots making lane changes a bit more risky than I?d like.",3
1143,"I really like this car. I drove a similar, but smaller model in Spain and was thrilled to see that Nissan was putting out a subcompact in the USA. I was looking for a car that rode a little higher than the average sedan, but still got good gas mileage, and didn't cost too much. I got all those things in the Versa, and I haven't been disappointed in any of its quirks (e.g. audible shifting noises, loose handling, flimsy velcro attachment for the hatch cover). Plus, I love the upholstery (microfibery), the tire pressure monitoring system, the touch- sensitive hatch lifter, and the interior room with an adorable, easy to park exterior.",3
1144,I've had the car less than a month. I really like the interior room. The power of this car is satisfactory. There is plenty of room for the kids in the back. I wish it would get at least 35 mpg on the highway.,2
1145,"We bought this for my wife, after looking at numerous cars and sitting behind the wheel, she like this the best. She was happy with the styling, performance and handling. No other manufactor could come near the price and the warranty is great. I have owned Suzukis' before and I'm very happy with their reliabilty. She wanted the sunfoof model but they were sold out.",3
1146,"The first thing that impresed me was the engine - it is small but quite powerful. One just has to push the accelerator pedal down to get most out of it. The acceleration is especially impressive with the gear in the sport mode - even from a zero start. I love the exterior design. Tthe same goes for the interior, with some reservation for the front seat ergonomics - they are comfortable but could be a bit more accomodating. To add a ""fly to the ointment"" - I already had to get the sensor switch in the passenger seat safety belt buckle replaced. The dealership experience has been very good so far.",3
1147,Bad mama jama I haven't towed my 5th wheel yet but will soon. 12.5 mpg @ 65 mph with a 4.88 rear end I have 14000 miles now and when I had 7000 miles I got 10.5 mpg.,3
1148,"Love this car. Was a little scared to purchase a Kia, not now, I love it. Read that the fuel efficiency wasn't too good, have taken it on two trips now and averaged over 400 miles to one tank. I love this car so far. Would recommend to anyone.",4
1149,"This is truly an amazing vehicle for the price - outstanding performance. The 2008 Rabbit handles better than my 528i BMW - you never feel like you are losing control. Tight going into and coming out of turns. And acceleration; this car responds. I'm 6' 1"" and fit comfortably. Controls are easy to reach and intuitive - well designed interior. Yes, it is very enjoyable to drive and exceeds my expectations for a car under $20k! When driving conservatively, the car averages around 27-28 MPG - highway gets 30 MPG easy.",4
1150,"My round trip daily commute to work is 120 miles. I have found the Impala to be stylish and comfortable and affordable. Would like better fuel economy. By changing brands of gasoline, I have increased gas mileage from 21 to 24/25 mpg hwy. I have owned 2 Monte Carlos, 2001 LS and 2006 LT and miss them both. 119,000 and 88,000 respectively. The Impala LTZ and SS are as close as you will come to the soon to be extinct Monte Carlos. The OnStar feature was a selling point for me and the Impala LTZ is priced right--good buy.",3
1151,"I have always been a Honda Accord owner but with a growing family, I needed a larger sedan (able to handle a car seat and two additional kids in the backseat without touching each other). The 2007 Avalon has been great. It has a great interior for the price tag vs Lexus or BMW.",3
1152,"Traded a Cayenne and could not be happier. The 300 HP provides great power, especially when downshifted. Base model has all any true driver would need. Really, how often does anyone need to use a GPS or call a restaurant while on the road or, for that matter, not know what is behind their vehicle. This is a vehicle which can complete with the top SUVs on the market and retain its value. Third seat is not for adults. SH-AWD is truly for those who want to ""push"" the vehicle while maintaining control in all conditions. I have found the seating position for the driver to be very comfortable. Sound system with the subwoffer can blow your teenager out of the vehicle.",4
1153,"This may be the ultimate Volvo. I now have 3000 miles on it and like it even more than when I bought it. I most seriously considered the Infiniti M35 as I wanted to try something other than a Volvo (I have owned 5). However, safety concerns, gas mileage, and the way features are packaged individually led me back to the Volvo. A test drive of both cars sealed the deal. The Volvo seems to have a better feel for the road. It is smooth, yet extremely responsive both in handling and acceleration. It is the best Volvo yet and may have already sold me on Volvo the next time as well.",4
1154,"The performance of the car is great. Handling is also great for an economy car, specially compared to the previous year and competitors. This car will be excellent for autocross.",4
1155,"Buyer beware. I am very disappointed. The most troublesome problem with the car is that there is a significant, and very distracting, vibration in the steering wheel, driver?s seat, and middle console when the car is at a resting idle. This alone makes me dislike this car. The car has been in for service 3 times. American Honda Corp?s position on the problem is that it is within manufacturing standards. There is also a significant vibration in the steering wheel and roughness at highway speeds. The road noise is loud. This car does NOT get 34 mpg, 30 at best. I would not buy this car again. I would recommend you test drive multiple cars and read many customer reviews.",0
1156,"This car is absolutely fantastic. it's fit and Finish are stellar, the 4 wheel active steer is amazing and if your ordering a car, don't skip this option! The handling is stellar, the power of this car is actually dangerous for most people.. I wish it had a way to cut the power in 1/2 for valets and the wife :) If you're looking for the king of performance it's either the G35S or the BMW 335i for ($11K more) but I don't see $11K in extra value out of the 335i. The TL is not in the same performance league and the IS350 falls quite short on handling and driver feedback.",4
1157,"I bought the absolutely red hatchback. I love the car. Great gas mileage, fun to drive. Everyone asks me if it's a hybrid. Great for city driving.",4
1158,"Was hooked after my first drive. Handles very well for what it is. Getting about 18mpg by keeping my foot ""out of it"". Should get better mileage on the highway. Installed a K&N air filter and use Mobil 1 synthetic oil. The motor seems strong and is always willing to rev. It's easily handling the current No. Indiana winter. No problem, from mushy slush, to blowing thru drifted-over county roads. It tracks and runs well. Could use better visibility but you'll learn to drive with the mirrors. Ventilation could be better. Having a small issue with the paint job on the hood. I do plan on keeping this vehicle for a long time as it feels strong and has a basically good build design. I like it.",3
1159,Overall excellent vehicle. I am very happy with the way it drive and rides. So far for a brand new car gas mileage around town 25.1 mpg,4
1160,"I purchased my 2008 Nissan Altima in April 2008. It has been a great car thus far, fun to drive and handles well. I love the push button start the most, you can't be the opts for a 2.5 S. Previously, I owned a 2006 Altima but it was totaled in an accident. The new Altima improvements are noticeable and you would think they would be in a more expensive car.",3
1161,"Granted, I have owned this car for less than a week, but after a decently long trip for the holidays I feel I can give some helpful insight. For me the performance has been very acceptable. For a 1.5 liter engine it is peppy, quiet and smooth. The layout of the interior is not that quirky, but I do admit I like the sedan's interior better than the hatchback I tested - seems to be higher quality. The sound system is excellent and this is with the standard single CD AM/FM stereo. I got 40 mpg on my trip and think my opinion of this car will only get better with the miles.",3
1162,BMW is gonna learn a hard lesson in ECON 101. Every stinking day we got into our 2006 5 series another warning light was on the dash. BMW Service Good Riddance! We absolutely adore this new CTS. So far no service issues after approx 2600 miles including round trip to Colorado from Atlanta.,3
1163,"I guess I expected more from my first BMW. My wife hated the way it drove around town, so now it's mine. The transmission is definitely a design flaw and there should be a recall. On the highway it rides like a dream. It's like riding on a rail and it takes discipline to stay below 100 mph. I had a lifter noise and after several visits to service, they had to replace the cylinder head. That was another nightmare. The dealer and BMW should have made a better effort to compensate for my inconvenience.",1
1164,Great car on the highway. Very quiet. The driving around town in moderate traffic can cause frustration with the lack of response when the gas peddle is depressed while traveling at speeds in the 25-35 mph range. Sometimes depending on the gear you are in you may not get much of a response initially unless you really press hard. Sometimes it will downshift and the rpms can shoot to over 5000 when all you wanted to do was go around a slightly slower car. Can be difficult at times.,3
1165,"I just traded my Honda 2004 CRV for the Civic Ex 2007, very happy, the car is fun to drive, mileage is so much better than CRV. This is my 4th Honda vehicle. Can't beat a honda for performance. I love this car!!",4
1166,Makes clunk noise as you pull forward every time (sounds like transmission) and several times we were told that was normal. Now it is being looked at. Brakes squeeled and entire neighborhood laughed at new truck when backing up. Now has squeal in steering when turning either direction and car only has 7200 miles on it. Hate it already. Don't know what will happen next.,1
1167,"I takes a while to get used to this gem of a vehicle. The electric motor acts like a turbo to assist the gas motor. I've had a few rattles and a window motor recall, but I've been thrilled with the 36,000 miles I've put on it thus far. Handling is superb. I can spin the tires, but I wish I could get a larger electric motor as an option to help with the 1800 ft. peak I drive over twice daily on my 45 mile commute. Mileage is controversial with this car; people report all kinds. For me, if I don't watch what I'm doing, I get a combined 42 mpg (over the last 2000 miles). If I pay attention, and keep the revs below 2500, I can easily get low 50's mpg. If I draft a semi, I can get over 70!",3
1168,"The car has really good suspension, I normally drive the mountain rode everyday and handles really well. The car is a really great car for the price as well the reliability of Toyota. I thought the car would lack power but I found myself beating everyone off the line.",4
1169,"I bought a 2008 certified pre-owned Dodge Magnum SXT (silver/black) three months ago and love it. I needed space for a part-time business (photography) and did not want an SUV/crossover. This vehicle drives like a car and has more space and style then any mid-sized SUV on the road. The '08's are relatively rare as they have a redesigned front facia as well as interior (higher-end soft touch plastics, nicer center console, etc.). If you can find a CPO SXT with low miles for a reasonable price- grab it! I searched for 3 months and stole mine; it had 16K miles on it and I bought for $12,800. I plan on keeping this as a second car for years to come.",3
1170,"I got my RL (top of the line) by the end of Nov. 2007. So far it's fine. It drives well with very good highway mileage considering AWD. The average mileage rate was over 30 mi/gal in long distance driving. Before I purchased it, I searched the market well. For about $50K Mercedes/BMW/Audi were some offering their stripped versions. If you own the top of the line luxury car, your dealer treats you like a king for maintenance calls (your loaner there if need be). One thing was bad about these sports cars, they are so low. Even cement divider on parking lots touches your fender if you are not careful. Tires are so expensive (PAX system). If you damage it, prepare to pay $500 per tire change.",3
1171,I picked the 4Runner after a years research. The ride with the Xreas suspension is very good. I receive many compliments on the color (Salsa Red) and the looks of the vehicle. This is my second Toyota. I got my wife a 2004 Camry V6 Limited and she loves it.,3
1172,"I owned a 2WD Ford Pickup for eight years in Denver. So call me crazy. The 22"" snowfall in December finally got my attention. I was sick of getting stuck. I had done a little research on the SX4 and was curious about it. After I found one (most Suzuki dealers in Denver sell them as soon as they get them) I test drove and took it home. Since then we have had five snowstorms with ice and snowpack everywhere. The SX4 (Suzie is her name now) never showed any hesitation. An additional plus was with all the snow piled up everywhere, parking became an issue for everyone in the big SUVs, but not for me. What can I say? All the other reviews address comfort, ergonomics, and safety, but I am just enjoying how much fun it is",3
1173,One year plus 25000 miles totally problem free. I usually keep a car about 1 year but this is my first keeper. Still love it and still get a lot oo enjoyment driving it. Only has had routine oil changes and tire rotation and still looks and drives like the day I bought it. Looked at Totota Mazda Nisson and made the right choice.,4
1174,I had a Toyota Tundra and sold it due to its problems! I looked into Tacoma and Frontier. Frontier is far better truck than Tacoma. Nissan Frontier delivers better gas mileage and technology. I love the size and inside the cabin. Nissan should have fog lights as an option for SE model. I am looking into installing an after market fog lights. So far I have 1000 miles and I will update as time goes by!!,3
1175,"I have had my Rabbit for 2 years and have loved driving it. The problem with this car is that, when something happens to it (or even when you need an oil change), you'll be put in the poor house. Beware, the Rabbit is very high-maintenance and pricey once off-the-lot. I was lightly rear-ended, small dent: $900. I drove a dirt road leading to a mountain hiking trail and hit a bump, transmission needs to be replaced: $7000. Even an oil change: $90. I will be saving the $7000 needed to put in a new transmission and choosing a reliable, low-maintenance Japanese car, like I had before.",1
1176,"My husband wanted large and luxury. I wanted mid sized and fun. I lost out as this car has not one sporty bone. This is a road numbing boat car, remniscent of the Olds 98 my parents drove in the 70's. You can steer it at low speeds with one finger. There is none of that Ford/German stiffness/road feel like in my 01 Taurus, which I still love. But this car doesn't get much less fuel economy than say the Malibu. It has enough bells and whistles to keep me happy, with the Interior Convenience Pkg which has good stuff included. And thankfully, Sync works great and is fun; cause I'm not having much other fun driving this car. It's just too big for my tastes.",2
1177,"The BMW X3 is a perfect car for a person who likes performance, styling and great handling. Mine has the sports package and M styling and looks terrific. I had driven BMW 5 Series cars for 20 years, but needed occasional storage capacity to carry a drum set. I also have an X5 which is beautiful but it doesn't come anywhere near the X3 for performance and handling. The fit and finish is top notch with great features like the full length sunroof. I also enjoy the sitting position which is higher than a sedan but not so high that you sway with every bump like you do in most trucks and SUVs. One great car....",3
1178,What a nice car overall! The build quality is on par with my wife's MB SLK. Interior could be a little nicer as there's too much plastic. I ordered the magnetic suspension which should be on all these. The satellite nav is a must as it adds a touch of luxury to an otherwise plain-jane dashboard. GM really needs to fix this on a $65K car.,3
1179,"The styling of the car is impressive as it has the lines of a much more expensive car. The ride has been disappointing. Very bumpy and not driver friendly at highway speeds. I was willing to overlook the firm ride if highway stability was solid but that's just not the case. The transmission has a tendency to shift up at low RPM (1K-2K) leaving normal acceleration feeling tired. Although, the 6cyl is very responsive if you step on it or use the paddle shifter instead.",1
1180,"Looked at numerous vehicles for a year, hands down the best, sporty yet stable handling, carlike smooth ride, seats fit me perfectly, very comfortable leather, good thigh support, head room just enough, am 6 feet tall, bountiful leg room, actually have seat forward with plenty of leg room in rear. Went shopping and had plenty of cargo room. Dash very smart, simple and sporty, all gauges easily readable, acceleration more than ample, car feels like going slow at 65 mph, tried paddle shifters, fun but not necessary, grey with grey interior, beautiful and classy, wife so happy with car, never saw her like this with a new car, she loves the look, the feel, the comfort. Nissan has a winner here.",4
1181,"We are very happy with our new Nitro. We traded in a 2005 Mustang for it so first impressions were important. Only have around 1000 miles on it and absolely love this vehicle. Great for our Wisconsin winter. The only negative we have at this point is that gas mileage is terrible - hope this changes once the vehicle has broken in some. At this point we are averaging 12 - 13 mpg in the city and the best highway so far has been 19 mpg. (In comparison, I am averaging 16 mpg with my full size Dodge with a 5.9 engine!)",3
1182,"After having waited for this car, and paying for the upgrades, i feel like my money went down the drain. Day 1, pick up the car, leave the dealership, and there is a popping noise from the suspension, the cd player was broken. Took the car in found that the suspension needed to be fixed, the front tires had to be replaced and the cd player among other items. A month into ownership, the car starts making all kinds of rattles, and loud noises when coming to a stop. Cat was replaced and many clips and molding in the car. Transmission started popping out of third gear, that is still being worked on. All in all, Honda has done over 9K of warranty work on the car already!",1
1183,"I two a 10,000 lb trailer on a regular basis. My previous truck was a Ford with a 460 V8. The Tundra 5.7 bets it hands down in power and economy. I have never owned a p/u in my 35 years of driving that is as powerful as this one. It is amazing. I regularly get 20 mpg driving 55 mpg empty highway miles. Around town is 14 mpg and pulling a loaded trailer at 55 mpg gets me 14 mpg. I use regular gas and everything factory.",4
1184,"I drive 60 miles to work. My chevy truck gets 15 mpg. Gas prices drove me to the small car and Edmunds reviews by others made my choice for the Yaris. First fillup 38.1 mpg, next fillup 37.9 mpg next was 40.7 mpg. I drive 60 miles work 5 lights hwy driving. I am 6ft 3in plenty headroom sedan 4 door. Fun to drive, plenty trunk room automatic shifts great.",3
1185,"We looked at the xA, xB, accent, Rio, Spectra, Civic, Sentra, Corolla, and others but after testing the Fit ...no contest... the Fit is far better than the others... its combination of looks, feel, room, features, price, & mileage are unmatched... definitely need to get the Sport... more than worth the extra money... the Civic has less room, less flexibility, less features, and less looks (opinion), all for a couple thou more... only advantage is more power.",3
1186,"Fun to drive - looks great. Really look forward to driving FJ daily. I realize this is strange, but non-aerodynamic windshield does not deflect bugs, so one must be ready to clean windshield quite a bit.",3
1187,"Before buying my 2008 Sport Hardtop 5-speed, my main concerns were riding comfort and gas mileage. After experiencing my first long trip (5905 mi), both concerns are gone! Ride is firm, but comfortable, with exception of older concrete surfaces that can produce fairly harsh jitters. Driver seat is very supportive, especially the back. Overall ride is very good, not great, and very quiet for a convertible. If you're not a lead foot, you can get very good gas mileage. I've gotten 32.5 mpg in/around town, and 35.6 mpg total over the long trip above (as high as almost 42 mpg in slower mountain driving, and low of 33 mpg at sustained highway speeds of 70/75 mph. (All mileages calculated.)",3
1188,"This is the best car I have ever owned and its a Saturn! I just came out of a loaded 2006 Range Rover HSE and I would have never even thought about a Saturn Outlook XR AWD but after test driving it, I fell in love with everything about it. It is so roomy inside, the styling is very up to date and it drives with so little effort. It doesn't look big from the outside, the profile is very low but don't let that deceive you, inside is spacious with room for 7. Its a little sluggish off the line but if you downshift you make up for that. My only complaint are the doors, they tend to close on their own after opening them, tough with kids but you over look it. A must buy!",4
1189,"One year into ownership, purchased it new. I've owned 3 previous Hondas and 1 Acura so I thought it would be a no brainer. The ride is pretty rough, the steering and handling is excellent. The seats really are not bad at all, a 2 hour trip to LA and back is not difficult for a compact. My mileage is around 325 per tank. I drive it kinda hard, my last car was a VR6 GTI and I MISS THAT CAR for the overall driving experience. I have 16K on this one. Drivers side visor just broke and I hardly use it. Automatic transmission was not a good choice for this size engine, not smooth and robs power. I'm a stick guy anyway, oh well. Time to sell this and get another hatchback, there are lots of choices.",2
1190,"Only have 500 miles so far, but it's been all good. Mixed city/highway on first tank yielded over 25 mpg, and on a 90 mile highway trip today, I got 33 mpg!! Plenty of power, great ride, and the new exterior design of the '08 is sharp.",3
1191,"My chief complaint of this car is it has no locking glove compartment. For God's sake Kia's have locking glove compartments. How do you turn your vehicle over to a valet? Presumably a Mercedes would likely visit valet parking more often than most? Add to that, access to the rear seats comes from lifting and pulling forward the rear seat. Cars half its price have electric motors that do it. Its like driving an old Euro taxi. Build quality, first year, 3rd brakelight lens cover fell out when trunk closed, whining belt pulley,seatbelt not retracting correctly. Wife's '06 E series needed new tranny first 3 months of owning. Not your daddys Benz.",1
1192,"I got a lemon. My Escape was great for the first 6 months and now it seems to be in the shop every week. Back hatch mechanism failed twice, had to replace condenser motor because of a transmission leak. My temperature and door lock options on the convience package change on there own and ford has no fix yet. Fog lights are filling up with water and shorting out.",0
1193,"When I purchased this car, I loved the features. Now, almost two years later, I regret buying it. While still very pretty, for a mini van, every thing is breaking. The rear cup holders, the rear sonar, the rear cover. Every little piece of plastic that can break is breaking. I could understand if I was hard on the vehicle. But it is mostly city driving, which the mileage is horrible, 11-13 miles per gallon.",1
1194,"I love everything about my Civic, the styling, the fuel economy, the handling, the performance, and it is very quiet and comfortable for its size. Best of all is its quality, though. From the fit and finish to the feel of it's switches, this car oozes quality. Having driven Japanese cars for 20 years, I think I'm hard to impress, too. This is my first Honda, but it won't be my last.",4
1195,"I bought the Tiburon new. I started having trouble with the tires right away. Had to air them up within first month, and every 6-8 weeks after that. Took it back to the dealer four times. They said no apparent leak, maybe a problem with the seal. So added nitrogen. 8 weeks later, a tire low again. Deal will not replace tire. Hyundai customer service says Hyundai is not responsible for defective tires, the tire manufacturer is. I purchased road hazard and extended warranty. Neither will cover defective tires. I don't feel safe driving the car.",1
1196,"The minute I drove off the lot I new this car was better engineered than any previous car I've purchased. I do not purchase a car to impress others but this car has certainly impressed me. Handling and power makes driving fun. Interior design of dash and controls very handsome without being over done. Extremely pleased and have been surprised by the mileage (25 mpg) for an AWD car. Haven't taken any long distance drives as yet, I'm sure it will be even better yet.",3
1197,"I love my 2008 Nissan Rogue. It is my first ""grown up"" car, and I have thoroughly enjoyed having it. My husband and I are both over 6' tall, and we both fit comfortably in the front seats. The interior and exterior are very well-designed (this opinion is coming from a professional product designer). Nissan really did a great job of including a number of convenient features in the Rogue (i.e., a deep glove compartment, nice cup holders, an auxiliary plug, pen holders, insurance card holders, etc.). The Rogue comes with great safety features such as side curtain air bags and a tire air pressure monitor. These are great features that come standard on the base model Rogue S.",3
1198,"Been driving fast cars since 1968, and figured this would be the last chance to get a real Shelby. It is an absolute blast! If I hear a complaint about this car I just figure it's either somebody who's never driven one, or somebody who can't (or won't) get one. Very smooth to drive (I only burnt rubber by accident once) but nearly violent at hard acceleration. I used to drive the old Mustangs, and I like that they didn't make the insides all cushy. As is, it's as cozy as you're going to get for a car that goes like this one. Exceeded my expectations in every way.",4
1199,"It's only a few hundred pounds lighter than the 3-series, but it feels a lot more light and nimble when you drive it. Both manual/auto transmissions are great: the shifting action of the manual is precise and confident; the clutch is predictable and easy to engage. There isn't much sacrifice at all in ride comfort because of its relatively tight dimension and suspension tuning. It truly is a great fun little car to toss around. It's certainly not as edgy or raw as the M3 (E46 or E92), but feels as quick and manuvable if not more (especially when compared to the new portlier E92 M3), and it has better gas mileage.",3
1200,This is my second Hemi (1st was Dodge RAM truck which I also loved) and my 1st SUV. The Aspen is a total headturner. I constantly get asked about it. Love the ride and the J package rocks with the black metallic paint and leather interior. My husband can't stop raving about how comfortable the vehicle is and he does a lot of driving. Although he has to ask permission to drive my Aspen! Ordered all the options except DVD entertainment pkg. LED interior lights are great also.,4
1201,"2nd Review, Now have 49000 miles on truck. For the first year only in the shop 13 times. 2 Radiators, Turbo controller, P/S idler pulley, A/C repair, Still smimmys when starting from stop. Trans now and again down shifts hard like I got rear ended. Dealer says no problem found. Goes into regen 3 to 5 times a day, sucks fuel while in regen. Dealer says, That is normal. Before computer up date, maybe regens 3 times a week. The truck has power, I am afraid to take off road. Will the radiator leak? Will I start a desert fire from the regen? Will I have to walk 60 miles because the truck broke down? My 2000 Ford f250 4X4 7.3L,(bought new), 268,000 miles in the shop 4 times.",1
1202,"I have had them all. Audi, BMW 535, Infinity, Lincoln, MB E350. I couldn't believe the RL when I drove it somewhat reluctantly. Incredible road hugging and plenty of power with 300 hp for a v6. You can punish this car and it keeps coming back for more. I almost went for the Lexus GS 350 but felt it was rough riding and a little noisy compared to the RL. The GS 460 would have been more fun but much more expensive. Great technology and maybe the best GPS and Bose stereo with noise abatement. Cabin is whisper quiet. I got 26 mpg on 160 mile highway trip. Not bad. Fit and finish among the best. I will enjoy this car for 36 month lease, I know.",3
1203,"2 1/2 weeks old, 650 miles, and loving every one of them. This is my second Subaru. I have a 2004 Legacy Limited Edition and I had to get another. I love my Impreza. Getting about 28 highway and about 24 city mpg. I could not ask for more. Super fun to drive. 170 hp and feels like more. To this day both of my Subarus handled and held the road like no other car I have ever driven! Can't wait for the first New Jersey snowstorm! Dark Grey Metallic paint is beautiful and everyone says so. Wish it had fog lights, they will be coming soon! Great car for a great value",3
1204,"I was very impressed with the Nissan Sentra. I was looking for an economical compact sedan that is reliable and safe. I was very pleasantly surprised about how much interior space and passenger room the Sentra has and how smooth, refined and responsive the CVT and engine were, particularly its power and acceleration for a car of this class even when carrying 4 full-sized adults and a trunk full of stuff. The Sentra has the most incentives at this time compared to the competition, and you can get bluetooth and keyless remote entry for not much more. I saved at least $2,000 by choosing this car over the Honda Civic LX. Great value, very versatile and fuel efficient daily commuter vehicle.",3
1205,My wife and I just recently purchased a 2008 Kia Rio and traded in her 01 Ford Escape. She is very happy with the car. It cost her about half to fill the gas tank than it did before and she can drive for almost twice as long. The interior is very sporty with black and red stitched seating. My question is Why would anyone want to buy a base model Rio when the price of a almost fully loaded one isn't much more.,3
1206,"Some people don't like this car because it's a V6 and front wheel drive, but it doesn't matter what they think when I'm passing Mustangs with their V8s. This car doesn't only look fast, it can back it up. If you don't regularly drive more than 1 person you should be fine, otherwise it might be an issue with the back legroom being absent. But the interior is great, displays all blue at night, has sunroof, 6 disc rockford phosgate system, displays the temp, cd track and time. I'm very pleased with this car.",3
1207,"My initial opinion of the car was that it looked so small. Once I opened the door and got inside, however, I was shocked! The interior is not only spacious but incredibly well laid out. I'm six feet tall and fit easily into the seats with ample head room to spare. The controls were especially well designed and the overall feel of the dash was that it was designed with purpose and care. Comparable models and brands often just throw a slab of plastic on and a few radio knobs and call it a dash but Scion thoughtfully put together a great interior for its owners.",3
1208,"I have always wanted a Corvette, as most men. I finally made the big decision last year, with no regrets. This is an awsome machine. Driving the vehicle is totally off the chain, I want to drive it all the time. The only improvement that I would recommend is the console between the seats. This area can be improved, my wife has some great ideas on this.",3
1209,"I've been thinking about a FX-35 for 5 years. I always thought that the mileage would be too poor for me to consider. Love a sporty driver that is practical - which defines an FX. Wanted something bigger than my 07 VW-GTI. Drove the BMW X6- nice but small, heavy, overpriced and lacks the fun to drive factor Love the FXs comfort, size, quality, sporty drive, high end finishes, feel of the wheel and those seats. Big side mirrors enhance side visibility - with backup camera, I can park easily. Haven't been this thrilled with a car since I bought my 92 Legend couple new. If you don't put your foot into it, you can do OK with gas consumption",3
1210,"Just turned 49,900 miles on my 2007 Freestyle Limited AWD. This is the best 7 passenger vehicle AWD out there. It has been through mud, sand and snow and is unstoppable. Consistently gets 20-22 mpg in combined driving in New Jersey. Back and forth Florida to New Jersey a couple of times, and the vehicle is very easy to handle. Much better in crosswinds than any SUV and just as comfortable inside. The AWD drive system from Volvo in this thing is the best, and at a much lower price than a Volvo.",4
1211,"Replaced my 2006 Outback sport with the larger version. Nice upgrade and significant price increase. I liked the AWD and style of the 08. Car handles great. Constant problem since I have owned the car is the transmission. It has been fixed twice, the third time the shop could not ""duplicate it"" Going in again tomorrow. The transmission shifts hard and clunks, feels like it is slipping. It was really bad the first 2 times. Now it does it under 40 MPH in city traffic. It's driving me nuts, litterally!",2
1212,"I got a really good deal on my Sentra, that's the good news. The rest is mostly negative. The driving position is very uncomfortable for me. I am an average size woman 5'6"" and I find the seats too small. If it was a purchase from any place other than a car dealership, I would have returned it for refund in the first week. But I'm stuck with it for years. It has been in the shop 5 times. The clutch makes a noise when depressed and again when released. The side windows rattle in their seals. After 2,500 miles, the Service Engine Soon light came on and the cruise control stopped working. I definitely should have spent more time test-driving this car and exploring other options!",1
1213,"Bought in June, 07, and aside from thinking I'm cursed for buying a new car (I've already been dinged, rear- ended, gently fortunately, and scratched by an eager canine at the dog park), I'm happy to have my first Honda after years of Volvos (finally got tired of the repairs and new ones are budget busters for me). Tried the RAV but like many people, the swing back hatch doesn't work. It's my first Honda and so far so good; decent gas mileage, comfortable for the dogs (and me), and excited about the low maintenance and high resale.",3
1214,"I have owned a Lexus GS350 for almost a year now. Overall it is very high quality, and fun to drive. The car does have some drawbacks however. As some others have reported I had problems with an annoying rattle in the dash when it is cold outside, and two trips to the dealer seem to have solved the problem. The other surprise was when I bought the car I discovered soon that it would not sync with my treo 650. Now had to trade my phone for a Motorola Q which works but is a poor substitute as a phone. I thought bluetooth was bluetooth, but would suggest a prospective buyer check the website for compatible phones before the purchase.",3
1215,"This is my first GM product. I am a self-described Mustang nut. My last vehicle was a 2004 SVT Cobra vert Mystichrome package. I have been critical of Vettes since the late 1970s. My last Cobra impressed on me, again, how uninspired contemporary Vettes were. Then the Z06 came out. After test driving a used 2006 model, I was smitten! We bought our Z06 on June 30, 2007. I am convinced and converted from Ford ""faithfulness."" This is the performance car for under $100,000.00!",4
1216,"I really enjoy my Yaris, I get great gas milage and It is a great car for anyone that doesn't want to pay that much for great quality",3
1217,"We absolutely love our Honda Fit. We haven't experienced any problems. It is very comfortable to drive and gets great gas mileage. I would definitely recommend this vehicle to anyone who asks. It is a fun, safe, reliable vehicle with a lot of cargo space.",4
1218,"After the purchase of my vehicle I begin to love it more than when I purchased it. The vehicle has looks, power, handles great and it is fun to drive. If Chevy continues to build this vehicle and make in a way that it is fun to drive we will add a second one to our household. And now the with the economy as it is and my vehicle is averaging about 31mpg on the highway and it did not cost a small fortune to own it, I am back home with American cars again. Go Chevy!",4
1219,"I like the gas mileage, ride,and handling but at 1100 miles I noticed that when I filled the gas tank the gas guage only went to 3 quarters full! Now at 2100 miles I have a check engine light and the code states that the fuel level sensor in the gas tank is no longer working! It's a disappointment to already be having problems at such a low mileage and I wonder if this is the start of things to come!",1
1220,"The QX-56 is the best SUV secret out there. Stunning fit and finish inside, and excellent engine -- torque and power (mileage is poor though). We get 13 mpg in city driving and 16 mpg highway. If you drive 55, you'd be able to coax 17.5 or 18 mpg highway. Beautiful leather and wood accents. Electronics are abundant and XM Radio is terrific. Not a ""beautiful"" car on the outside, but still the best I've owned.",4
1221,Rented a Golf MKV in Budapest to drive down to Vienna and enjoyed the car so much that we bought one soon after we got back to NJ. The car has not been in the shop once since we've owned it since I do my own service work. The car is great on long trips and handles like a car twice it's price. Bought the Rabbit over the GTI since it doesn't need premium fuel like the turbo charged 2.0 motors. The interior space is excellent and really like the positioning of controls. The overall fit and finish is excellent and typical of a good European car. Overall we'll be keeping this car for a while since I usually get tired of cars pretty quickly,4
1222,"The acceleration is exhilerating, especially when the 2 valves in the exhaust opens. It is like afterburners in a jet. The tight handling is unbelieveable. It sticks to the road like glue and comes out of curves smooth as silk. When driving this car all worries of the day seem to disappear.",4
1223,"Have owned a 2007 Rondo since Labor Day 2007. Never considered a Kia. We looked at the Vue, Mazda 5, HHR, and Dodge Caravan before stumbling on the Rondo. Surprising to see so few on the road! Nice comfortable vehicle to drive. Lots of storage areas in car, and easy to configure car to store larger items. Our goal was a fuel efficient vehicle with lots of safety equipment, and this care fits that bill. Excellent vision out of the front windshield (minivan-like). Definitely recommend this car for families on a budget, but whom don't want to sacrifice safety of you & your kids!! Give this vehicle a try - glad we did.",4
1224,"I purchased the 2008 Jetta S a month ago. So far it has been a great car. I like the fact that the basic model looks practically the same inside and out. I opted for the ""Titanium"" package, which included the 17"" wheels and rear spoiler, and it was definitely worth the price because the wheels really make the car. You would never know that it is a base model when seeing it drive by.",3
1225,"Just bought the rogue last week and I love it. Compared it with CR-V, RAV4 and CX-7, and am happy with the ride, comfort, handling, and engine (for a 4 banger). The CVT takes some getting used to, coming from someone who as a teenager had a firebird formula 400; but works well enough and getting 28 mpg on highway w/out the engine broken in. Bose stereo sounds boss, bluetooth through the stereo with steering wheel buttons is great! My wife loves the styling and the kids (actually 21 & 17) find the rear seat very comfortable, with plenty of room behind them for their junk!",3
1226,I think this is a very under-rated SUV. It is so much nicer than the Envoy which is more popular. Very quiet and the fuel economy is about like everything else.,3
1227,"My sportage was a leftover 2008 and i bought it feb 2009 i was very happy with the warranty and the rebate of 4000 .i will never go back to gm after owning a kia.it handles good on the road ,and in the snow and ice.only complaint i have is that the front seats need to have arm rest.",3
1228,"Only 4K miles and now looking at a possible third transmission. Have been without the car for more than 5 weeks. An annoying rattle turned into a much larger problem: I would depress the clutch, the shifter would then pop out of gear into neutral without even touching it. Then, while driving and in gear, the shifter would simply pop out and into neutral. No clutch action necessary. Now on the second transmission. Very loud all around gearbox; difficult to shift--esp into third. Last night, went to start it: depressed clutch and stepped once on gas pedal and released: next thing I know, engine totally revs like I am still stepping on the gas! SCARY! I just want a replacement--auto trans now!",1
1229,"I bought a black '07 e350, and it's wonderful. It has the sport package and only 21,055 miles on it! It was a lease, but i gotta say, that I will from now on, most likely buy Mercedes. The only ""problem"" that we've experienced, was the transmission ECU got a glitch, because i was shifting with Touch Shift while in comfort mode for an extended period of time, and i freaked out the tranny, so it went into limp home mode. i put the car in park, turned it off, and started it up again, and it reset itself, and everything has been fine since then. It is a wonderful car, and anyone looking to buy, should get one!",4
1230,"Have a 1998 GS 400. Have owned/leased at least 5 others since 1993. This one does not live up to the hype. Extremely annoying feeling of gas- electric-gas kickin/out etc. at speeds around 59 mph. Miniscule trunk. I am currently attempting to get out from under this ""Edsel"". PS: the mileage is really only a 4-5 mpg better than my GS 400.",1
1231,"I have owned 5 Honda Accords over the last 15 years. I was about ready to buy another when I test drove the Altima. Immediately I could feel the difference. The Hondas are very smooth, reliaable and actually boring. I found the Altima fun to drive. I like the car more every day even though I've only had it for a month. The leather seats seem more comfortable than the Accord and I like the home link. Hats off to Nissan for finally making a car that I feel is comparable and even better than my reliable, plain Hondas.",4
1232,"Purchased this car for business use, and will drive 45,000 miles in 2008. Excellent seat and ride comfort for extended highway use. Great value for less than $25,000. Leather, heated, power seats; strong V-6; remote start; tire pressure monitoring at all four corners; XM radio; five-star crash rating. Better seats and ride than my previous Honda Odyssey. Likely 27-29 mpg as along-term average.",3
1233,"We had 3 Toyotas sitting at our house (Highlander Hybrid, 4Runner, and Camry), so it's no shock they were at the top of our list when it was time to get our daughter a car. We absolutely love the car all around and would definitely recommend it to everybody! MPG are excellent as we are getting 26 on average. Looked into the Escape as well and for a couple thousand more, you get better quality, mileage, and of course, legend reliability. Plenty of room for everyone, got it with the third row for convenience. Tight, but still fine. If you are looking at any comps, just go to the Toyota dealer and buy this car. You will never wish to look back! Now, we PROUDLY display 4 Toyotas at our home!",4
1234,"I have had this FWD Highlander for less than a month. I have about 2300 miles. Traveled a lot over Christmas and several trips from Fairfax, Virginia to Duck, NC and Virginia Beach. Surprised that the in town gas mileage is better than the EPA rating. Even on the first tank in town when the HL had less than 50 miles on it, the mileage under bad circumstances was over 19. Commuting to metro and in heavy traffic, I've done about 22 average on a tank of gas in town On the highway, I have been for times as high as 27.6 MPG, but my best tank average was about 26 with 25 being more common so far. Still, that is better than the EPA rating, and I'm traveling with I-95 and I-64 traffic at 75+",3
1235,"If you get a CLK550 Cabriolet, the sport suspension option is a must have. Had mine trucked down to N. Cal. from Wash. State, since it was only one in Western USA with sport suspension (for me), run flats (for wife), backseat side airbags (for son), and P3 option (best front seats). It has every opt. except power trunk closer. This is the best Mercedes I've every owned, and been loyal customer since bought 380 SL in 1982! Solid build, no problems, performs better than last year's AMG model for $20K less, quiet with the top up. 0-60 mph on mine is much faster than 5.1 sec. spec. It can go 65+ on 25mph curved exit w/o ESC. Wish I could take it to Germany and drive it on the Autobahn!",4
1236,I needed something that would take me 40 miles to school and back 3 times out of the week. I fill up once a week. Gas is amazing! The driving never gets old or tire some. I love all four cup holders I can put stuff everywhere. I has a bigger trunk space than you would think. Its also very roomy on the inside... let's just say my 90 pound lab can fit in it I'm sure anyone can. The car speeds up quickly when shifting. Zoom zoom this is the perfect car ever made,4
1237,I LOVE this car. No regrets on my purchase. Car feels and looks much more expensive then it is. Gotten into some sticky driving situations and it handled awesome. Can hardly wait for the snow.,4
1238,"This is an amazing car that I almost passed up just because it's a Ford! All model years came up in ""Most Reliable Car"" lists during my research on other cars, so I took it for a test drive and love how smoothly it handles-like a Subaru with the appearance of a Lexus and the inside comfort of a much more expensive car (large,comfy seats). It feels sturdy and safe, and is very quiet. I'd never heard of Sync but love it-- I tell my car to ""Call Home"" and it does. I would definitely consider another Fusion. Best car in its class w/more features at a cheaper price than a Toyota. A lot of car for the money! I never thought I could afford something so nice brand new.",4
1239,"Just imported a Legacy. I just want to say I love it. The handling is great. Quiet, comfortable, power is just what I need. Interior is nicely laid out. Love the climate control and heated seat.",3
1240,"I purchased the Rogue with all the bells and whistles. It has a smooth quiet ride in the city. It could be a little more quiet on the highways, due to noise leaks in the aft. If your looking for a stylish compact SUV this is a good option. You get all, if not most of the features you find on similar vehicles. However, the price is thousands less.",3
1241,"I had promised myself that I wouldn't buy another American made car (truck). Capital Ford in Raleigh, NC ran an ad at a price I couldn't pass up. After a rocky start on the price negotiations my salesman, (Martin Clark) went above and beyond the call duty, he got the owner of the company involved! The owner showed me the truck and the features and assigned his personal assistant to deal with me if I had any problems. (I was told that never happens). I bought the truck with no test drives and have had no complaints. The folks at Capital Ford are as nice as they can be. From what I can tell, they lost money on the deal, even then they are as nice as they can be.",3
1242,"We bought a 2008 HH AWD (iced amethyst mica) fully loaded except for navi. We are very happy with it! Fun to drive, good performance and comfort. We love this car.Our average mpg is about 24-27 mpg, I think it will improve this summer. Our worst mpg was 22 mpg, best was 28 mpg.",3
1243,"I stumbled on the Fit completely by accident walking through the dealership looking to buy a Civic, and walked out driving it. The fold flat seats were an immediate seller for me as no trunk can hold the things the Fit can. I think I probably paid a little too much at $15,900 for the MT but I was in a time crunch. My Fit came with sweet tinted windows that I would strongly suggest to anyone, it makes the car look very unique and sporty not to mention keeping your seats from bleaching and reducing theft. I have tracked my MPG for the first 4000 miles and I?m getting 26/36. The M/T is definitely the way to go, must quicker than my A/T 127 hp ?03 Civic. I would recommend this car to anyone!",4
1244,"After 1yr, still very happy with the purchase. Easily better than the STi which is more expensive. Did great through the winter. Always gets looks and continues to be fun to drive.",3
1245,My wife and I really enjoy our Yaris S 5-speed. The lowest mileage we've gotten is 44 and the highest almost 49. Have driven it nearly 7000 troublefree miles and are impressed with the ride and quietness for such a small relatively inexpensive car. There is plenty of passenger room and the trunk is amazingly large.,3
1246,"This car has been problem free for the last 22 months I have owned it. For the price I think there is no better riding small to mid-sized SUV on the market. I?ve had gas mileage up to 26 on a mixed driving. Quiet and smooth ride. The AWD works well on snow and ice. It is well worth the 28k I paid. Only complaint is no overhead grab bars. For those who think GM can?t make a car, please go out and drive one.",3
1247,"This car rides quietly and has some pick-up, however, I feel it gets below average gas mileage that is one of my biggest complaints. I can go about 320 miles before I have to refill the tank. I drive a lot of highway miles and they advertise that the car gets 28 or 29 mpg highway, however, that is not the case. The air conditioning works pretty well and I like the ipod adapter in the car. I have a sunroof on my car but noticed that when it's open and I drive there is a considerable amount of air noise, it's kind of annoying. I love the amount of trunk space in the car - very roomy! Also it can comfortably fit 4 adults in the car. I believe there is even 3 seat belts in the back.",3
1248,"I loved this vehicle when I first picked it up. Great ride, nimble handling, good in snow, great looks. Everything about it appealed to me. GM did a lousy job on design and testing the options. The remote start doesn't work from more than twenty feet away. The outdoor thermometer can be off by more than five degrees and you have to put the vehicle in ""Park"" to display more than five locations on the navigation system when looking for a gas station or resturant. They tell me engineering is working on the thermometer and remote start and the Nav sytem problem is a safety feature. How safe is it to pull over to the side of the Interstate to find a gas station?",2
1249,"Great vehicle. Always thought CR-V was a good vehicle, but felt the styling on the old ones were a little bit to unrefined for someone my age (mid 40's). Good power for a 4 cylinder. Fuel efficiency has not been as good as claimed (i average 25 mpg and I do about 50/50 highway/city driving). No other vehicle in this class is as practical and as good a value. Similarly equipped RAV4 would have cost me 26,000 as opposed to 23,000. Sure the Rav4 offers V6 and 3rd row seating, but why would anyone look for those things in a small SUV??? and a Rav4 equipped with those things exceeds 30,000(you can get a larger midsize SUV for that price, such as the Honda Pilot)",4
1250,"Not exactly the low-cost of ownership vehicle advertised. I just had to replace brake pads @ 9,900 miles to the tune of $270 out of pocket. I've owned many new cars in my lifetime and never replaced pads under 10k miles. This was a disappointing experience, so I have written a letter to American Honda. There are other similar complaint visible on the web. Honda needs to make improvements to the brake pad materials. Other than this, the car is comfortable, fun to drive and fuel efficient.",1
1251,I traded in an 02 Nissan Altima for the Maxima. I absolutely love it! It's very stylish and fun to drive.,3
1252,"I have had 40 cars in the past 25 years, but this is one of the best! The new GL Class is my 7th MB and the best one to date. Power is smooth and responsive, steering is fluid, sight lines are not restricted. My two complaints are the braking, which is touchy and not fluid, and the seats. The seats could use a deeper bottom cushion for your legs, a la the '07 S Class. I do have the multi contour option which helps, but doesn't solve the problem. Gas mileage is good, reaching about 18-19 on the highway. Interior space is roomy and silent! Air suspension eats up the bumps, too! Barring some lower back pain on long trips, this is the truck for you if you want to haul, be it kids, or cargo",4
1253,"I purchased tc in may 2007. It is the release series 3.0 #737 of 2500 produced.$21,000.00 price tag. All options, except for the standard 5- speed manual trans. Added trd lowering springs, short throw shifter, anti-sway bars, strut brace, exhaust for additional $2000.00. Now my $23,000.00 investment feels like 30 grand. If there is something you don't like, just adjust to your application.",3
1254,"Overall, it's a great car. Already over 1000 miles on it. Works like a champ and drives great. Be sure to buy it without PAX/Runflats. We waited for '08 so we could get normal all season radials. Went through Costco buying program, cost $37,500 (500 over invoice)",3
1255,"This vehicle is built strictly for off-road application. Don't buy it for the city use or for home-office commute. To park this car in the city is impossible task and this is not because of physical dimensions. It has too many blind spots, you always concern you might hit somebody. The backseat is not adjustable and people on the back have very little space. Besides the backseat passengers might got trapped in case of accident with no way out. You will not be able to open door if the people in the front got disable.",2
1256,"I originally did not want to spend $46,000 for a car, but the upgrade from the 328 to the 335 is definitly worth it. It is ten times faster, much more agile, and grip to the road is amazing. The Sport Package is also worth the money.",3
1257,"Have had it for a month and turns heads where ever I go. Great handling, great color (Rescue Green), quiet ride, top removal is easy. Fold down seats are awesome to be able travel with larger objects. Great for families now too. Only way could get one was if was family capable for car seat and stroller space. Qualifies as practical and fun. Can't wait for spring.",3
1258,"I looked for a very long time to get this car. I bought it with the Rockford stereo, which was a must, and complete with all the options. I was reluctant at first to buy any car with a 4 cylinder, but was very satisfied after driving mine. It did not take long to figure out that it has an amazing ride, as well as, all the power and handling anyone could ask for. This will not be my last Mitsubishi I promise you that.",3
1259,"This is not a bad car at all setting aside from numerous dealership visits within the 25k miles I have clocked with this vehicle. The engine is very smooth, quiet yet not as powerful as I would like, even with the manual transmission. The down points for this car is various suspension noises & horrible manual transmission/factory flywheel combo. At about 5000 miles, the manual transmission had to be replaced. Right after, various TSB's were performed for interior noises & passenger side front A-Pillar head air bag cover was replaced. Now I hear clanking in the suspension area when going over any type of bump or road imperfection. Also, interior plastic clips are getting loose which make noise.",1
1260,"This is my 3rd JGC, having traded in a 2005 JGC Laredo. Getting into an 08 JGC Overland with the 5.8L Hemi was awesome. The power and acceleration is amazing for an SUV. Gas Mileage so far is about 15 MPG in the city, not too bad for a big engine. Ext. looks are good, and the interior is sharp and refined. Lots of extras with the Nav, Sat. radio, Bluetooth, Back-up camera, etc. I chose this JGC over the Acura MDX because of what you get for the price. Dealer incentives made the JGC more affordable than the MDX. Plus I got the same or more bells and whistles and a vehicle that will leave the MDX,CX9, and RX in my dust. Great Truck!!",3
1261,"After owning sports cars for 26 years, Toyota Turbo Supra, Dodge Stealth R/S, I finally bought a practical vehicle (of course I kept the Stealth as well!). To my surprise the performance of my 2008 Xterra has been great, I've only lost about 1.5 seconds 0 to 60 (6.9 on timed track), handling is great and the fit and finish is wonderful. The 6 speed keeps it as a ""driver's"" SUV. My kids finally can fit comfortably and my over all mileage has been 22 MPG. It's a tough, beautiful performance SUV, I may just keep it forever.",4
1262,"Great car and value.Engine is a 1.8 liter 4 cylinder,5 spd at.Model is a 2008 EX has sunroof,driving lights all the extras except gps.Engine performance equal to most v-6 motors.Emergency brake lever not in a good location touches knee,Honda needs to relocate next time around.I get approx.36 mpg mostly highway miles,driving 60 mile round trips to and from work. I expect this to improve slightly over time.No mechanical problems and don't expect any.I would recommend the Civic to all without hesitation.",3
1263,"Purchased to replace a Land Rover on my 100 mile daily commute.I haven't had a car this small since I learned to drive way back in the day. She's not sexy, but that's the only discouraging word. I average 33 mpg consistently & change the oil every 5K with synthetic. This car's exceeded all my expectations. I was simply looking for a fuel saver aka $$ saver & I got a lot more!! Best value on the market for this type of vehicle IMHO.",4
1264,"I did a lot of research to see what new car I wanted to buy. I decided on the Impala. Had a 72 and loved it. After taking my time and looking around I finally bought the 08 Impala. But, am having touble with the brakes. Had them redone and the day after they were as bad if not worse then before I had them worked on. Pulsate when stopping and jerks me back and forth until stopped. The front axle seal had to be fixed was leaking. Had an emission sensor go out and fixed. OnStar is not working properly the dealership is reviewing the recall papers to see what needs to be fixed. Seats are very uncomfortable. Very disappointed. I did the research and got stuck. Oh, the glove box broke.",0
1265,"I love this car and I can personally vouch for the safety ratings. A month after I bought this car, I was in a head on collision. My daughter and husband were in the car and we walked away without a scratch. This car handles well, has lots of storage space and I get 33 mpg (combo of city and hwy). Not to mention, it looks better than the Corolla, Sentra, and Mazda 3. Honda's last forever and for the price, you can't find a better deal. Not to mention, the resale is better than any other.",4
1266,"I was going to buy a Ford Escape or a Ford Edge, but my son said to try the new Taurus. I bought the Taurus SEL FWD, which is almost 200 lbs lighter than the Limited AWD. The Taurus 3.5L V6 engine with its 263 HP is as fast as my old 2004 Marauder with its V8 and 302 HP, but with 18/28 MPG! Its also just like a baby Lincoln. Probably the best sedan for the money around, considering its roominess, performance, handling, ride quality, quietness, and its build quality. I suffer from partial paralysis in my legs, so I need a car that I can get in&out of more easilty. The new Ford Command Seating allows me easy ingress/egress. I feel like a normal person again when I drive our new Taurus SEL!",4
1267,"I traded in a 2004 F-150 and got 2008 Limited Sort Trac, V8, 4X4, limited chrome and electronics. Ford couldn't have done a better job of putting a vehicle together. Great power anywhere you need it, I am am happy with my mileage compared to my F-150 V8 5.4. Getting 22mph on highway. Very smooth ride, If you're looking for something like this no other manufacturer can even come close to the quality and comfort of the Sport Trac.",4
1268,"I purchased the SLT 4x2, Black, oh what an eye catcher! The first week I took it to work I was in the parking lot during lunch every day, because my co- workers wanted to see it in and out. I even get people asking me to take them for a test ride in my SUV! It handles beautifully and my husband was so impressed on the handling of my Nitro he bought his two weeks later. I get between 22 and 27 miles per gallon (highway miles) city 19 miles per gallon). I have 4 grandchildren and I can ride all of them with comfort (no fighting). They love it! I am so glad I held out on purchasing a vehicle before the Nitro.",4
1269,"I bought the truck to pull our camper but I have not had the chance to do so. This will really tell me what I like and don't like. So far I have been very pleased with the truck. It is smooth and quiet. The sales person, Angie, was non pushy helping us pick out a vehicle that we would be happy with. We have been to the service department before with another Chevy we own and have been very pleased with their work. We will buy, if it's a Chevy, from this dealer again.",3
1270,I have had my lancer for 2 years now and I work at a GM dealership believe it or not. I love my lancer. I was surprised to see all the problems that people were having with paint chipping and noise in the cabin as I have not experienced any of these. I have the GTS with AWD and it handles absolutely beautiful on the snow here in upstate New York. I'm going to keep this car till it hits 200-300k. In the meantime I am buying a 2010 Camaro for a toy.,3
1271,"I bought my '07 Maxima new. Now have 50k miles on it in 2.5 years. Until 3 weeks ago only put oil in it and normal preventative maintenance like rotate tires and check fluids. Recently took it to the purchasing dealership service dept. and they say the CVT transmission is going bad. Luckily it is under warranty. (60k miles) I first noticed a light tapping noise at slow speed coming from the front end. Now three weeks later I am waiting on a new transmission to come in as they do not have re-manufactured ones because they are too new. Still runs, but the tapping noise is irritating. Did not pay the $$ I did to have it go bad. When working fine, the CVT is GREAT. Otherwise, I love the car.",3
1272,"I've had my Yaris for a little over a year and a half. Amazing gas mileage one of the things I love, it's got quite a lot of oomph when you want it. I think it's probably best as a tuner car. I don't recommend it as a family sedan though, unless you have snow tires on it, it slides everywhere in the winter, the car's too light for decent winter driving. Also I'm expecting and am very afraid to put my child in the car, I've seen them get totaled at 15 mph. As much as I do love this little car, I hate it at the same time, wish it was safer. As it stands with a little one on the way I'm searching for something else. It'll make me sad to see it go, but I gotta do what's best for my family.",2
1273,We sold out Mitsubishi Evolution in an effort to decrease our car payment and decrease our gas consumption. The civic seemed like the obvious winner in our minds. We wanted a bigger vehicle (Accord or Acura TL) but their real world gas mileage isn't that great. We settled with the smaller civic and are very happy. The leather is great and I'm sure the heated seats will be nice this winter. We started around 32-33 MPG and the last 2 tanks have been 35+. We drive 85% highway @ 80 MPH. The engine power isn't bad considering we live +7k feet elevation. It should be more than adequate everywhere else in the country. Maybe not as quick as the competitors (mazda3) but a great car!,3
1274,"Need car after 10 yrs w/Infiniti. Considered many others, 4 & 6 cyl. Avalon smoothest suspension & plenty of amenities; seems as if it's on Lexus LS platform, w/o the price or quite the cache-but also w/o premium gas requirement. Avg > 30 mpg on my first highway drive & overall ave. ~ 24.5 miles per gallon in mixed city and hwy driving. JBL 12 spkr very nice. Highly recommend.",3
1275,"We've only owned our 2007 Toyota Highlander for about 10 days but we love it. We ordered a Limited RAV4 months ago and got tired of waiting for that to arrive. We waited about 100 days after ordering, and were told that it might be 100 more days. We saw the Highlander -- hadn't really considered it because we drew the line on price and fuel efficiency previously in going with the RAV, but the price came down to the point we could afford it, and the gas mileage is acceptable, and the comfort is excellent. I'm a Toyota fan -- I drove a T-100 pickup to 230K miles with minimal expense. Although we're dissappointed with the non-availabiliy of the Limited RAV, it was a blessing in disguise --",3
1276,"This vehicle is one of the nicest 'Utility' vehicles that I've ever driven. It has a quiet and comfortable interior, and the suite of luxo-goodies doesn't hurt. The engine delivers power smoothly when requested. Handling is good and adds to the fun-factor, but the Edge is no sports car. It is heavy and, although the Edge maintains control, you feel that weight when you push the limits. Overall, a pleasure to drive. I appreciate its just-right size when compared to the larger boats like the GMC Acadia. With 800+ miles on mine, Mileage is OK at 19 MPG.",3
1277,"It rides very smooth. I enjoy the comfortable seats. I like all the extras! The wood grain center console and steering wheel are beautiful. I would like more storage available in the center console. I like that the vehicle uses 4 cylinders, until it needs the full 8. It helps with gas mileage.",3
1278,"Have driven Cadillacs for over 27 yrs, my last being a 2001 DHS. First Buick ever. My Buick Super is giving me excellent performance. No wind noise. Fuel economy is what is to be expected with a 292 HP Northstar engine, (20mpg city driving) and absolutely fun to drive. A great many options comes with this vehicle. I've also saved several thousand by buying the Buick over the Cadillac with just about all the same options. Completely satisified",3
1279,"Like most readers I've driven them all, but this one delivers a lot of bang for the buck. Does not handle like a 5 series, will not out accelerate a 550i, but it handles beautifully, is great on the road, and has an interior and audio system that puts the 5 series and E-Class to shame. Put that together with Acura's reputation for reliability and we have a BIG winner.",4
1280,Well - this is my 1st SUV. Was purchased pretty much for cross-country traveling. Rides much better than expected given that it is body-on-frame with a solid rear axle. Of course that is what gives the 4Runner true off-road capability which includes true 4-wheel LO with the ability to lock up the axles. Excellent tracking in rain and snow with at least a reasonable chance of getting out if you foul up and get stuck. Leather seats are comfortable and multi-adjustable. Good visibility and the LTD comes with a back-up camera that plays thru the nav system for a decent view behind you. Rear hatch closes electrically once you get close to avoid slamming. Not a rattle or a squeak,3
1281,"For the upper end of Impalas, this has been a real joke. The rattles and windshield leaks make you feel like you're watching an outdoor concert of bad music. Hit a pothole and OnStar wants to know if everyone in the car is OK--even though they think I'm about 80 miles from where I actually was . . . and they called back three times to verify that nothing was wrong. I listened to them more than the radio. Where do I find the fuse to kill that beast?",0
1282,"Drop dead gorgeous. Da Silva is a genius. This is my first Audi (but coincidentally, this is the 6th among my whole family). Almost bought the 3 series and then saw the A5 was coming out in the states. The outside is absolutely stunning, the inside design is beautiful but ridiculously comfortable. I drive 3 hours a day going to and from work and my commute couldn't be any more fun than it is now. Audi's made me a fan for life.",4
1283,First of all the only one i even considered is the mugen. Well why because i wont see hundreds of them on the road also because of the .92 g's on the skid-pad stereo rocks way better than what you think you would get for the money blows my 2008 vw r32 stereo out the water but let's get to business this car handles great. The eighteen inch mugen rims look awesome in the graphite look against the fiji blue paint which is by far the best color on the civic si. Great gas mileage so far about 27 mpg. Wonderful exhaust note especially when it hits vtec. About as fun as it can get for 28k which is a bit steep for any civic but i know the resale will be great go ahead buy one you will love it addictive,3
1284,"I picked up my new SR5 CrewMax yesterday. It is a gorgeous vehicle, Silver Sky exterior, with black leather interior. It seems to have very good road manners, tracks very straight and stops very straight. It is fast and very smooth, like a luxury sedan. It is also a big vehicle and you sit quite tall in the saddle. My truck is equipped with a lot of the extras that come standard on the CrewMax Limited, but my truck was $4300 less than a Limited, so I feel like I got a very good value for my money. The fit and finish are fantastic. It is the first vehicle I have ever owned where I can find no blemishes, interior or exterior.",3

1286,"I have owned 4 jeeps similar to this one. The jk has the smoothest ride so far. All the nice things in the ""S"" package are great. I was really shocked about the drips and wind noise- -the worst ever. But my local jeep dealer in Clarion, PA fixed the problems.",3
1287,"My 2000 Honda Civic was stolen and completely stripped and I was forced to purchase a new vehicle. I looked at the Chevy Aveo, the Nissan Versa, the Honda Fit, and the Yaris. The Yaris was the most affordable and I was able to get the options I wanted (i.e. alarm, car starter, ABS, power package). I enjoy driving this car and it is very comfortable for me. The only thing is, this little car can be quite noisy when switching gears and the ABS feel a bit ""mushy"" for a lack of a better word. I have 1,300 miles on my car right now and I am concerned I need to have the brakes checked. People have said that I am just use to a Honda which is a much quieter car with smoother braking.",3
1288,"I bought this car the same week the 2007 was available. It drives well, better than a Yaris. Its cheaper than a HONDA civic, its cheaper than the ALTIMA. Think about it this way, if you are in the market to buy a car that you need to use for your family and for traveling to work back and forth this thing is AMAZING! acceleration is good, fuel economy is great, if i had to give this car a grade on a scale of 1 - 10, it would be a 9.8 for sure.",4
1289,"This is my 4th Lexus and my first LS and it won't be my last. This is a true work of art and a brilliant machine. The car rockets from zero to 60, opens up and is cruise-like at 70 MPH plus. The ride is so quiet and serene it is easy to forget you are actually in a car even at high speeds. The LS is unbelievably quiet even at all speeds & in the city. Even driving at 50 MPH with the sun roof open is quieter than most vehicle with a closed sunroof. The interior is impeccable and is likely nicer than many living rooms you will encounter. The car surrounds you in luxury at every turn from the plush heated/vented seats and roomy feel to the easy to reach controls and tech features. Overall a gem.",4
1290,"I first saw a smart car in Rome were they were everywhere and immediately decided that when they/if they came to US, I would buy one. I am retired and only need a car for errands and short drives within a smallish town (Santa Cruz, CA). This is the perfect size for me, easy to park, fun to drive, good visibility, safe if anyone runs into me, and the heated leather seats are a bonus. Once I got used to the transmission, it is fine as long as you use manual mode and not auto. I have only had it for 2 weeks but I have not found any downsides to it yet.",3
1291,"This car is just OK, but not comfortable at all. Very small trunk, can't fit a small suitcase. Very hard to take anything out of the trunk. Heating does not work well.",2
1292,"Love this FX35! This replaced the Volvo XC90 as I have safety, stored the Carrera as I have the power, performance and fun, gave the MDX to hubby, as I have the comfort, style and loaded features all in one car!! Handles like a dream, very comfy, beautiful as all get out! Love all the bells and whistles moreover the price.. not bad. Wish MPG was better however I won't compromise its performance. I wish I can keep this car a secret but people are catching on! This is the sports package of a BMW M for SUVs with the safety rep of a Volvo for us soccer moms!",4
1293,"I read all of the guru's comments as well as consumers. Believe the CONSUMERS. I own BMW's, Hummers2's,Cadillacs,Corvettes and now a GREAT Suzuki XL7. While being a low cost vehicle I purchased one, and found it to be exciting to drive with 33mpg hwy first time driven with exciting performance! Comfortable ride,roomy,and one of the best buy vehicles in the market. The warranty is second to none, and you will be pleased with the cost of purchase too! Sometimes the guru's compare to many cars to really understand what people are looking for. And try and compare apples and oranges. BUY ONE",4
1294,"I bought this vehicle as a family vehicle for my daughter and I. It has met all of our needs. Interior is comfortable. Exterior is an attractive, sleek design. Turning radius is not the greatest. Factory headlights are not as bright as the headlights in my Ranger were. The back glass rattles. I agree with the post indicating that the water from teh wiper blades blows right inside when the window is down. Never had that happen before in any other vehicle. Lower gas mileage than I was told at teh dealership. But those are teh only negatives. Everything else about the vehicle is a positive. Most reliable vehicle I have ever had.",4
1295,"I've only had it a couple of days but I am really happy I purchased it. Holds my kids and all our junk. Comfortable seats and driving position. Enough power for passing. Much quieter than 04 CR-V and 98 Camry. Haven't used SYNC yet, but will soon. I'm adding a trailer hitch for light towing (Only rated for 2000lbs). Good looking interior. First American car I've ever had, owned VW, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, and Toyota. I hope it hold up well.",3
1296,"My husband and I love our new X3. We were originally going to go with the Volvo XC90, but after test driving the X3, we loved it. It handles better than the XC90 and it's cheaper.",3
1297,By far this is the best SUV on the market not just for the buck but for the features. So much interior room. The platinum edition feels like owning a Lexus with out the huge payment.,4
1298,"I researched this vehicle before buying and found that all but one were great ratings. The one bad stated that he had electrical problems from the very beginning. Well, I am the second. After only 10 months, the alarm would trigger when ever I unlocked and opened the door. They replaced a circuit card. Then, the steering wheel would not tilt. They replaced the switch twice and then the steering column. Then it would not tilt nor telescope so they replaced a circuit card. Three weeks later, it's doing it again. The DVD volume is much louder than the radio and they can't fix it. The fan under the hood is very loud sometimes. I am getting lots of rattles and wind noise now.",1
1299,I purchased my 2008 Acura TL Type S in April. 4 months later I am still very happy. Excellent acceleration and the gas mileage is surprisingly good. I've been averaging 27 mpg with city/hwy combined. Luxury and sport nicely combined. The TL offers more leg room for rear passengers than the IS 250 and G35. I wish the back seats were capable of folding down for my random stops at Lowes and Home Depot. The doors are hard to keep open while exiting but I will survive.,3
1300,"My wife previously drove a Jeep Liberty. She loved that Jeep, but we were running out of space. We shopped around for minivans. The Hyundai was the only one she said she would give up her Jeep for. We like everyting about this van. The engine has great power, the seats are comfortable, very quiet on the road with very little wind noise on the highway, and a awesome stereo system. Three zone climate control is great too. Fit and finish was what was the desiding factor between this and an Odyssey. The new Odyssey's interiors looked and felt cheeper. Entourages fit and finish is unsurpassed. Two things the Honda has over this: VCM (better mpg) and a more refined transmission.",3
1301,"I love my new CX-9. I had no intention of buying a Mazda - stumbled on the CX-9 by chance. This car handles better than any competitive model I drove. The interior styling and features are very well thought out. The car is so functional - my car is loaded with navigation, Bluetooth phone capability, iPod connection, dual climate controls, etc. Because the spare tire is under the car, versus in the trunk, the third row seats easily fold flat with the tug of a strap and one smooth movement. And the bonus, there is plenty of leg room for the passengers in the third row.",3
1302,"I had a choice between going with 07 SEL w/ leather & spoiler and a 08 SE for the same price. I went with the 08 SE since it had better safety ratings. The car is beautiful on the outside and inside. The only few points off is: 1) the plastic inside look somewhat cheap, especially noticeable at the fan grilles. 2) the phone bluetooth button does not work without sync, which I did not know otherwise I would have bought a model with sync. (I never asked) The maintenance is nice, oil schedule is every 7500 which is a plus from every 3000 miles that I'm used to. The car handles and rides very smoothly. It's power output is definitely better than our other 4cyl Saturn.",3
1303,I just bought a Fit in April. It is not only the best small car I've every owned. It's the best car I've ever owned. The interior is roomy and does not fill like you are in a sub compact vehicle. The performance that Honda gets out of it's 1.5 liter engine is amazing. I can also haul things in this vehicle that I had trouble hauling in my Chevy Impala. Thank You Honda for a great vehicle.,4
1304,"I'm still on the first tank of gas on my Elantra SE, but so far I'm very pleased with it. Rides very well on city streets and highway. Feels bigger than my Mazda3, but not as big and floaty as a Sonata. It's the perfect size for myself and my family. Pickup is good and gas mileage is in the high 20s on the first tank - sure to get even better with time. Very high-quality interior, though I wish it were a lighter gray (it's a nearly-black charcoal gray interior). A much better car than the previous-generation Elantra.",3
1305,"We bought this car to replace a 2000 Honda Accord sedan. Terrible car. The Honda's transmission cratered at 84k, which is NOT what you expect from these manufacturers. It left her and my kids stranded three times with its unreliability. Thanks Honda. 
This is my wife's car. The one primarily used for kid transport, groceries, errands, and such. Where we live, it's 50 miles to Walmart, Our Tahoe has been the trip vehicle. Well, that may change now with this car. 
We brought the 2007 Accord to the Nissan dealership to compare them side by side, and the Nissan won, hands down. Many more features, better looks, more comfort. Wife loved the car. If Momma's happy...",3
1306,"Plenty fast enough for daily driving, gives me an average of 33 mpg at 75 mph cruise control on long drives. It's not necessarily ""sporty"" compared to actual sports cars. It has stone hard economy tires and a soft luxury suspension. So take it for what it's worth or upgrade your tires and suspension. Looks are subjective but I still think it looks nicer than most cars even after the 4 years it's been in production.",3
1307,"4 months of owership now and am quite pleased with the car. In my review in 06/08 I mentioned I went from a Focus hatchback to the Escape since Ford discontinued the hatch, why? ask Ford, it was a great auto. The 4 cyl. is not for you if you like 0-60 in record time. It will get you to interstate speeds but not in a hurry, just fine for me. Cruises along very nicely. Cruise control smooth. Electric PS great. Lots of storage, cavernous with the back seat flat. 24+ MPG around town with AC. Seats I had described as a bit hard are now quite comfortable. Still miss a telescoping steering wheel but power driver seat gives a satisfactory position. All controls illuminated in blue at night, excellent.",3
1308,"Bought one. The day after buying my van, my wife and self made a 350 miles trip. We had a tire flat that could not be repaired. Being on Sunday all dealerships were closed. We found a retail store that sold the replacement tire, but was told that no tires were available(17"" wheel) from the factory. All available tires were used for the 2008 vans. We had to get a hotel room, to wait for a dealership to open(missing a day from work). The dealership was unable to get a new tire, but they found an old tire off a used vehicle. we were finally able to get home. While returning from a second trip the multifunction switch controlling the wipers and high beams went out(the wipers could not be turn off)",2
1309,"I've owned my 2008 Liberty for over 3 months now. Consumer Reports does no justice for the Jeep. The ride is great, smooth and comfortable. Interior is well fit together. This Jeep is great for traveling, camping and just getting around. Gas mileage could be better. Sticker range is 16- 22 but I get 18-24. Consumer Reports also says that the engine is week and difficult to pass on the open road. Found that NOT to be true at all. I'd recommend this over most in it's class.",3
1310,"I have posted when I first bought this car. Mostly all positive. Still a good car, but I will not buy another. I drive hard (80 to 85 mph) on the highway as my commute is 70 miles round trip to work. My mileage is average 28 mpg which is ok. Things that disappoint me.. 1-a/c in glovebox, but no light. 2-can not open drivers door and lock from inside (without key). 3-can not sit in the dark with only radio lights on. All lights including bright driving lights will be on. 4-hatch lock locks on its own free will (when your not ready) 5-outlet and mp3 jack in glovebox (useless location) 6-no quick release to let seat down. The twist knob is poor choice, as I like to lean back. 7-expensive maintenance.",3
1311,"Just purchased and have 6000 miles so far. The car is everything I expected. Test drove MB, Infiniti, and Acura. Silky smooth, quiet, powerful, and comfortable all describe this car. Even the exterior design and look has compelled onlookers to offer favorable compliments. It's not one thing in a Lexus, it's the total package thats makes it a great buy.",3
1312,"Overall I really like my new purchase of the Toyota Yaris. The interior could have a few more features, like a temperature gauge and other normal stats. Its small compared to the average American vehicle, which makes it extremely easy to parallel park in smaller spots and to maneuver around things. It'd be nice to have some faster acceleration, but I guess thats just a trade-off for a car with good gas mileage.",3
1313,"Merry Christmas, my husband surprised me on christmas with this wonderful vehicle. Its been a week now, love the drive, the beauty of the vehicle. Negatives: based upon the cost, beauty and name alone - this vehicle should come with a much better sound systems, softer leather seats, and among all things the rear backing feature (this feature is standard in the Nissan Murano) where you can view backing up without having the standard navigational system. I love Lexus vehicles, this is our 3rd lexus - first SUV. Would I trade it for something else??? NAWW.... Though the new Acura MDX did catch my eye!",3
1314,"This is the 3rd Hyundai I have owned since 1999. The first 2 were great cars. I got the GLS 4 cylinder with the 5 speed manual trans. Even though this is the cheapest model it still comes with all the safety features as standard. The car drives great, quiet and smooth. Very comfortable and roomy. I am getting 32 MPG with this car, I guess the 5 speed helps here. I averaged 35 MPG with my much smaller Elantra. This is excellent economy for such a large car. Pretty quick for a four cylinder too. I love the stereo, burned a CD with 125 MP3's and the stereo played them perfectly. Just a great value in a mid size car.",3
1315,Just bought it and am very pleased with our choice. On the first trip bringing it home we got 40 mpg with Canadian gallons. The 2.7 liters have enough snap and yet holds onto the economy. The visibility is great. The interior is bright and easy to enter and exit. The controls are convenient and easy to understand. Having gone from a Jeep Grand Cherokee to the Sebring we had some reservations but to this date we made the right decision.,3
1316,"Just bought the 2008 SE Armada last week and love every driving minute. Interior is big and roomy, with lots of quality features. Exterior is bold and brawny, turning many heads with each passer by. Wife loves the security of transporting kids in such a safe vehicle. Previous to this purchase, we owned 2005 Pathfinder and never had a single issue.",3
1317,"The GPX is amazing! This is the first roadster that I have owned and I am very happy with my choice. The Solstice is the only car that I have been able to drive comfortably. I am a large person (6 ft 325 lbs) with a very long torso. Other cars I have looked at did not have the hip room and head room that I needed. The Solstice has both. One other car I looked at had so little room, I looked OVER the windshield when seated in the car and I could not close the door because it hit my leg. Other than being very comfortable in the Solstice, it is really fun to drive. Other reviews complain about the meager trunk space, all I can to say is this car was only meant for hauling - well you know!!",3
1318,"If money were no object, some relatively minor improvments would make the Aveo a contender. So, for the price paid ($10,400 brand new off the lot!), this car was a fantastic deal. Since new, and now with 11,000 miles, only two minor problems: a tire pressure sensor went on one wheel. No biggie. This was repaired by the dealer with no issues. Developed a front-end shudder due to improper lug torque on both front wheels. Again, an easy fix. Design and build quality is excellent. Seams are even and tight. Not a squeak or rattle has developed. Motor remains perky and trouble-free (easy starts, no stalls). There is a buzz in the gas pedal over 60 mph, but have learned to deal with it.",3
1319,"We absolutely luv to drive our Tribeca. Have taken on two long trips and will not give up the wheel. Visually styling is distinct and pleasing. Interior cockpit feels young and vibrant. Exterior side and rear view especially is downright cool. No issues thus far in 16K miles except Nav system freeze up, but replaced immediatly. Mechanically sound as Lexus or Acura.",3
1320,"Our problems began after 4 months and less than 3000 miles when a p.s. hose burst on Jan 21/08. Dealer said it was probably water in the p.s. hose that froze and burst the line! No hoses available in N.A. so dealer finally stripped a new vehicle to get us going after a week. Second p.s. hose burst Feb. 13 causing smoke and fumes to enter our vehicle while driving! P.S. hose replaced again. Feb 21, 3rd hose ruptures, radiator is leaking antifreeze, transmission leaking oil and various electrical problems occurring. Still waiting on parts and without the use of our Vue for almost 2 months . Dealer does not know what is causing the problems. We are very very disappointed with this vehicle.",0
1321,"The RL is a magnificent machine, and far and away the best value in its class. It is cram packed with cool technology and the AWD delivers amazing handling in all kinds of weather. Fit and finish are supurb. This car puts a smile on my face every day on the way to work each morning and tempts me to take the ""long way"" home each night. Highly recommended.",4
1322,This is a great riding vehicle with good space. I love the amenities and that it uses regular gas. The transmission stinks. It's always searching and you have to tromp it just to keep up with rural traffic but on the highway it's fine. Gas mileage has been 14mpg commuting and 22mpg on the highway. It is a very quiet riding vehicle though.,3
1323,My Rondo is so nice to drive and it is great to not be a mini van mom any longer but still have the room. I will miss the cargo room though that my van had if we have 7 passengers. When it is just the four of us and the dog we are comfortable for a long trip.,3
1324,"This car is amazing! Style, performance, and quality are all 10. The 4cyl turbo is great, plenty of kick to it. Peformance and economy, my last fill up was averaged at 30mpg. I was hesitant to purchase an automatic, what's the fun of a sports car that you can't shift? However, the paddle shifters are a lot of fun, and make up for a spouse that can't drive stick. The top drops smooth and speedy. Nice to be able to put it up or down when moving. The launch control feature is a blast! It will light the tires up like it had 400 horses under the hood. Great in the snow as FWD only.",3
1325,"Traded my 2007 Explorer, have owned this car about 2 weeks and everything has gone OK. The oil filter protector (under the car) got broken in the first 5 days of having it! I don't know how it happened but some how it got snagged by something and broke! Gas mileage is alright, Im only getting 20.6 MPG but being new and mostly stop and go traffic its to be expected. Other than that its fun to drive (love taking those curves at higher speeds) good build quality, though the black interior needs special care or it will dry out and look dry/sun bleached. Have the sport package and the bigger wheels and suspension makes everyday driving a little harder but its great for the value! Overall I love the car!",3
1326,I've owned my '07 E350 with the no-cost sport option for 30 days and I could not be happier with it. I hope it is reliable. So far so good. I purchased the extended 7 year warranty. My '97 E320 was very unreliable and gave me a lot of problems.,3
1327,"I have owned this car since 1/1 and had nothing but problems with the front suspension. This car has very weak front springs especially the right side bottoms out with every bump in the road, inclined driveways forget about it. The front underside has taken a beating with such a weak suspension. Has been in the shop numerous times but to no avail(so far). Dealership has replaced front strut, aligned it and reposition a strut also to rid itself of a loud popping noise on the left front side. Will go back in the shop next week. Springs are so weak I can compress them with a single hand Fuel mileage I find above average, great dash and readouts, comfortable seats(do not spill on them).",1
1328,"This auto was the best in the price range that we test drove. Great features including sunroof, leather, and reclining rear seats. Has great leg room in the rear passenger area.",3
1329,"I traded in my 2003 Pathfinder LE for this vehicle. I was no longer towing heavy trailers so I didn't need it. I am 6'1"" at 185 lbs, plenty of room. This car has much more head and leg room than my wife's 2003 Sentra. Fuel economy was much lower than the EPA estimates but still acceptable. The fit and finish is very good for this price category.",3
1330,"I purchased an '07 RAV4, February, 2008, used, from a Toyota dealer, replacing a '01 Ford Taurus. Bought a 4 cyl, fwd. Use for daily commuter and weekend chores. Occasional trips. Just recently, averaged 27.5 mph at a steady 75 mph on a 500 mile round-trip. Around town, am getting 22 to 24 mph. As a daily driver, the car is excellent. Perfect for weekend chores. The swing rear door does cause some problems while carrying lumber, however, I knew that when I purchased the vehicle. Otherwise, car is perfect for intended use. Am very pleased with performance, handling, and overall build.",3
1331,"I love this car. It drives smooth, is amazing on ice and snow and is just as nice to look at as the Acura everyone else seems to own here in Alaska. I was surprised at how quick it accelerates and it purrs at 70 to 75 mph. The Bluetooth is a feature that I will never live without. For the $ I paid ($24K) I feel like I got the best car for the money. I smile every time I drive it. Dealership support also has been fantastic.",4
1332,"Great car. Comfortable smooth, sports car handling, excellent craftsmanship incredible power. Not as quiet as the gas engine but very quiet for a diesel. You have to listen to hear it. I average 25mpg, as much as 38 mpg on the road. However the GPS stinks. It's the worst. Difficult to use and I dont need to find ""border crossings"" in the USA. Just buy a Garmin, a 100 times better. Problems: transmission tends to clunk into lower gear as you slow down. Had a 2005 Benz with the same problem. Price of diesel a negative. Hate the center console, holds nothing. Service very expense. I would however, buy this car again.",3
1333,"Mileage has risen from 13 to 16 for primarily city driving with 1100 mi. on odometer. I'm hopeful that when we drive 400+miles roundtrip on highway soon it will rise further. No negative issues have cropped up, but I have now noticed some rather cheap finishing on exterior trim. Other than those two things, I'm still very happy with it.",3
1334,"This is my first Toyota and what a wonderful experience. I am a 48 year old grandmother who still needs a little fun in her life. This vehicle fits the bill of not too large and not too small. Perfect for taking my children to college, loading groceries and simply a blast to drive. Would highly recommend this car-based vehicle to everyone. Past loves have been Expeditions, minivans and a sport car. Best value and so much more. I appreciate the car more each day. Even my honda loving husband of 24 years enjoys driving it! I love the stares when I drive it!!",4
1335,"I've enjoyed my first month of owning my new CX-7. It is a beautiful vehicle and it has carried me through 6"" of snow and a blinding rainstorm already. I test drove many other vehicles in this category but the Mazda was, by far, the most fun to drive. That consideration was not at the top of my priority list, but it's superiority there outshined some of the smaller disadvantages. One thing I wish I had known was just how poor the gas mileage is. My vehicle is returning 13mpg in the city and about 19 mpg on the highway. I'm not even sure how a 4 cyl engine can possibly return such poor numbers. I recommend the vehicle with the caveat that you must be willing to accept poor gas mileage.",3
1336,"Low end torque is not as good as i had hoped. above 2500 rpm the car moves well. The manual side on the 5A is sluggish, upshifts are not crisp. The engine has some noticeable vibrations at 1500 rpm, 2000 rpm and 4000 rpm. The 2000 rpm point is most noticeable at takeoff, it is felt in the steering wheel and foot pedals.",2
1337,"Great car, had Hondas previously and like the Versa so much better, and the top of technology put into it and having a look of a European car. In black it's really cool looking, drives great and has a great sound system. You never see the hood of the car, you look out your windshield and only see the road, really different then any car I've ever driven.",3
1338,Bought this as a replacement for my 2001 crew cab duramax. I was a little worried about if it would be able to tow my 12000 lb trailer since it has the 6 liter gas engine. As it turned out it has no problem whatever towing it and the 6sp allison tranny is a joy. The mileage could be a little better but since regular gas is alot cheaper here than diesel it works out alright. I especially like the built in trailer braking system instead of having the aftermarket unit hanging under the dash. After 20000 miles I have not had a single problem with this truck . It is as tight and quiet as the day I bought it. I only use it for towing our 35 ft camper. Again love this truck.,4
1339,Traded a 2006 Equinox LT for 2008 LTZ. Wanted an SUV with GPS. This is the best deal on the market for features and upgrades included. Very comfortable ride. Gas mileage is acceptable.,4
1340,"I originally posted a review in September just after I bought the car. I figured since I've been driving it for 7 months and 15,000 miles I'd post an update. I appreciate this car more each day! I've been averaging a shade under 51 mpg over the 15,000 miles. Interstate MPGs (75mph variety) drop the car to about 45 mpg so I stopped taking it. I live about 50 miles from my job and it takes me about an hour to get there. Very comfortable car with lots of head room and shoulder room. This car far exceeded my expectations.",3
1341,"I was going to buy a Lexus RX350 but told the salesman that I had another appointment at the Volvo dealership that morning. I would most probably come back to close the deal with him after the appointment. After a test drive of Volvo XC90, I changed my mind right away. The car felt smooth, sturdy, and macho, having an excellent road grip at highway curves. I have driven the car for almost 5 months since then and never had a problem with its workmanship. Believe it or not, it is also a head turner on highway. One major complaint I have about the car is gas mileage, so far I have 14.8 m/g. Another complaint is its slow acceleration, but I have learned to live with that.",3
1342,"First vehicle I ever bought. Family has always owned Dodge with no problems. I have owned the vehicle for 7 mo and has been in the shop 7 times (mainly due to unreliable technicians). I have a squeek in the dash and passanger door that just wont go away. Recenly the bed of the pickup is offset from the passanger compartment. Also, after 2 hrs of driving the MDS doesn't know what to do (vehicle is constantly surging with the flucuating RPM's).",1
1343,"This SUV has all the bells and whistle that you would want and need. Drives and handles very well. I've owed several SUVs, hands down it's the best so far. Love all the new upgrades in the 08.",4
1344,"Start with my X5 has only 3500 miles in it, at 2000 miles engine light came, per mechanic something wrong with catalytic converter, failed fan just recently while traveling in freeway a small rock or pebble hit my front panel creating a quarter sized hole, side panel just behind headlight is made with composite or some kind of plastic.",1
1345,Have recently purchased the 2007 Maxima SE. Before that had a 2005 Altima SE. The Maxima offers great features with a smooth transmission (CVT). Very comfortable car to drive as I put on a lot of KM per year. Nice finishing touches inside Maxima logo inside evry door chrome acents. Drove a few luxury sedans G35 TL and pricing and options on the Maxima SE matched others and own 2 other Nissans 1986 300ZX turbo (my fun summer car) and 2005 Xterra.,3
1346,"I've looked over the internet an have reviewed many comparison among so call luxury sedans and the comments shared here, and what I am finding is that most people really have not driven the new S-80, 287hp, AWD,T6. I have had mine now for 19 months. If you desire sport and comfort it's a excellent choice. However, not many autos can compare to the ride the Lexus 350S in comfort, but the Lexus lacks speed, handling and power. It also is a (front wheel drive)car. However, the combination of power, and torque will change your mind about the S-80 AWd/T6, it will run with a 7 series BMW. Do you hear me!!!!!!!!!!!! Two months ago I raced a 7 series and KEPT PACE, UP TO 120MPH for 100 yds",4
1347,"It's been a long time that an American made car company has produced such a sweet car. We picked the ocean mist color. It's so cool. It has the chrome finish inside. The wood grain was a bit cheap looking. I would only change two things, improve the turning radius from 40 feet to 35 feet.The other thing put a lght in the glove compartment. Other than that she rides similar to my BMW 330CI. Not the same but stiff and very little leaning in turns.The power plant is the same as Caddy CTS. In conclusion I would recomend this hot car to anyone interested in a new fresh design and a car with get up and go yet still gets 29 miles to the gallon. And it is made in America by Americans.",4
1348,"I recently purchased the '07 Tundra. I've had it about 3 weeks now. It's the Limited, DoubleCab, 6.5' bed, 5.7 V8, 4x4. This truck is amazing. I've only ever owned F150s ever since I learned to drive. What a change this truck is. The power and handling is amazing. Not only does it corner like a sports sedan, but it will stop shorter than any truck I've ever driven. The engine and transmission are smooth and quiet. When you want the power though, it does come to life and lets you know it. Good thing for the traction control or the tires would only spin. Gas mileage isn't bad. I'm getting 18.5 mpg on the highway and 14.5 mpg in the city. That's driving sensibly though.",4
1349,Have owned the truck for 2+ months so far and love it! Have the 6.7 L Cummins Turbo Diesel. With only 3500 miles so far I was getting 18-19 Hwy Mpg on a recent vacation trip. I expect to do much better once the engine is broken in. The exhaust brake is awesome and a big help when pulling a trailer in mountainous terrain. MegaCab provides roomy comfort for the entire family. Four Wheel drive in the sand at Cape Hatteras was no problem at all. I found that the slightly stiffer ride on the road really paid off when the wheels left the pavement. It handled the bumps off road with ease and gave excellent off road performance. btw - The stiffer ride goes away with a trailer or payload too.,3
1350,"Great performance, have to check the mirrors to see if the car hauler is still behind me when I'm towing. Interior seems smaller than my '04 but still comfortable. A little too much bling with the chrome bumpers and the bulges in an attempt to make it look bigger than it really is. Had the front bumper painted black to match the body color. Looks a lot cleaner.",3
1351,"I've heard a lot of negative comments about previous year models, but I've had no problems with my Equinox. It's roomy, but not to big to manuever. Back seat is great. Great options and decent gas mileage.",3
1352,"The new 2008 Ford Taurus is definitely a step up from my previously owned 2005 Ford Five Hundred. From acceleration, to handling, to quietness, the Taurus is much improved over the Five Hundred. The attention to detail in the interior cabin design was greatly enhanced, the seats are still the most comfortable we have found in this class car, and in at least a dozen other ways, great and small, the car is an improvement over the Five Hundred basic concept. The gas mileage is a bit disappointing, but I enjoy the new power and feel of the engine! The '08 Taurus is a winner!",3
1353,"This vehicle was acquired in Jan 08. The worst winter in recent times for Michigan soon made it painfully obvious that the high performance Pirelli Rosso tires are not proper for locales that receive any measureable amount of snow. These tires immediately become road slicks and the vehicle will go nowhere. On dry or wet pavement, they are outstanding. Potholes are deadly for any tire, but for these Pirellis, it is certain immediate bankruptcy!",2
1354,"I purchased the car 4/11/08 and have almost 7000 miles on it already. The power is great (for a hybrid). So far I wish for a bigger trunk, but I knew that before I purchased it. Braking is top notch and I have never needed more power in passing or on hills. I drive mainly freeway to work and road trips. My gas mileage has been 30-32 mpg avg. I have seen as high as 37 mpg but like I said I drive pretty fast. I average 75-90 on the freeway. The car is very solid at all speeds but does very poorly up to speed with wind.",3
1355,"Having been a Ford Pickup owner for several years, I was not sure how a Saturn would fit into the equation. When I first saw this car, I was hooked. I test drove other cars, but my mind always went back to the Aura. I did not think I would really fall for this car, but was I wrong. Everything about it is great! The ride is smooth and quiet and the steering wheel controls are a plus. Driving this car is a highlight of my day!",4
1356,I just recently purchased a 2008 Camry LE. I love it so far. I like the brightness of the dashboard and the exterior design. It rides smoothly and I am still on the same tank of gas that the care came with and I purchased it 2 weeks ago. I would highly recommend this car to anyone!,4
1357,"I've had it for a year now and still love it as much as I did when I drove it off the lot. I especially love the interior design and dash layout. It is very classy and well organized. The performance is also pretty amazing. Stepping down hard on the gas makes me forget I am in a crossover. The dealer is great and has always been very detail-oriented when appeasing their customers. I definitely recommend it if cargo space is not your highest priority, but you don't want to restricted to a smaller sedan.",3
1358,"I knew with a Honda you couldn't go wrong and when I saw this generation Civic's body style, I knew I would eventually own one. I'm glad I waited until 2008 for the leather model as it looks A-mazing in silver w/ black interior. Fun to drive, great looks, Honda reliability...the end.",3
1359,"I have driven a minivan and two Suburbans over the last 14 years. We were able to downsize as our oldest is going to college. This vehicle is a wonderful change of pace. I love the size, drive and features. I fill it with kids several times a week and it is very comfortable as well as easy to lay down seats and haul anything from girl scout cookies to landscaping material. We shopped both the Acadia nad the Enclave. Would have bought another Chevy but it has not come out yet. Huge selection at the Saturn dealership with the features we wanted.",3
1360,"This car is a great little car! We sold her 2004 Prius to get this one. She was not getting to take advantage of the gas mileage on the Prius for the payment we were paying. So I sold it on ebay for $3000 more than we owed and bought the Yaris. What a deal. The payment was half and the mileage is about the same as she was getting. And the insurance is less. Plus, in 48 months the car will be paid for, just in time for our youngest to take it to college! The oldest get my Prius. lol The Yaris is very fun to drive I like to drive it when I get the chance.",3
1361,"For me driving in major snow storms is a given. This vehicle does everything you need it to do and feels rock solid. I drove through a monster storm this morning and to a ski resort last week on poor road conditions. I was never concerned.It tracks the road, is very stable and in the worst storm is balanced and steady. Unlike some larger SUVs I have had, the size and weight distribution on this vehicle provides a feel for the road surface and an ability to get you there. This vehicle is for someone who wants a smaller suv that can get you around in the worst of conditions. And of course, its a BMW so it goes without saying that the interior, the reliability and the extras are fantastic",3
1362,"I've been looking to buy a new Corvette for about 3 months. With GM reporting a sales decrease of 45% for October, I knew now was the time to pull the trigger. I bought the machine silver 2008 convertible with titanium interior and a black top. It looks great in the garage and I smile everytime I open the garage door. Absolutely no buyer's remorse. The only reason I gave the interior design a 9 is because I can't plug my MP3 into the stereo... what's that all about? The NPP dual mode exhaust is cool as hell and the magnetic selective ride rocks. If you're thinking at all about buying one of these, don't wait any longer. Now's the time do get a great deal on a great American sports car.",3
1363,"I owned this wagon for about 9 months and made about 16,000 miles. Had a few long trips (2,000-4,000 miles). I love this vehicle! It?s very reliable, especially in complicated driving conditions. Well, Volvo is known about this, but this car is exceptional. I love to it on sharp bends, especially on wet road. So far I could make anybody in this conditions feel absolutely safe. It took my wife quite a time to trust this car for she used to drive a family sedan. She simply could not believe that the car can do such things. I?ve tried to convince her to use it for me to be nor worried about her. The seats are excellent. I?ve some problems with low back but I can easily drive it.",4
1364,"This is my first Mitsubishi...and I love the way it rides and handles. The 160 HP 4-cylinder engine is very peppy. I bought it instead of the ""6"" for better fuel economy. I'm getting about 22 - 23 MPG in mostly city driving. It is very roomy inside. The back seat has a lot of leg room. It has air bags everywhere. Plus it has a 5 star front and side impact rating from the government. I like that. Try it, you'll like it.",3
1365,"After test driving some Japanese makes (you can imagine which ones), I finally made it to the VW dealer, and it felt like I had been driving go- karts all day! This felt so solid and drove so well. I loved the tiptronic transmission and the VW signature blue and red display on the dashboard! The mileage this car gives is also very respectable. This was the last car I test drove. The 6'6"" salesman opened the driver's door wide open when we got back to the dealer, hung himself from the door for about 7 seconds, and then closed the door. It closed as if nothing had happened. He looked at me, smiled and said: ""Do not try this on a Japanese!"" I thought this was a funny remark. I love my Jetta!!!",4
1366,"I rented this car for a week while decided which car to buy. While I've decided to wait until Toyota releases their next-gen battery, the 2008 Prius I drove was absolutely wonderful. I commute 50 miles round trip to work each day, and averaged 40 mpg during my commute. It was also comfortable and had all the creature comforts I could want. My only complaint is that as a 5'6"" driver, the bar across the back makes it difficult to see out the back window at times. If buying, I would opt for the rear view cameras. Otherwise, worth every penny. As soon as those lithium batteries come out, I'll be trading in my Honda Fit for a super eco and fuel friendly Prius.",3
1367,"This car is awesome! I never thought I would own a Hyundai and was persuaded to test drive this by my girlfriend and am soooo glad I did. I love the styling, comfort, value and incredibly smooth ride. I test drove just about every small SUV and this was the clear winner!",4
1368,Really like overall style plus the fit and finish is quite good. Car handles well and has enough power for the average driver. Not broke in yet with under 800 mls. Hope to average between 30 & 32 on the road after break in period.,3
1369,"I was going to buy a Mazda3 but the dealer didn't give me enough on my trade in so I went to look at the corolla and I saw the TC and thought it was a 26k car, I had never seen it before or known scion made it, I knew I wanted it right away and bought it the next day. I'm very happy with it but the seats are very uncomfortable, im 6'2. It needs lumbar support. But honestly for 18k you cant get much more with out stealing it.",3
1370,"I only have a few hundred miles on it. It is well made with nice internals and a few bugs. Complicated not-so-friendly navigation system. One must learn the exact commands (over 100 of them) to handle it safely and efficiently while driving. There is information missing on streets that have been in existence for many (7) years. If that is to be programmed one needs to look up MAP-IT beforehand and find the major intersection.. The engine require synthetic MOBIL-1 oil, and a higher octane gasoline. Trunk is large enough but be prepared to purchase the cargo net.",3
1371,It was time to get out of my minivan phase and into a sedan. I spent way too much time checking out the Japanese cars and ended up with the Aura. You get a wide variety of features for the money that just wasn't available on the competitors (unless I wanted to pay thousands more). And the Aura's styling and comfort are first rate. The power in this car will stand up to anyone.,3
1372,"This is my first Hyundai and I'm very happy with the vehicle so far. Had thoroughly reviewed and test-driven several crossovers, including the Highlander, CX-9, Veracruz and Pilot. Overall, Veracruz offered the most options, the best warranty, and the highest bottom line value. I'm getting about 16/23 MPG city/highway, which is not bad at all given the vehicle size. If you're in the market for a comfortable mid-size crossover at bargain price, you have to test-drive the Veracruz.",3
1373,"I leased my Black 6-speed manual GLI starting in March and absolutely love the car. I really wanted a GTI, but the dealer didn't have any, and the test drive of the GLI sold me. The engine is perfect for this car, and the gas mileage is surprisingly good considering the power the engine has (26-27 mpg for the first 1000 miles). The steering and handling feel tight, and the ride is very well controlled. Coming from a Honda, the VW's interior is worlds superior in terms of amenities and build quality. The interior lighting, interlagos cloth seats, HID headlights, red break calipers, 8-way adjustable seats and their comfort and details that really set this car apart. Recommended!",4
1374,Ahhhh - right now what I can say. It gets bad gas mileage and I have only 6706 miles on it and already had it in service department 3 times with window switches and engine light comes on. There is no power.,1
1375,"Just bought an '07 Rendezvous about 6 months ago and I love it! Great for hauling the family. A little slow, but extremely comfortable and functional. Great vehicle GM!",3
1376,"The first 3 months, this van was in the dealership off and on for 7 weeks. The rattling noises in the windows and doors were so loud that my 5 year old son thought it was hailing outside on a sunny day. Overall, space is awesome. Dvd & Nav function w/o any issues. Rear view camera is strange & deceiving. Almost out of car seats and will definitely switch out to a less noisy SUV.",2
1377,"I bought this car because I was getting killed at the pump by my Nissan Titan. I love being able to drive by the gas stations instead of stopping to fill up. the car looks great, runs great, and am getting over 28 mpg. I plan to have this car in my stable till it craps out, which by the quality of it; I may crap out first. Its one peppy 4 banger!!",4
1378,First Chevy I've owned. It's very roomy and comfortable. Love sitting high up on the road!!!,4
1379,"Got a great deal on the SE V6. Extremely comfortable, very roomy even in the back seat. Love the safety features you get that are standard that many other manufacturers charge extra for. Great trunk space. Love the sound of the stereo, especially XM, with the exception of the readout...could be better as it truncates the info. MPG in city driving is so-so at this point. Great power, smooth ride. I just wish it had a sunroof, but I couldn't argue with the deal that I got. As I stated, best vehicle I've owned yet!!",4
1380,"In 2006, our family purchased our first Sportage. It was Jade Green and I loved it so very much. Due to rising gas prices, we recently went on the lookout for a better commuter vehicle and, while impressed with the looks and mileage of the Kia compacts, we went right back to a new Sportage. This one is silver gray and happily accepted by the whole family. We love the safety it offers, the height, and the roomy interior. I'm sure we will always go to the Kia Sportage as new vehicles are required by our family. My only issue is the ESC Off light came on as we drove it home from the dealership. Will call immediately to have it fixed.",3
1381,i love it! It is awesome! My kids loveit. It drives great and handles well. Great car for the price. Iplan on having this car for a long time. thanks very much.,4
1382,"This is the worst vehicle I have ever owned. Passenger window rattles, brakes are poor, seat is hard and uncomfortable, radio sound quality is dismal. Also the paint is rough to the touch as though it has dirt embedded in it. The steering wheel does not return to the on center position without assistance. I read all the reviews before purchasing and cannot believe that they were mostly positive. Perhaps the higher models are more comfortable.",0
1383,"We were looking at the Acacia when the dealer showed us the Rainier. The value for the Rainier was exceptional. We towed our boat on a 2,000 mile excursion through the Sierras and it pulled with very little problem. Comfortable seats, quiet and smooth ride. The fold back rear seat headrests help with vision when no one is riding in the back. The built in air compressor is a plus. urning radius is very tight.",3
1384,"I have 8 2007 Passats that I use as TaxiCabs. 3 engines and 4 transmissions have already gone. Granted, we put alot of miles on it, but the turbo engine just does not stand up. Computer requires multiple visits to the dealer for reflash and these cars are absolutely draining the company wallet. Ive always owned Audis and VW's and never had so much trouble. Absolute money pit.",0
1385,"This is a great looking truck, the best I think. That is the main reason I bought the FX4. The interior is great, has so much room in there I compare it to an SUV. Fuel economy cold be much better, and it is costly to drive these days, but as a owner of a single cab 02 V6 F150, then upgrading to this 5.4 V8, I can see that Ford did get better in its fuel economy, but hey, if you drive such a big truck, you better expect the gas to be high. I have noticed some things that i dont like about it, but all Fords at all dealerships had the problems, one being they roll back on a slope, the other being the steering wheel shakes a bit too much for my liking at speeds of about 70mph.",3
1386,"Bought it over a month ago and have been extremely pleased with it. I was initially in the market for the A4 and test drove it couple of times. Although the A4 drives well, the 08 model felt a little cramped even in the front. The Infiniti dealership was right next door, so decided to stop in to test drive the G35. Was sold on it instantly. Great handling and power, not to speak of luxurious and (relatively) roomy interior. Reminded me of my friend's 924 that I used to occasionally drive couple of decades ago.",3
1387,I was disappointed in the ride. It sure didn't compare to my former Mercury Mountaineer. However the handling is very agile. Wish I had noticed how bland the car's exterior was in comparison to other suvs.,1
1388,"Just brought my new 2008 m3 cab home. Traded a 2008 P 911S cab. The M3 is faster and tighter with 19s and M drive. I am really juiced. Have had a 2007 P911 turbo, a bmw 645, and another P911S cab in the last 4 years, but this seems to hold its own with the turbo and beat the rest. More comfortable the the Porsche with incredible handling. M3 has satellite radio, something Porsche did not offer until 2009 and then at a very steep option price. And my insurance went down to boot!",3
1389,"It's no wonder that this vehicle is the number one selling suv in Europe. If you think gas is expensive here... wow. Tight handling, sits like it's a foot higher of the ground. Good acceleration,",3
1390,"i just love this car, sporty, great on gas, very affordable",3
1391,"We looked at other cars (Camry, Accord, Sonata) & Kia offered the most for the $ w/roomy interior, good mileage, lots of trunk space & 5 star front, rear & side impact ratings We opted for a fully loaded EX w/appearance pkg, convenience pkg & Electronic Stability Control. This includes leather & heated seats too! We got a great deal especially with the $3K cash back Kia offered So far the car has performed well. It handles very nice on the road. The interior is very quite at cruising speed, though the engine is heard when accelerating but it is not overbearing. Fit & feel are great, acceleration smooth. The interior to us was nicer style than others. Optima gets better more I drive it!",4
1392,"I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like this car. It's very roomy and quiet on the road with a lot of features not available on the competition. I have the mid-grade LT1, front wheel drive model. It's easy to see out of fore and aft, so driving, parking and backing up is easy. The gas mileage is great; I have been averaging over 20 city/hiway and it only requires regular gas. Given I have only the mid level model; it doesn't drive sporty but is pretty agile. However, it can feel tipsy in very windy driving conditions, which makes the steering feel a too light. Upgraded models might mitigate this. Lastly, while the seats are comfy, they are a bit too soft on long drives.",3
1393,"I have had my Sky for 4 months, and have 12,000 miles on it now. I bought the chili pepper red with black interior. Handles great. Everywhere I go, it turns heads. Have to take extra time everywhere I stop because of people wanting to look and talk about it. I haven't had any problems with it at all. Only taken it to the shop for oil changes and tire rotation. I am getting about 28mpg average. This surprised me. I love this car!",4
1394,"I have had my 2008 R32 since December 07. In February of 08 the car stalled on me at a red light, and the check engine light came on. I had to put the car in PARK to start it again. Several times after, the car hesitated on acceleration. I told my dealer about this problem and made an appointment. The car stalled on them 3 times on testing. It ended up being the fuel canister (it was soaked), and was replaced. I was given a rental car. I am now experiencing the same problem, and will be taking the car back to the dealer this week (4/18/08), for what I suspect is the same problem. Has anyone else had this problem w/ their 2008 R32? Could this be a design flaw?",2
1395,"This is my second QX56, the first being a 2005. I can not say enough on how great this vehicle is. Neither of my trucks has ever had a issue. The dealership provides free oil changes ever 3,500 and is a pleasure to deal with. The QX56 has just about everything a large, luxury SUV should have. So quiet, so powerful, yet nimble given its size.",4
1396,"I have 500 miles on my new Forester, so far I love it! Good power, 25 MPG mixed driving before break-in period, quick & sure handling and that hill holder function is seamless when I use it. The clutch and shift are hands down the smoothest I've ever driven, pleasant, easy manual to drive.The ride is comfy, heated seats are nice, the moon roof is awesome, stereo wth 6 CD is nice. The ride over washboard pavement is just a little hard but it floats over RR tracks with comfort and control and takes corners and clover leafs like a bear. It's an undercover sports car dressed up like a little SUV, winter ready. The PZEV rating is a nice plus for global non warming. Will rerate 5K,10K.",3
1397,"The 650 has what BMW calls an ""inherent characteristic."" If you drive in ""manual"" shift mode the vehicle is prone to stuttering when coming to a stop. Imagine your head bobbing back and forth like a doll on the dashboard. The vehicle is also prone to severe lunges when driving in m1 (such as you might in a parking garage looking for a spot or while moving forward in a metered freeway on ramp) and to a lesser extent in automatic. The lunges are dangerous and you must drive defensively at 4 miles per hour. BMW states the problem is with the software-it thinks the engine is stalling and the computer gives the engine throttle. BMW won't fix the problem. Stay away from this vehicle.",1
1398,"This is my 3rd Maxima.It is everything that I expected and more. My wife loves it.Acceleration is excellent.CVT is great although you have to get used to it in the beginning.No torque steer.Pleasant ride.Handling could be improved.Impressive gas mileage, even with only 2500 miles on it. Trunk storage is great and the rear seats fold down - unlike some Toyota models.Great looking-my neighbors and friends were very impressed.",4
1399,"I got mine a week ago and I love it. It is the first Suzuki that I've owned. I wasn't sure about the Suzuki brand, but it's great. It cost a total of $16,500 after tax, and what a great deal for that price. You get AWD, a nice interior, decent horsepower, and all of the safety features. In my opinion this is the best buy if you're looking for a car under $20,000. I looked at a few cars that were priced at $19,000 - $21,000 and this SX4 is as good if not better than them. I think for $16,000 this car is a steal. It looks great on the outside and inside. It has great headroom/legroom and a lot of trunk space. I was also pleasantly surprised by the speaker/audio quality. What a great buy.",4
1400,"I now believe I made a mistake buying this vehicle. I thought it was going to be a great investment. Not so. The gas mileage is poor and there is this extremely annoying wind noise on the drivers side. based on other commentary, it would seem that it can not be fixed. Yeah, the vehicle does not look great but we bought it for the features and the price. We are very disappointed and are looking at our options of getting something else. It does not handle particularly well on the road. It has a tendency to float and I can almost see the gas gage move. Like one other guy said, I guess you get what you pay for.",1
1401,"The car is everything you would expect from a Toyota. I have 10K on mine, it's been flawless. I have averaged about 40 mpg, and do a lot of highway driving. If I drove more in the city I could easily avg 42-44. The car teaches you how to drive it. Yes, it ultimatley means less aggressive driving, but that's not a bad thing. In fact I find I now drive my non-hybrid vehicles more conservatively. You really learn what burns the gas.",3
1402,"So after almost 5 months of ownership, I can say that I am truly impressed with the Entourage. All the forum complaints on the power doors, wheel vibration, battery drain, and gas mileage have not been part of my experience. They van has been flawless since day one, except for a crooked Entourage emblem and broken conversation mirror, both of which were fixed under warranty. If they still made the Entourage, I would be recommending it to everyone. I guess the Kia Sedona is the equivalent, but from what I've read, the Entourage is a little bit more upscale, although at a slight increase in cost. If you can still find one, I bet you can get a great deal on this great minivan.",4
1403,"I've had this car for three months, 2100 miles so far. My concerns are the following: the engine revs when I step on the brakes (but not always). The brakes seem flimsy and just don't feel right. The paint job seems to be cheap. I'm noticing orange peel surface and there are spots, especially near the windshield, where the clear coat is worn off or never existed. I don't seem to get the gas mileage that I should be. I drive about 85% city and usually get about 31 mpg. I don't think I'll keep this car long and I worry about how it will look and run after 2 years. Don't get the chrome shifter knob. After three months it comes loose all the time and no longer lines up properly.",1
1404,"For sure will get speeding tickets cause its way fun, surprised haven't been stopped. Yet. Should be the best selling car in America. Canoes and kayaks fit fine on roof rack. Lots of stuff in back. Back seat is better than previous years VWs. Did I say this is fun?",4
1405,"Ordered the car in early April 07. Was worth the wait! My car cost about 15,050 with shipping. I've only driven 500 miles, MPG = 38-41. Parked at an NHRA race in Madison Il. and must have had 100 people ask questions and give the thumbs up-even several Illinois State troopers. The car is what it is and I love it! The shifting is hard to get use to but with a little practice it is a blast. Steering is also tricky because of the short wheelbase",3
1406,"So far so good. Wish it had better gas mileage, but I knew what I would get before I bought it, just did not know how much gas prices would rise.",3
1407,"After to doing all the research on vehicles in this segment you will find out like I did that you get the most for your money with the jetta. The car outperforms others such as the civic and corolla not to mention the options you get as standard equipment such as a moonroof and heated seats in the SE model that I have.But what really got me was how well put together this car really is.Its super solid,there's no real body roll when banking into turns.The clutch is light as a feather so I know my 115 pound little girl wont have trouble with fatigue in those days in traffic not to mention the smooth seamless shifting the manual transmission gives you.And after she saw it's styling she wanted it",4
1408,"We've had 4 winter storms to date. Last storm dumped 10 inches. Drove home with no problems-slight slip in the intersections, but even our 97 Expedition slipped in that too. Very capable in the snow! Used 4WD lock to get in the driveway-works great! My husband loves mine so much, we just got him one yesterday-stripper for $17K-how can you beat that for the milage and 4WD? Even the vinyl seats don't feel cheap-looks like leather. Still has side impact airbags, ABS, electronic stablility control, tire pressure alarm light and outside temp guage. A lot of bang for the buck- plus it's a nice Marine blue-very sharp! Looking forward to better milage. Trading 96 RAV 4 that's only getting 20MPG.",3
1409,"This is our first Honda and we couldn't be more pleased. I am an engineer and appreciate what they have done to produce such a versatile vehicle. My wife loves the van and I have to say that I love it also. No problems so far. The ride is excellent and the handling is great. I have a high performance sports car so the comparison is valid. We went with the 08' because of the newer engine technology, options not included on the 07' model. and the new look. Pricing was higher, but we feel it was worth it. I just asked my wife if she had any other comments and she responded ""I love it"".",4
1410,"I have never owned a GM vehicle. I have been waiting for this one since its debut at the Detroit Auto Show. Almost bought an Acadia because they came out first and I was chomping at the bit. Am so glad I was patient. It was well worth it. Drives beautifully. Very quiet. Very smooth. Handling is quite responsive. Feels very solid and safe. Looks great. Interior is nice. Plenty of room in all three rows. Traded in a Chrysler Town & Country that I loved. No regrets. Only the third day of my ownership, but so far I am quite pleased. Looking for excuses to drive!",4
1411,"I have had my G35S for over a year now and I can honestly say that I still love this car. Great brakes, great performance, great style, great radio, just an all around great car!!! My only complaint is the gas mileage, it is not good at all. I know this car is a performance car, but I never expected 16 mpg or less for highway/local road travel.",3
1412,"Horrible on fuel and surprising lack of power. Probably due to the large tire size and it aggressive nature. The door locks automatically lock when you put the vehicle in drive but only the drivers door unlocks automatically after being placed in park. This is extremely annoying with children and retrieving items from other doors. All things considered, we do love this vehicle and its a joy to drive on a nice summer day w/ the top down. We would certainly buy it all over again as in our case as a second vehicle.",3
1413,"I had a 2001 Pontiac Grand Am and I hated it! I told myself that I would never buy another Pontiac. After I totalled my Grand Am, I found this car and I convinced myself to buy it because it was super cute! I totally love this car! It's fun to drive! I feel so safe driving it! I love the interior lights on the dash.",4
1414,"I love my GXP especially since nobody else has it yet. I'm always asked what's a GXP, they don't even realize it's a G6. Looks so much different than all the others. I love that!",4
1415,"I traded in my BMW 323i for this car and about the only regret that I have is that this car is a bit longer, other than that, what a car! It's also great that I got a great deal on it. You get so much for your money with this car. I got the Premium Package and the Nav. Package and think they're both great. I had debated buying the car without the Nav. package and then buying a portable device but I'm happy I went with the built-in as they tie in so many other things to it. Since I listen to music a lot I'm really happy with the music choices (iPod, Compact Disk, radio, or CDs). And this car has the power when you put your foot on the gas.",4
1416,"This car has exceeded my high expectations. Performance, styling, quality (inside and out) are incredible. This is an amazing car. The seats are comfortable, the ride is smooth yet sporty, and the peformance with the twin-turbo is unbelieveable. We've had the car for about a month and the whole family loves it.",4
1417,"It rides like a dream, handles very well, and has all the power, with a K&N air charger- power all the more! Bottom line, it's comfy, stylish, responsive, quick and only costs around 32K, as we all know, you can't get an Acura for that, as if I'd want one after this gem! If you pass this up, go back to Uranus or whatever other planet that is in the deep cold of overcharging for the same vehicle that is everywhere, just slightly ""Emblemed"". I love it!",4
1418,"i recently purchased my '07 yaris hatchback and i LOVE IT! it is extremely spacious on the inside and i love all of the available features, the armrest(very comfortable), the aux jack which is even better because it is accesible with i-pods, keyless entry, power windows, etc.. this car is a dream. Lots of pickup, this car really likes to go even though it only has 109 hp. The digital gauges are a fun new feature that i havent yet seen in a toyota(my family owns only toyotas).",4
1419,"Love it! The Versa was the best deal with options for the price. Gas mileage hard to beat. Rides smooth, even on bumpy roads. Lots of bells and whistles. Great interior room, lots of leg room in both front and back. Love the 6 CD player and iPod connection.",4
1420,"The new 2008 Saturn Vue was a complete surprise to me. My friend had suggested I add it to my lists of considerations... which were the Lexus RX 350, Envoy Denali, and the BMW X3...I wanted a small luxury type suv. I completed rejected the idea. My fiance and I happen to drive by the Saturn dealership and I saw it....I feel in love with the exterior, was amazed by the interior, and after driving it I had to have it! I got all the features and looks I wanted without the heavier price tag. I'm absolutely loving my new Saturn Vue XR and from the comments and looks I receive so are others.",4
1421,"Wow am I surprised. The interior of this car is more beautiful than anything I have seen or driven, including the various Acura's, BMW's, and MB's I've had and my friend's Cayenne. The power is smooth and the fit and finish are excellent. The only thing a bimmer or Audi has that this lacks is the suede/leather on the doors..this car has plastic. So what? The saddle leather is unbelievable. The price was amazing, too, with recent incentives (MSRP $46K with option, $33K out the door!)",3
1422,I just traded my 2005 Ram SLT1500 with 4.7 liter V8 for a 2007 Ram Big Horn Edition SLT1500 with 5.7 liter Hemi multi-displacement engine. I was looking for the higher tow rating and the lifetime warranty (however my 2005 had a nice extended Mopar 7/70 warranty on the powertrain). The 2007 is a wonderful truck. The Big Horn comes with 20 inch wheels that look super but may take a little away in the towing department. The Blue Tooth hook up is great as is the satellite radio. Both of those items are in demand and appreciated. The chassis is excellent for driving and pleasing to tow with. Nothing beats the look of a big Ram. I got a great deal too as the 2008's (with less rated HP) were here!,3
1423,"I'm just the opposite of the mid-life crisis guy. Traded my 2008 red Corvette for what has to be the best lux/sports auto available. This car is so so smooth & sleek with a superb build quality both inside and out. Strangers are complementing my new ride at every stop or so it seems. This is our third Benz (wife on her second one, my first) and by far the best vehicle. I tested Jag's XF, BMW's 535 (powerful), and the Lexus offerings. I fell in love with the E350. Sienna Black with Black/Beige leather and designo Burl Walnut trim.",3
1424,"Bottom Line- Ultimate compromise between sport and luxury. Very quick, smooth, glides over nicks and crannies in the road. I spend plenty of time on the road- love the silent ride! On the contrary, when the pedal hits the mat, the engine makes an extremely defined roar. Comfortable as hell up front, not so in the back. If I was at the track every day, 335i would be my choice. If I needed a car that would accommodate my daily driving with comfort and performance- no brainer- IS350. Excellent Audio.",3
1425,"Only have had the car for 3 weeks (500 miles). It's fun to drive, looks great, and is roomy inside. Looks like a car that costs $1,000's more than it does. We were going to buy an '08 Malibu LTZ but decided on the Wolfsburg instead. (More standard features and cheaper price.)",3
1426,"I traded in my 2006 GMC Sierra 1500 Crew Cab b/c my family needed a more comfortable ride for long trips. We looked at the Avalanche but really no difference from the Sierra with cabin space and comfort. The Denali rides like a dream. My truck had the old 5.3L V8 and felt just a little under- powered. The Denali with the new 6.2L V8 has plenty of power from towing my boat to accelerating for passing on the interstate (or even accelerating on the interstate while pulling the boat!!) Average gas mileage for my driving style is the same as the Sierra but definitely sucks more gas in town. Very comfortable, quiet ride. I do miss having a ""truck"" but that's what utility trailers are for.",3
1427,"I love my Honda Civic Hybrid. Its fun to drive and not nearly as slow feeling as some reviewers have said. The CVT is hard to get used to...but give the car such a smooth feel and tends to make me drive faster. The interior color choices could be much better, but the finish is great. My gas mileage has been amazing. I actually traded in my 2006 Honda Accord V-6 for this car and do not regret it one bit!!! Fun car and great gas mileage.",3
1428,"Last vehicle I had was a 1991 Mazda Navajo. What a difference 16 years makes. Did 4 months of research (Edmunds, Cars.com, Vehix, CR) all rated the car well despite new design. Choice between Pilot & Highlander. Pilot was a little too utilitarian and mpg ratings fr: blogs dissuaded me. I made the right choice. Have only had it a month and filled it twice, but highway: got 25 mpg, mixed, got 20.5 mpg despite 6 cylinder, limited, AWD, tow package, backup navi & bluetooth. All user friendly. Highly recommend this vehicle.",4
1429,"What a nice vehicle. Powerful comfortable. Just a treat to drive until you pass a gas station. I thought with the 6 speed transmission it would get halfway descent gas mileage. About 16 in the city, 27 or so on the road. (I'm sure I can do better on the highway). My 96 Grand Caravan did better in City driving. Overall this is a very nice car. I really like it!",3
1430,Just bought it a couple of weeks ago. And so far it is a really nice ride. We traded in our Civic for it. One thing I did notice and always gave low marks to is cabin noise in a Honda. This one has really low cabin noise and is peppy to boot. The overall design is appealing to the eye and that is why we chose it over the large Pilot.,3
1431,"After some long thought I chose the Armada over a Tahoe. After owning a week I wonder why I ever cosidered a Tahoe. Fully loaded this baby comes with options that would have cost $5000 more than a Tahoe. Everything fits perfect, rides better than our Suburban, has more power. My only problem is why I did not buy one sooner.",4
1432,Great car to drive. I got the Levinson premium sound system and it sounds great. All the gadgets on this car take a little time to get accustomed. This car has plenty of power. I also have a 2004 Volvo turbo after driving the RX when I got into the Volvo I thought I had the hand brake on.,3
1433,"I bought this horrible minivan and have been dissatisfied since.,.Front end vibrates entire car..dealer had car for 1/2 the month and factory rep said ""he knows the vibration that I am experiencing""...AND...I m now filing with BBB as Hyundai warranty requests but for the extra $$$ I would have spent--Would have been well worth it to SAVE me this aggrevation...I took another Entourage off the lot & test drove..The vibration existed in the new one toooo..Especially at 75-80 the steering wheel was shaking uncontrollably...Must be an engineering defect or my car was built on a Day before or after a Holiday.",0
1434,"Had the dreaded engine issue that is common for these twin turbos but as long as I buy Chevron gas, it's no problem! Love the features and the performance capability. The fact that I won't pay for the first 4 yrs of service is a bonus. If you're looking to buy a new one, check into the European Delivery pkg so you can try it out on the Autobahn! U won't be disappointed.",3
1435,"This car is just plain fun! Ergonomic design is close to perfect. Handling is tight and acceleration is surprisingly good. This car was purchased for my wife, but I am considering one for myself.",3
1436,"Drove a pick-up for the past 20 years. Due to high gas prices had to find something a little more gas friendly. Stumbled upon the Fit at my local dealer and thought I would give it a try. WOW, I was not disappointed and bought it the next day. Mixed driving getting 36-39 mpg. Drove 350 miles on 9.1 gals. The rear fold down seats create lots of room. Have to fold down the smaller back seat for golf clubs. Handles great!!! Honda has done it again.",3
1437,Great balance between speed/sports car and luxury. Wicked fast when you want it. Super soft for cruising (highway driving is great - not like a big sedan but much smoother than similar speed sports cars). Four adults OK but a little tight. Great choice for sports car with the occational need for four adults.,3
1438,"When you purchase this car you must have the understanding that this is a basic roadster. It doesn't pretend to be something else. It's raw, tiny, a little unrefined in some areas but definity fun. It will be hard to come from a complete car such as an Accord or an SUV to go to Miata because somethings just doesn't work right in the Miata. The cupholders in the center are completely useless because they intrude into the elbow space while shifting gears. The grade of plastics is from the 70's and that's not a good thing. And the sound the comes from opening and closing the truck is truly horrible.",2
1439,"I went to Germany to visit some relatives and they had a Yaris. I fell in love with it over there. When it came out over here I just had to have one. I love that it is roomy, and easy to handle. You can get in just about any parking space. It is very fuel efficient and good looking. People even stop and look.",4
1440,"We've had a 2005 Hyundai Elantra that gave us no issues at all, so we looked at the Tucson, but liked the more modern look and feel of the Kia Sportage. Surprised at the tight fit and finish, and the nice interior does not really feel or look cheap. Quiet cabin, great ride and beautiful paint and quality. Lots of room and a very well put together vehicle. Performance is actually OK in the 4-Cyl...I mean this isn't a racer but not what you buy these for anyway. It's more than adequate for ramps and merging and drives great on the highway.",3
1441,"Solid on road handling, easy to learn interior features(like the Navigation sys),lots of room for 8, safety and reliability. Although 16 MPG for city, very efficient on long distant driving. The drive is so comfortable...good job Honda!",4
1442,"I would definitely recommend this car. It's sporty, got some pep, looks nice because of the standard body kit, and the MPG is awesome. Plus it's got the Honda rep behind it. Honda is already affordable overall, but this is the value vehicle for Honda at this time. I am 48 years old and love it. But I would definitely recommend it for a kid going to college and going the normal runarounds.",4
1443,"I've owned this car for just under a month now, and am totally blown away by how much fun it is to drive. I have a Lexus ES 300, and bought this car for my wife. But I find myself arguing with her over who gets to drive this on the weekend. Great looking exterior, good looking interior, excellent functional features. I got the GT AWD with the technology package - just love the way the nav screen moves to reveal the CD player. For a family of 2 who needs more space but doesn't want to go for a large SUV, this is perfect. The way the turbocharger kicks in to give the car a boost, is phenomenal. Gripes include an over sensitive light sensor that dims the screen, no memory seats.",4
1444,"Nice car, Bang for the buck. I love it and won't trade it in for anything. I love the ride except for creaking noise of the plastics when I drive at low speeds. Road noise is pretty high.",4
1445,"I have been buying Lexus cars for the last 15 years and they have always provided luxury, comfort, reliability and safety. Now they have all the above plus speed and fun. The IS-F provides great acceleration, agility and high speed with great control and safety. The top speed is over 185, but limited to 168 by a governor. The 0-60 time was 4.2 seconds but Lexus advertises 4.6 sec. Overall this is a great sports car that also feels good just with every day driving.",3
1446,"This is my favorite purchase ever! I was looking for something smaller and a little sportier and I couldn't be happier. It has just enough cargo room and I'm surprised at what I've been able to fit in the trunk when I put the back seats down. The doors are nice and long which makes it easy for people to get into the back seat. I have to say that I'm really happy with the amount of interior storage spaces and cup holders, my friends and I use my car to go everywhere and we're always comfortable and we have a lot of fun. The only thing I miss about my previous car is the automatic headlights. When I first bought this car, I kept forgetting to turn the headlights on and off.",4
1447,"If you are interested in an 08 Acadia do yourself a favor and RUN! All the problems with the first year 07's just continued with the 08's. I was back to the dealership every month the first year of ownership with problem after problem. The biggest problems being 10mpg fuel economy as well as multiple water leaks that could not be fixed. please be aware that if you decide to purchase and have problems, the only thing you will get out of GM customer service is a free oil change. Please learn from my mistake!",0
1448,"I test drove a lot of midsize suv's before deciding on the endeavor. I had a 2004 Tahoe z71 and traded it because I wanted better gas mileage and a better warranty. This vehicle is so nice to drive, feels stable, great gas mileage, my kids and all their gear fits comfortably in this car. And it can tow our four wheelers without a problem. The sound system is awesome with the subwoofer. By far better than the others for the price. We got the dvd system and the kids love it when we are on road trips. Great investment.",3
1449,"I purchased my CR-V in a snowstorm, picked it up in another snowstorm and have driven it through 4 snowstorms since. I am 150% pleased with purchase. I looked at the RAV-4, as well, but didnt like the handling and tire on the back of the Rav4. MPG is about 22.5 right now with mixed bumper to bumper city driving and highway driving in Chicago. Given that the AWD has been used frequently and the engine still isnt broken in, I expect this figure to go up. All total I have about 4-500 mi on it. Performance has been great for a 4cy, though it would be nice for more hp or a 6cy option. I had a 05 Accord 6cy prior to this, and I do miss the power, but I still love my CR-V.",3
1450,"This car replaced a 2001 Nissan Maxima. We got the manual with turbo and VDC. It is such a fun car to drive! It handles great and when you kick in the turbo you pass cars so quickly the drivers mouths are open. Could that be a Subaru wagon? I like the firm ride and tight handling. If you don't like really ""driving"" your car, buy a Honda Accord.",3
1451,"This car is an absolute blast to drive. Who ever said American car companies don't build cars people want? I will line up any Toyota, Honda, Nissan, etc. against this baby. For the price it can't be beat. First off the torque is unbelievable. HP is immediately available. No need to wind this baby up. You won't want to play the excellent 500 watt Shaker stereo radio as the exhaust note is the best sound you will ever hear. I test drove 20 different cars but when I got in this one I knew I was going to have to purchase it. Very easy to have fun driving around town and you will get 17-24 mpg on 87 octane. Fill the tank with 91 octane and hold onto your seat.",4
1452,This vehicle has set new standards for me. I am a Suburban driver so I am new to the GMC family. This truck is really nice to drive so comfortable when on a long trip or in town. The Bose radio system has unbelievable sound. My Denali has every option you can get and they all have been great. The only thing is with the price of gas today the mileage could be better. But if I would have wanted 30 mpg I would have gotten a Honda or a small car. I just got 18.2 mpg on trip with the air conditioning on. Don?t be afraid of gas mileage with this truck. The performance with the 380 hp engine has plenty of power for you.,3
1453,"Awesome car. I've owned 1998 and 2002 E320 4Matics and this car blows them away. I have the sport model. The ride is incredibly smooth, Nav is good as is the radio. If price is a consideration ask the dealer for an ""RDR"" car.",4
1454,"The only bad things I have seen that people say about the Lexus GS 350 has to do with the inabililty to use the GPS and Bluetooth systems while driving. Actually, you can use them while driving if you utilize all the options the GS 350 offers you. You only have limited use of the touch screen while driving, but that is what the voice command is for. You can use both the GPS and the Bluetooth to their full advantages if you understand how to use the voice command. You can enter phone numbers and addresses via voice command while driving. Much easier and safer than pushing buttons while driving. Always read directions for your toys before saying they don't work.",3
1455,"I test drove many vehicles before I settled on the Edge. You get a lot for the money.I had three requirements, comfort, quiet and hauling capabilities. It fulfills all three. The gas mileage is better than stated. I absolutely love the ride.",3
1456,"I've researched a lot of cars and found this to be the best bang for my buck. It is a true sports car, yet a gentleman's car as well. Highway driving is very comfortable. It handles extremely well in autoCross races also, easily beating cars such as the Porche Boxter. My only regret is not buying sooner.",4
1457,"I was very impressed with Hyundai when I took the Entourage on a test drive. I was shopping for a Honda mini van, and saw a Entourage. I drove a Honda Odyssey, and then drove the Entourage. The Odyssey did handle a little better, but it lacked power that the Entourage had. The main thing that sold me on the Hyundai was the price, and the awesome warranty that the car came with. I mean come on 5 year 60,000 Bumper to Bumper, and 10 year 100,000 miles powertrain, how can you pass that up. The Honda did not offer that. You had to pay thousands for that extended warranty on the honda. The MPG could be a little better, but that may be my habut related problem. I highly recommend it.",4
1458,"Very reliable, great ride and great for what I use it for. Best car in its class for a practical life. Easy to clean after the dogs have a dirty day in the park. Easy to get my mountain bikes in and out of. Outstanding for trips to Home Depot or Costco! Also, I am 6 ft 3in and this vehicle fits me better then much larger SUV's!",3
1459,"Love the car. But difficult to get out of it. Doors seem a bit small. GPS advanced, difficult to learn. Dealer should specifically have someone to spend 30 to 45 minutes with you to review. Would make life easier first few days. Overall very happy and doing better on gas after 350 miles than I expected",3
1460,"I owned a 2005 Honda Hybrid and drove it for 35,000 miles and loved the car. I could get 50 MPG if I was really careful and did not use the A/C. My overall MPG was about 4 5MPG. My son now owns the car and I shipped it out to him from Florida to California. He is getting 38 to 42 MPG. I purchased a new 08 Honda and we are getting 50 MPG using the A/C. The new car is much improved over the 05 Honda in every way. Honda has managed to make a great little car even better. I even love the two tiered dashboard. I only have one minor complaint. I wish Honda would reposition the hand brake.",3
1461,"I've had this vehicle now for about 9 months and completely love it. Mine has most of the extra bells and whistles, and I have been totally spoiled by the features - even the ones I thought I'd never use (keyless entry/start, lane assist, back up camera). With the 21 inch wheels this thing corners and handles more like a sports car than a SUV. But the beefy curb weight (while providing for a sense of security and impervious-ness-ity) definitely makes for less than thrilling accelerations. I expected this though when I bought it, so no surprises there. A few minor issues with squealing brakes and the like have been promptly handled by Audi care and all-in-all I am very happy with my Q7.",3
1462,Best-in-class handling and ride. True quality everywhere you look and touch.,4
1463,"So far at 7000 miles, the car has been flawless. Explosive acceleration, delightful torque at any speed. The car is a red Z51 convertible 6 speed manual. This car has a dual personality. If you want to just commute normally, it's relatively quiet, smooth and docile. If you drop the hammer, it turns into an animal, loud and brash. Even frightening if you are not expecting it. Despite stiffer Z51 option, ride is firm, but not harsh, I was impressed also with the stiffness of the structure despite being a convertible. So far no rattles and a door squeak went away as weather warmed up.",4
1464,This vehicle drives like a dream SUV. I am very impressed with the interior and exterior components along with the overall smooth ride and drive.,4
1465,"Got my car in June. I had a VW Beetle before so I'm used to a small car but Coop seems to be getting smaller everytime I get in. Leatherette seats make you sweat & the doors won't stay open. The cup holders are not usable, except the one in the back & the arm rest is in the way of that one. It drives fun when you go fast but in the city with stop & go traffic, it jumps a lot. Not sure if that's normal, but the dealership assures me that it is. It's been in the shop 2x since I've gotten it, the first time b/c my check engine light came on & I asked them to check the ""jumpyness"". They reset the computer & replaced recalled parts but then it became really jumpy & was smoking. Got it back today.",2
1466,"3 months and 8,000 miles. I really love the car. Great sporty fun on the back roads; very long-legged and comfortable on the freeway. Originally looked at the manual, but read up on the CVT, tested it, and I love it: the powerful and smooth acceleration is hard to describe. Manual-mode is great fun too. A real head-turner. You don't see many coupes on the road, and I've had LOTS of compliments on it (mine's black). For the money, I don't know how you can beat the power, handling, and styling. For me this car is a good mix: a sporty ""driver's car"", but still comfortable and practical for the daily commute (especially the front-wheel drive for winter).",4
1467,I have owned many cars including three BMW's and this car is more comfortable and drives as well or better than the 525 BMW.,3
1468,"True Mustang fans can tell anyone, hey if your not a mustang fan keep your comments to yourself. Since I purchased my Shelby most people always ask ""is it fast""? My first response is to say no, a 1976 Pinto could trash this junker. So I give in and say ya 500 hp can make anyone grin. People always want to compare cars. If you like Vettes buy a Vette, if you like Vipers buy a vVper, etc. All cars are different in shape size hp, torque, etc. That's why living in America is so rewarding. An average Joe like me can build his credit up and buy what ever he wants with in reason. Point to my story, Shelby Gt 500 holds true for being first once again, so here comes Dodge and Chevy trying to out do Ford.",3
1469,"Im 63 so I wanted a cheap, basic, mileage car. I guess in my generation the basics are the basics. I don't need, cruise control, auto windows and all the rest. I did get air, stereo, power steering , five speed (dont need automatic). I also got gas mileage, that will come and go, though. I have gotten as low as 30.5 and as high as 39, it seems it's always this way, but this is honest mileage. Sticker mileage, brag mileage, and honest mileage. But the car is cute, rides good, mileage O.K. but it's NOT a turnpike cruiser with the goodies. I love it, 9.5 on a scale of 10. But over 40mph keep an eye on the speedo.",4
1470,"I purchased a Caliber RT AWD 5 months ago and I really enjoy this mid car. It rides great, AWD and ESP are awesome, it's perfect for Quebec winter conditions. The Caliber is fun to drive, specially in snow.",4
1471,"This is the best car out there for the money. I shopped many cars when buying this one and took a good three months before deciding after test drives and reading reviews. This car beats the Corolla, Civic, and Sentra hands down for the money. You can get many more standard features in it than in a Honda Civic EX. With this car you save at least $5,000-$7,000 with the same features. I drive it 100% in the city and it gets just 19-22 mpg as advertised. You can get up to 33-35 mpg at 70 mph on the freeways. Overall I am a very satisfied Toyota customer. Don't go by the negative reviews out there, some people don't understand cars at all. Period.",4
1472,"Traded in my fully loaded 2002 BMW X5 for a 2008 E350W. Should not compare apples to oranges. First Impression : After few weeks of driving the E Class, corner of my heart the BMW wins. As the saying goes, when you don't have it anymore is you will miss it even more.",2
1473,"This truck is fun to drive and is a real work horse. Gets better gas mileage in town than my previous GM truck that had a smaller V8. Recently towed a 32' travel trailer 500 miles and it was an effortless tow for the 5.7 V8. So far, truck has been trouble free. I love the extra space behind the front seats. Added a rubber mat in that area to keep things from sliding around. The truck is easy to get around in the woods while hunting. In my experience short wheelbase trucks are much more fun to drive and have fewer vibrations and wheel balancing problems than extended cab models. I love driving this truck.",3
1474,"When loaded with leather, heated seats, retractable sun roof and a fine sound system this vehicle is nearly as good as the Hyundai Acera. The car cruises on the highway extremely well. It does not have the pep I would like but it does the job especially when fueled with E-85. This flex fuel vehicle gets a big lift from the higher octaine gasoline that helps solve the sluggish pickup problem. I found the vehicle not as comfy as my Cadillac Deville but it was nearly as nice. The price of this vehicle is right. The 28k I saved made me feel a heck of alot better in giving up my Cadillac for the 31 mpg I now get on the freeway. Good value, good on gas and nice looking to boot.",3
1475,"I love this car!!! I almost chose the SPEC-V, but my girlfriend does not know how to drive standard, so that's that. Anyway, the brakes stop on a dime, the suspension is amazing, the CVT pulls hard. The fuel economy is not as good as I thought, but I do push the car somewhat. The stereo is great, but wished it played MP3s; I am 6'3 and pretty big, and it fits me like a cadillac would. I bought an extended warranty only because CVT is a new technology, and did not want to get stuck with a $4000 bill if the tranny fails. The a/c is strong; I have nothing but good to write about this car, it is truly the best of all worlds. Comfortable, fast, reliable, solid, and everything is just excellent.",4
1476,"I have always been a truck owner and have never been a fan of foreign made trucks. With gas prices on the rise and every year fewer and fewer trips to Home Depot for home and yard repair, I started looking at something more economic. I did all of my homework because I needed a crew cab for my family. I went with the Honda because it offered more for my money. It was about 5000 cheaper than the Toyota, it has a high resale value, better gas economy, cheaper insurance, and was more comfortable. I also would note that I do not haul trailers, boats, etc... for the average Joe this is a vehicle that is family friendly, rides like a car, and looks like a truck!!!",3
1477,"Purchased this car in April and has 3k miles now. With the sport package you get the look of the M5 without the manumatic transmission. Build quality is what is to be expected from BMW. Outstanding engine response, especially in sport mode, great handling and extremely comfortable. The sport suspension rides harder than any dedicated sports car I have driven, but definitely ups the handling from the base suspension. Great car. BMW has hit another homerun with this car.",4
1478,"Unable to use back seat due to poor design of Freedom Hard top and inability of passenger seat to fold forward far enough for easy access even for small dog. In my opinion, it would be almost impossible to get any passengers out in case of a crash.",1
1479,"I recently purchased a new RX 350. I have been very happy so far! I go through about 35k miles a year, so comfort and quality are my biggest concerns and this vehicle meets these with no problems at all. I trade out about every year and this is by-far the most enjoyable midsize SUV that I have owned. And I have driven everything from Toyota to BMW to Honda. There are a few weird things could be changed but not every vehicle is perfect. Great choice for a comfortable and stylish ride and perfect for sales!",3
1480,"The title is what I hear from all of my friends and the ""anti-Prius"" crowd when they first sit in my car. With so many suggested improvements, why did I give it such a high mark? Mainly because the cons mean a lot less to me than the pros. Last year, I was set on buying a hybrid, so when comparing other models, the Prius was a hands down winner. The rear trunk/back seat design is much more superior than the hybrid honda civic. I also feel it is superior to the Toyota Camry Hybrid. If the Prius is too expensive, I have a friend who bought a Honda Fit and loves it. Overall, the Prius is a great car with a great design, and I am happy to see more and more of them in the Boston area!",3
1481,"I love this little car! It has as much room as my 96 Camry did. I can fit my 10 speed bike in the back with the seat down. It was a good buy pricewise too. I am planning to put 300,000 plus miles on it.",4
1482,"Have learned to trust automobile ratings by Consumer Reports, especially when confirmed by owner's evaluations at Edmunds. The Sonata has earned those high ratings. Solid performance, with surprising good acceleration, both around town and on the highway, for a four cylinder engine. Anti-lock breaks are firm and secure. Turning and cornering are comfortable. Seating has prominent lower back support. Two minor quibbles, each with solution. Passenger seat belt in retracted position bangs around against center post when windows rolled down. Lever on passenger seat can be used to clip seat belt away from post. Second, side of car easily gets muddy on wet streets, solved by mud flaps.",3
1483,The six speed manual performes smoothly. Torque is impressive in all gears. Convertible top operates like magic. Rear seating is very limited. Makes my daily commute to work a pleasure. The lines of the car are distinctive and will get you second looks. Little torque steering from front wheel drive.,3
1484,This car is perfect. The EPA says 36 but I am averaging closer to 43. I try and keep my tank above the half way mark at all times. It really is a great car!,4
1485,"Stoll love this care after dring for 9 months and 14m miles. Great design, inside and out. Technology is first class. Love the quiet ride. I traded a BMW SUV that I loved, and now love the Buick more. This is first American car I've acquired personally in almost 40 years, and its quality holds up well against Mercedes, BMWs, Jaguars I've had.",3
1486,"I've owned 4 Hondas of which 2 were CR-v (07 and 08). Compared to the Xterra they didn't stand a chance. The Xterra is solidly built and they thought of everything. Also you get so many features compared to the Hondas and the Xterra is customizable. I really love mine. I've had it for 3 days so far, but I am really enjoying the ride. It's high up, visibility is great, and it's built so solid. No annoying rattles, etc. The plastic interior is very high quality and I feel that it's laid out perfect. Everything is in the right place. Power everything, mirrors, doors, windows. and it came with high quality mats even! I hope Nissan keeps up with not sacrificing quality.",3
1487,"Having have many performance German vehicles in the past (BMW E46 M3 was my last), there is no substitute for displacement. The torque on takeoff always puts a smile on my face. I love the NPP exhaust which I recommend to anyone as a must have. This car is a tremendous deal for the price that will spank many cars costing 2-3 times more. Also, to increase the HP to over 500 is relatively cheap compared to German or Italian cars.",3
1488,"I bought my Scion after 2 test drives and I liked everything about it, the look, features, performance, price etc. However I was disappointed when I began hearing squeaking near the radio and rattling all over the place. After just 7 months I had a problem with a fuse. When I turned on my headlights all of my interior lights would turn off, my car was pitch black at night. Another big disappointment was the weak AC. It blows mildly cool air on the coldest setting. This car has heavy doors and paint that chips/scratches easily. I have to say that aside from all the imperfections the car is pretty decent on gas mileage and the sunroof is a good feature. I guess you get what you pay for.",2
1489,"I have about 3k miles on my Acadia and am very happy with it. I usually get about 21-22 mpg on a tank of gas, not too bad for new and I notice the faster I go, the better the mileage. The tranny seems abit sluggish through its changes especially around 45 mph, but even that is improving as I use it. The ride is great!",3
1490,"This Jeep has been a headache since I got it. My Jeep Patriot came to me from the factory with a faulty crank and sensor, so, every morning I get to hold my breath as I listen to the thing crank for 10-15 seconds before finally turning over. I think to myself, is this the day it is not going to start, every morning! It will be going to see a certified Chrysler dealer for the third time to fix this issue! wish me luck! On top of that, there is something wrong with the gas gauge and i ran out of gas on the highway because I got about 5 miles after the fuel light went on. One headache after the next with this Jeep Patriot and I had such high hopes. buyers beware!",1
1491,"I went searching for the safest vehicle I could find. This was pretty much it. It also happens to be about the quietest, smoothest ride I found. If there's a downside, it's that it's so quiet driving along at freeway speed, it's easy to let your mind wander. Doesn't hit 20 mpg though, and with premium fuel, expect 50-60 dollar fillups. But that's a small price to pay for one of the best vehicles on the road.",4
1492,"Just purchased the 08 ES 350. Have driven it about 3 weeks and put over 1400 miles on it. Great car. Very quiet and comfortable. I also own an Acura TL which I love, but there is no comparison to the comfortable ride in the ES. Great car. I read all the reviews for the 07 and decided to wait for the 08s before I bought. I have not experienced any of the problem with down shifting reported in the 07s. Be careful with the remote in your pockets against other keys. It could accidentaly let the windows down.",4
1493,"I recommend the Ford Edge, it is fun to drive, handles excellent with good acceleration. When I first got it I had to train myself to stop driving so fast. It is also the perfect height, low enough to handle well but high enough to feel like you are sitting in a chair instead of with your legs out in front of you like you are on the floor. Before this I had a 6 cyl Subaru Outback 04, before that a V-6 Lexus ES300 98. Both of these handled very well but did a number on my back and I couldn't see anything sitting so low to the ground. I'm getting around 20 mpg which I feel is good for a 3.5L 265hp. Rides smooth too!",3
1494,"We bought this vehicle for my wife, she was looking for a spacious crossover to upgrade from her VW Passat for our 2 active boys. We looked at the Ford Edge, Nissan Murano, and Mazda CX-7. The Edge was just boring to drive, the Murano was our second fav pick, but too pricey and significantly smaller. We were most surprised though about the difference between the CX-7 & the 9. The fit and finish of the 9 seemed significantly better than the 7. Both are fun to drive, the 7 has serious zoom-zoom, but for a bigger vehicle, the 9 does as well. For overall look and utility, the 9 was the hands down winner for us.",4
1495,"The 2008 Kia Rondo is a pleasant surprise. We considered a Matrix or Vibe but the Rondo won the day. Its clearly a great value. The quality of the Rondo is impressive. Kia has grown up here and can compete with the big boys. Good work Kia! The utility, roominess and ride of the Rondo is impressive. Seven seats in this size of car is amazing. The car does what it's supposed to, has all kinds of bells and whistles (the heated seats are nice) and the price can't be beat. Great for small families who don't like big 'mini' vans. The 4cyl engine and transmission are more than adequate. I'm looking forward to seeing how the quality of this vehicle holds up over time.",3
1496,"I really love my Yaris. I had to replace 97 Chavlier and went looking for a truck and bought a 2 door, (3 if you count the hatch), small car. I like the way you can get into the car without feeling you about to sit in a well. I'm only 5 even and that was one selling point is that I could get in and out without fighting gravity. The dealer thought I was crazy when I said that the Yaris had a small ""growl"" like a Mustang I test droved. I didn't realize till two days later that I had it in Drive 3. Duh.",3
1497,"This is my second Equinox. I previously leased a 2006 AWD LT. I recently bought the 2008 because of great dealer incentives. This one has much better handling, fewer blind spots, and a excellent, comfortable ride. I like the standard OnStar, which I used to have in my leased Trailblazers (3 of them). The gas mileage is excellent (25-26mpg hwy) even though I'm still in the process of breaking it in. I get a lot of compliments on it and it looks very sharp in black. I also got the remote start and it is awesome (cheap add-on, too). I looked a lot of vehicles and am so glad I bought this one.",3
1498,"I have owned Jags, Mercs, BMW, and Cadillacs and they all have their outstanding features. The regal look of the Jag, the comfort of the Merc and the Cadi's smooth ride. The Audi L W12 (my first) took the best features of luxury automobiles in its class and built a car that has lived up to my expectations. Yes the car has a six figure price tag fully loaded; however the car delivers on all its promises and gives the driver a senseof royalty without being to flashy. Would it be fair to say that I am an Audi man for life? YES!!",4
1499,"This is my second new Civic in two months! After driving my first new 2007 for 3 weeks, a drunk hit me on the driver's side. The side air bags went off perfectly and I walked away from my totaled car. I guess this speaks to the car's safety. Since I purchased an end of 2007 Civic and I liked the car, I went ahead and purchased a 2008-same exact model/color. The new 2008 differs from the 2007 with the addition of a handy tire pressure monitor (which went off a couple of days) and the absence of a key entrance for the for the trunk. Very fun to drive. Excellent handling and braking. Good acceleration. Mileage so far has been 31 (city/hwy).",3
1500,"This car is surprisingly quick for a base engine with automatic. The six speed trans is very smooth and is programmed perfectly. Handling is excellent and performance in snow is very good. The interior is very good, but I'm not sure I like the placement of the cruise control lever. Love the heated seats and chilled glove box. Sunroof is very well designed with little wind noise even at highway speeds. So far there have been no problems with any part of the car.",3
1501,"I traded in a 2005 Acura TL for the Lexus. I feel like I've from cream to half&half. Don't get me wrong, this is a very good car, and it was the AWD at a reasonable cost that sold me. The interior is beautifully well crafted, but not as ergonomically friendly as the Acura. You feel more road irregularities, but if were expecting not to you bought the wrong car. My biggist gripe (and I hate to keep comparing the TL) is the Manual/Sport shift. Nowhere near as seamless as the Acura. Even worse is when you move your shifter over into that mode, the default gear is 4th - rather than the gear you were in. Pretty abrupt if your in 6th, which this car has you in most of the time.",2
1502,"I've owned my '08 Altima for almost 5 months now and am extremely pleased. There have been absolutely no glitches. MPG range from 32-36, with 50/50 city highway driving. I notice my wife has some difficulty keeping it in EV mode as often as I do. It does take a little practice and experience anticipating hills, stops, etc. But the thing can really move on command! Great having a car that gets over 600 miles on a tank. I've gotten many positive comments about its sleek styling. Nothing negative to offer.",4
1503,"Drove 2290 miles and put in 91.3 gallons of gas until my last fillup so I am getting 25.1 MPG with about 50% highway and 50% city commute. On the open flat highway driving at 60 mph I got up to 33mpg. This small SUV is quiet, comfortable and has many comfort items like a good stereo, good AC and well positioned controls. This car is loaded with electronic sensors and automated functions, alarms and messages so long term reliability is questionable. Overall quality of finish is excellent. Road handling is very good and does not sway on curves. Engine is not very powerfull during acceleration but gets good mileage. I am curious about the AWD traction on snow and ice in the winter.",3
1504,"Still new, I am really enjoying this car. It feels more expensive than it is. We were looking to stay small and cheap so we looked at Accent, Yaris, Rio etc. and then found out this car was not much more in price but much better for the money.",3
1505,"We own or have owned 2 competing vehicles this year. Picked the Edge based on payment & 98% on looks. My 07' Hyundai Santa Fe & 08' Hyundai Veracruz are leagues above the Edge in build quality, refinement & pamper level. Edge is quite quick, handles nice. Lots of looks, comments from other drivers. But if one doesn't care so much about looks, the Santa Fe or Veracruz are simply night & day in quietness, refinement, smoothness & quality. A difference likened between Toyota Rav4 VS BMW X5 V8. The Edge is nice to drive & acceptable. The Hyundai's are simply impressive every time you drive them. I'd have to say they are 3 - 5 tiers above the Edge.",3
1506,I replaced a '90 manual Probe seeking an economical and reliable ride. Considering the smaller engine 1.8L vs 2.2L the highway performance is surprisingly good. The Probe had an edge in acceleration during passing but the Corolla is noticeable quieter at 75mph. Tire noise is about the same. Corolla shifting is clearly smoother. Calculated fuel economy averages 33 mpg. On Boston to NYC trips I've gotten 40. Trunk space is surprisingly roomy. A key factor was that it carry all my amateur astronomy stuff. The little storage areas including the armrest storage are quite convenient keeping the interior neat. Radio reception is excellent. CD/radio sound is good,3
1507,"Realizing of course that no vehicle is perfect, I love this vehicle. Previously drove a Mercury Mountaineer and hated it. It drove like a truck and felt very cold. The CX-9 GT is so refined and fun to drive. Smooth, quiet ride, plenty of room, and a very nice feel.",3
1508,"Definitely not worth 33,000 dollars. No leg room for back seats. No auto turn on/off of headlights. Rough riding. Opening the driver door after a drive will not open the back door. You have to use either the remote or the door button to open the back doors. Bad fuel economy. Wish there was atleast a beep sound when you back up to walls or curb (expect that for cars over 30000). Tom",1
1509,"I have had my tC since October, I did not even know that Scion even made this model. I was giving up on the new car search and I cam arcoss the tC. I love my car. Great speed, great cornering and nice look. The price was also wonderful. Thanks",3
1510,"We looked at Acadia, RDX, FX35, Rav4, and others. The fully loaded CX-7 was cheapest of the lot, and fuel economy not appreciably lower. Handles as well as my mother's fully loaded RX-350 for 20k less. Leather seats and interior fit and finish and exterior styling are all exceptionally good. A real wow factor on the nav system ergonomics and fold down. Bose stereo is more than adequate. Sunroof a bit small and don't like the ""mousehair"" ceiling material but they had to cut something I suppose. Was concerned about turbo 4 cyl reliability in out years and we drive cars forever so bought the 10 year extended factory warranty. A great car & joy to drive.",3
1511,"All I can say is wow. What a great CUV, but why doesn't Ford market it more? Although at first I was a bit bummed when the wife said she would rather have the Taurus X than the AWD Limited Edge we both really loved, I am happy to say that I am very glad I bought her a Taurus X. So far, this is one fine CUV. The day after we got it we took it up north with 3 other people and stuff for the 5 of us and still had plenty of room. The only thing I regret not getting is the DVD Nav.system. So far avg 18.5 city and 24hwy MPG. Very pleased considering it has less that 1k miles on it",3
1512,If you love the feel of the road then you will love this series of Lexus because due to the stiff suspension you will feel every bump in the road. If you are broad in the beam get a different car. When I drove the car I had to shift my position numerous times to feel comfortable - the seat is not wide enough for a larger than average person. There is a wind noise on both sides of the windshield that should never be heard from a car in this price range - and owners of the same style Camry have reported the same noise as well but Toyota/Lexus report that this is normal. If you are long waisted (short legged) get a different car - it is impossible to adjust the height for comfort.,3
1513,"We bought this car to replace a Honda Accord which we were sorry to see go but needed AWD. To cut a long story short we tried a number of cars we tried a number of 'smaller' crossovers including a CX-7, and then my wife sat in a CX-9 they had on the lot. 1 hour later we owned it. It was just head and shoulders over anything else we had looked at in terms of quality, performance and out and out 'coolness'. Interior is stunning, well thought out and comfortable. Leg room is generous as is room for cargo. Car is easy to drive and feels a lot smaller than it really is. While it won't break any records on the 1/4 mile it is plenty powerful enough for most situations.",4
1514,"This is a superb car to drive or for a ride. It has more than enough power to get you into interstate traffic or pass other cars. I get about 42.3 MPG, the other driver gets about 38.6 MPG. Our driving is at the edge of the southern end of the Rockies @ an elevation of 6,000 feet. It handles both the hills and elevation with ease. Handling is sure. The fit and finish are what Detroit dreams about. Seat adjustments make interior comfort great for the driver and passengers. The A/C is superb. In summer, the car really cools down quickly, even in our desert environment. The sound system is the best ""standard"" system I ever had in a car. It is quite pleasing.",4
1515,"My previous car was an E350 MB. While I loved the handling and styling of the car, I chose the R-class for the room and seating capacity. However I was also surprised with the way the car handles and I really love the styling. I pretty much leave the rear seats down but I like knowing that they are available if needed. I love how long the cargo space is with the 2nd row laid down for extra room If I need to haul longer items. Right now with the great lease and retail programs they have on the R- class, it makes it a great value.",3
1516,"With 4 months and 3,000 miles now logged I feel I can offer some insight. With the Honda nameplate you obviously are getting a quality vehicle. I'm planning on getting 10 years/110,000 miles out of it and then handing down to my son in elementary school for college use. I did lots of research beforehand and wanted the optional 3rd row w/out having a huge vehicle. Bingo! My colleagues piled in for a trip with the 6' 1"" guy choosing to sit in the way back. He said he was comfortable...but he didn't look it. They all commented on how much bigger it looked and felt inside than what they thought it would be. I upgraded from a Jeep Gr. Cherokee, and this is hands-down far superior.",4
1517,"After a month of thorough research I narrowed it down to the Frontier and Tacoma. The Tacoma was roomier. It does have some spongy brakes that need to get used to (TRD 4x4). Interior is an A+! Good power and ride. Very comfortable seating. I have owned Chevys all my life. This is the first Toyota that I have purchased. Sold my 04 Colorado Z71 crew cab. This blows it away hands down. Even though I bought the fully loaded Colorado, it just feels cheap to drive when compared to the Tacoma. Great job Toyota! Some additional lighting for the 4x4 and various other switches would help. Also, I had to order a cabin filter. Toyota makes the slot for one but does not place one in there? C'mon.",1
1518,"I like the interior almost as well as the exterior. In 1 word: fabulous! The top is easy to put up and take down contrary to some reports. This is my first convertible, and I expected much more wind noise with the top up, and was pleasantly suprised it was quieter than I'd expected. Handling is excellent, and mileage is respectable for what it is, a convertable roadster. Anyone who doesn't like this car either has kids or dogs, or needs/wants too much stuff around them at all times. This car wasn't intended for the masses. Space for two is all I need. The price makes it a real value, and it makes me feel good that GM has finally made a car that generates this much interest from foreign car shoppers.",3
1519,"The Toyota Sienna LE engine is very noisy in comparison to my 10 years old Plymouth Grand Voyager. I drove my friend's 2007 Sienna CE, the noise level is exactly the same as the LE: LOUD. The highway road noise is higher than expected.",2
1520,"I love this car! I own an 04 Jetta and an 08 Passat, as well. Other than missing the navigation upgrade, we often mistake it for the Passat. In- fact we call it the Mini-Passat The ride, comfort and road noise compared to the the 2004 Jetta is hands- down much better.",3
1521,"Being my first Lexus, this 2007 GS350 has spoiled me. I'm not sure I can shop for another manufacturer once my lease is up. But I have experienced some minor quality control issues that are annoying. Within the first 13 months, both side view mirrors gave out and required replacement (occurred at different time), the memory positions for the passenger front seat stopped working (replaced a solenoid), The sunroof wouldn't flip open (replaced a solenoid) and the motorized trunk would not secure (replaced a mechanism within the motor). These have all been nuisance repairs but disappointing none the less. Mechanically, the car is trouble-free.",2
1522,If you have not had trouble yet just wait. Not only have I had numerous problems but the dealership is as bad. Steering noise AC went out Brakes Squeel Now steering rack WHATS NEXT !!! 07 car of the year???????,1
1523,"I love this car. Black pony with 18s, leather. Looks great, nice sound system, rides nice, adequate power. It was also relatively inexpensive for a well equiped car. Car had zero defects. Gets 24 highway for real, but averages only about 18-19 combined city/highway. Regular gas though, most performance vehicles use only premium.",3
1524,"Traded in a gas-guzzling SUV for my Civic Si and couldn't be happier. I love the small steering wheel, relatively short throw shifter, exhaust sound and the handling. Seeing how well it handles the ride is actually fairly comfortable for this type of car. The exhaust isn't loud and weed-eater-like but it has a nice hum to it at 6000rpm's. I've been averaging around 32 mpg @ 75 mph.",3
1525,"What's the Caddy commercial say about returning the favor? Yes! My JGC definitely returns the favor! Nice ride, fun to drive and the 4.7L has great pick-up. Haven't tried the E85 yet - so can't comment on performance/mileage there. Now that gas prices are down - my purchasing a V8 in June when gas was near $4 doesn't look so stupid. How are people complaining about gas mileage in these reviews? You saw what the EPA estimates were when you bought it - as long as you're not getting worse mileage than EPA estimates, how can you rate gas mileage as poor? I'm consistently getting a couple of more mpg in comparison to EPA estimates. Got 21mpg on 600 mile highway trip recently.",3
1526,"The X5 is an exceptional SUV. We looked at the Acura MDX and you can't really compare the two. If you can afford the additional $15k, go for the X5. We have had it for three months and it has functioned flawlessly. The drive is awesome and the finish in incredible.",4
1527,"It was an impulse buy - hooked up with the dealer over the internet, real nice sales guy...followed up, went into the dealership about 2 days later (right down the street), went out for a test drive, loved it, and before I knew it, I was signing papers. Haven't looked back since. I love this car.",4
1528,I really enjoys driving it. It feel like a Sport and Work Truck all in one.,3
1529,I traded my 2003 Tahoe for the 2008 Altima S yesterday. It had 6 miles on it when I drove it off the lot. It has 96 now. I love driving it. The gas mileage is great and the main reason for buying it. The style is a lot sportier than the Accord and Camry. I love the CVT. It is extremely comfortable and has lots of storage in the glove box and trunk. I've driven a V8 for the last five years and was happily surprised at the power in this 4 cylinder. I can't wait to take it on a long trip. My daugher loves the back seat. She has plenty of room and finds it very comfortable. The keyless entry and pushbuttom start are great. The ride is smooth. You can't go wrong with this car!!,3
1530,"I just purchased a 2008 Rondo today. I think I made a mistake. The test drive took place in city traffic where I didn't see some of the flaws. On the long drive home there was a very annoying sound at the driver's window (air coming in). The car is very ""floaty"" & seems too wishy washy on the road. I don't feel in command of my vehicle. The 4 cylinder engine whines so loud, like it may explode before we really get rolling. I am thinking of taking it back in the morning & getting my money back. This is a cheap car & I don't feel safe in it.",1
1531,"I traded in the 2007 cobalt ltz for the tc when I saw it in town. This car is amazing, the looks is great black top on White. Pioneer cd player/ipod just wonderful. I'm really surprised how comfy and roomy the car is. Since its a coupe I assumed how small it will be inside. This is a car I will be keeping around for years or till a new and improved tC comes out. And yes the girls do love it. ; ]",4
1532,"I had been driving a 1998 V-6 Accord. It took me a couple of weeks to learn how to drive the Civic hybrid. My mileage has been around 42-44 mpg and from the other reviews I?ve read, I?m sure my mileage will improve as my driving habits improve. I couldn?t be more pleased with its performance. It has plenty of acceleration and handles very well. It has a bigger interior feel that what you might expect for its size. By the way, I paid $23,100 with navigation",3
1533,"I read all the reviews and researched the Astra religiously online and I ended up buying it without even test driving anything else. All the good reviews from this site alone really provoked me. Its a very solid feeling car and built very well(in Belgium I might ad) with tight bonds all over the place. No rattles here at all. I got a 5 speed, fully loaded, every option avail including the sports, handling package with 17's and 45 series tires. I have never been in a car that handles as well as this. Period. I see maybe 1 other Astra in a week where I live and I wonder why. At the price I got it for over $6500 off MSRP. I stole it off the lot! A premium European 5 door hatch at its finest.",4
1534,I had this car for 3 weeks now and like the cars performance overall. I wish it had more torque like the lexus. The lexus is350 had a stronger motor and was more comfortable inside. The bmw was just an overall nicer car. I guess you get what ya pay for. The g35 also has hard seats and loves to burn fuel. I get about 15-16 mpg around town. The g35 doesn't handle as well as a bmw in high winds or at high speeds. It gets loose in the turns at high speeds. Sure hope gas prices don't climb again.,3
1535,"After 6 weeks of owning the car and 3,000 miles I noticed Paint chips on the side in front of the rear tires. I took it to the dealer and they took pictures and sent them to Mitsubishi and they said they wouldn't cover it that it was my fault. The front tires kick off stones causing a sandblasting to the side of the car. They said they didn't make mud flaps for them yet. It gets worse everyday. I see more people are having the same problem. I am now filling out paper work for the attorney General.",1
1536,"I test drove the Honda CR-V, Hyundai Santa Fe, Suzuki XL7, and Subaru Forester before I bought my Jeep Liberty. For the money, it was by far the best deal.

1537,"I have the LS regular cab with 4.8 V8 and am pleased with the truck. It has excellent pickup, is quiet, and is quality built inside and out. Very impressed, owned a F150 previously and this truck beats it in every significant category.",4
1538,"The 2007 E550 offers many improvements over previous E models: 7 sp trans, 5.5 ltr motor and no electric brakes. I have just completed a trip to LV from OC and MB still needs to work on the air suspension. No setting works well. The AMG E-63 suspension (recalibration of the air suspension and thicker sway bars)which has had great reviews cannot be ordered on the E550, even though the 550 has 382HP? The E550 also comes with R rated M & S tires? The front rotors are cross drilled yet R rated tires? Per the owners manual 'if speeds over 100mph are anticipated the tires must be over inflated which may cause rough riding around town'? If you like the styling drive a 550 BMW.",3
1539,"Handling is awesome. Power is incredible. I tried the DS mode and the steptronic and car left in a hurry. Fuel economy so far is about 24 MPG 75%/25% highway/city. Seems to do badly in stop and go traffic. Test drove a C300, IS250, and C230. BMW was far superior in all categories.",3
1540,"Sold Jeep Grand Cherokee. Thought may lose interior space & power, but very pleased CR-V has plenty of space & 4 cyl has surprising zip. Smooth ride & good turn radius. Compared to Toyota Rav4 & Jeep Liberty. CR-V better vehicle/price for money. CR-V fun to drive, smooth ride, lots of head/leg room interior, avg 22-26 mpg so far but dealer says will increase after 1st oil change. Told by several people CR-V exterior similar to Lexus & BMW 4WD.",3
1541,For never being a Ford person I was very skeptical even test driving this vehicle. After test driving the fusion and seeing all of the extras available I became a believer. I did my research and found this to be the best car for the price I wanted. After having this car for a while I have absolutely no regrets. I am just as happy as the day I bought it. I was suprisingly happy with the highway gas milleage as I am getting on average 31 MPG. Adding in city driving I got just under 27 MPG average.,4
1542,"Looked at them all and have owned Lexus RX & Honda Pilot in past. This SUV is the best I have owned so far. Only have 3000 miles on it but have nothing but praise for performance and quality. First US made car in many years. The VUE brought me back. Did 2000 mile trip in first 2 weeks and it was flawless. GM can compete if they keep the mentality they put into the VUE. Stopped by dealership on a lark and owned the car in one day. 4 cylinder just didn't make it, but 6 is a dream. Make sure you drive it before you buy anything else, I know you will love it.",4
1543,Just purchased used hhr as second vehicle for the family. So far we are enjoying it. Have spent some money on performance upgrades and a set of wheels (had to get rid of those ugly hub caps) now my son doesn't call it lame looking any more. Could use some help in the interior though. Needs the center arm rests located a little higher so you can place a cup in the holder without having to raise the arm rest and it would also make it a little more comfortable. Please keep up the good work in the design of cool looking little economy cars. Not those lame looking hybribs (prius) that the competition makes.,3
1544,"We bought a 2007 Ford 500 and we have 93,000kms on it already. I am 77 years old a retired professional transport driver and have had a lot of cars in my life time. I Have never had a vehicle that is as reliable for driving in the snow, ice and slush of Alberta Winters. We have gone to Alaska, and Nova Scotia and never had one ounce of trouble. Love It love It Love It!!!",4
1545,"This is my second Lexus experience and it is awesome. I have owned a few European cars and Lexus is a much better over all package. The Lexus standard equipment is more comprehensive than its competitors which charge 10K more for the same car. The acceleration, ride, and handling are spot on. The leather is the best in the industry and the ergonomics are perfect. I read a lot of complaints about the hidden controls but I enjoy not having the dash cluttered up with controls that I do not use frequently.",3
1546,"I purchased my 2008 explorer 17 days ago. This is my 6th Explorer since 91. The 2008 model year is nicely styled, although personally I like the 05 much better - much classier look opposed to the chrome bars and round gauges. At first I hated the center mounted shift knob but my hand rests on it when using the arm rest, so its actually comfortable. Like others have said, interior parts are cheap. Overall I like Explorers, but this 08 has had a number of issues. In 17 days of ownership (bought with 16,200 mi on it) a speaker died, a part in the catalytic converter system failed and needed to be replaced, and the no cap gas cap filler neck had to be replaced due to improper sealing.",3
1547,I went from a Honda Odyssey to the Ford Edge and I could not be happier. I am always being asked if I like the car or not by admirers and I can't stop raving about it. I had transmission problems with the Honda since day one but my Edge is a year and a half and it runs perfectly. I am happy to buy an American car from now on after this purchase.,4
1548,"Skinny front tires and auto trans makes ABS come on with every stop in snow. The rear wheels are always trying to drive forward as you come to a stop, so it's up to the fronts to stop the car AND the motor. I've gotten in the habit of popping it into neutral as I'm stopping. I have no confidence in slippery stopping times. Roads made bumpy by frost heaves and potholes make for a punishingly harsh ride. The suspension must have only a couple of inches of travel because it doesn't take much to jolt the whole car on a bump. But when the roads are dry and smooth it's fun to drive. Nice around town.",2
1549,"Overall, I love the Sorento; however, at &lt;15000 miles, the rotors had to be replaced and now at &lt;28000 miles they're having to be replaced again. (Not my braking habits! I've been driving for almost 30 years and never had a problem with brakes!) Also, I've noticed the hesitation in speed/acceleration during driving. Sometimes it's slow to respond in a stop/go situation (slowing to a near stop then accelerating again)...kind of scary. I've been told it's because the vehicle/computer is adjusting to my manor of driving.(? At any rate, still happy with the vehicle overall.",3
1550,"I've mainly purchased BMWs and Audis, probably a good reason for that. My wife and I test drove the 08 GLI 4dr with DSG. Transmission was fairly jumpy in my mind, breaks were not as solid, and the handling was very loose. Of course I'm coming from a 06 325i and comparing it to this VW. In my mind it isn't as sporty as some people think it is or handles as well. A vehicle that compares well to BMW that is not an Audi or Mercedes, is the 08 Mini Cooper S AM. I was very impressed with this vehicle and probably will purchase one. And I know that VW makes Audi and etc. But transmissions are different, i don't think the DSG compares well enough to Audi's tiptronic nor BWM's SMG. Sorry.",2
1551,"This is a car that you would want to drive. The only reason you wouldn't want to drive this car is only because you're used to high high quality cars i.e. Porsche. But overall, this car is fun, looks good, and is reliable. I love this car so far and future modifications will make it even more fun!",3
1552,"Very very quiet and comfortable car. The ride is so fun, in the way that I am amused by not hearing the engine sound so much, and not feeling the road. I get to enjoy my CDs and watch the FE gauges. The car feels very stable as if driving a mini-tank, yet it is very responsive and fast. I don't know how quiet and comfortable Lexus can get, but after getting this car for $26.3k out the door, I don't think I'd wanna go for Lexus for $$$ more.",3
1553,"I really do like this car, but the only problem is that there isn't enough power. I would've gone for the V6, but they didn't have it in a manual. In any case, the reliability and build quality of the car is great (my family has owned 4 Fords in the past and this is definitely the best). The interior isn't any worse than the Accord or Camry, but all three are pretty ugly. The interior design is simple (which is a good thing) and the leather wrapped stick feels great to drive.",3
1554,"The Tiburon GT, at minimum, is adequate in every area. It's ride is smooth and nimble. The experts claim that the handling is ""numb"", but I have found it to be the best handling car that I have ever driven.(That includes Acura TL, Acura CL, Honda Civic, Ford Taurus SHO, and Ford Mustang) The brakes are extremely responsive and took some getting use to. The engine is a little weak, considering it is a V6 with 172 HP, but it will give enough pep for realistic driving. I have been extremely pleased with the gas mileage. Critics, and Hyundai themselves have posted 17/23 MPG, while I have been consistently getting 25-27 MPG when driving conservative. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase.",3
1555,"I have not purchased a new domestic vehicle since my 1974 Camaro SS. The Acadia is the first vehicle since that attracted me enough to make the switch. While the MPG isn't quite where I hoped it would be, I am averaging around 20 mpg with a combo of heavy freeway stop and go traffic. On a recent road trip to Arizona, I averaged about 24mpg, which I was quite satisfied with. I am very happy with this vehicle. For a versatile, all around utility vehicle with style and comfort, I don't think that you can beat it.",4
1556,"I just logged 22K on my Avenger and haven't had any problems with it. I change my own oil, have the tires rotated and balanced and wash it every now and then. It really is a great car to drive, it doesn't have the power of the beefier 3.5L Avenger, but the 3.5l isn't getting the great gas mileage either. I consistently get about 27-29 Hwy/City per gallon. I can take a 5 hour trip (75MPH) and not have to stop for gas. The interior is a little ""plastic"", but it's functional and has the beverage chiller to boot! I did not opt for the sport package they offered, but I've seen others and it does add quite a bit of flair to exterior, it looks great as it sits though. Overall, it's a great car.",3
1557,"I saw my first dream car when I was 15. A red conv Shelby GT 500. All I could think was someday! I have since owned other performance cars including Corvette's, Camaro's, Saleen's at 560hp. All of which I was and remain impressed with. What can I Say,I am a 12yr old gear head with a decent job that lets me play. Then I got my 2008 Vapor GT500 Conv. My wife will tell you I cant say enough about it. The GT500 was awesome, But I felt it lacked immediate throttle response. A Evolution Perfomance kit (Air Intake, smaller pulley 4psi boost, and a re-program for a quick 640hp)put me into pure wow mode. The GT500 has looks open roof and real power. I am living my American Dream",4
1558,"I couldn't be happier with this truck. Got such a great deal that I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Comfortable interior, great classic look and power.",4
1559,"I traded my 01 Escape for and 08 Escape Hybrid, and I'm loving it. I'm averaging about 32mpg. The engine turning off and going to electric takes some getting used to because it feels like your car has stalled. It also took some getting used to not having the power of the v6, but the car does great for the size and only being 4cyl. It's roomy enough for 2 children in the back. Blind spots are not that bad for a suv. Tons of storage space and little cubby spaces. Not that many out there so it was hard to find the color I wanted...black. This car makes my wallet happy",4
1560,"This is easily the best car I have ever driven. The handling is amazing and the styling is great! It is truly fun to drive! The 328xi is a bit more sluggish when accelerating than the 328i, but the slight difference in performance is outweighed by the superior handling of the 328xi on icy/snowy roads. You won't be disappointed with this car, especially if you live in a place with harsh winters!!",4
1561,I love my new 2007 Honda CR-V. This is a great vehicle that has exceeded all of my expectations. I love the way this car handles and all the features you get for the money. Honda did a great job when redesigning this car. I feel very safe driving this car.,4
1562,"I was looking for a compact car with great mpg, enough room for 4 other passengers, lots of features, reliability, low-maintenance, and good resale value. Civic was the perfect fit. Just bought it a month ago. Many people complimented on nice atomic blue color. I'm somewhat disappointed by the mpg. I realized that the advertised 30/40 mpg is unrealistic, but I still expected it to be better than what I'm getting. I got only 21 mpg on the first tank, then average 28 mpg after that (combined city/highway). It doesn't seem to get any better, but I'll see. MP3/WMA player is nice. Audio control on the steering wheel is great. Must get used to not being able to see the front of the car.",3
1563,"With gas prices rising I knew it was time to trade in the F-150 King Ranch. I test drove hybrids and did the math. This car made the most sense to me. I drive 50/50 city/hwy. Right now I have less than 1,000 miles on the motor, waiting to see if the mpg meets my expectations. Also read the ""cost to operate""...Civic looked good! This is a cheap car and so you get what you pay for. If you have champagne taste, this is not the car for you. Have your list of extras that you like, and find the Honda that fits you. Don't complain later! You're suppose to be an adult.",3
1564,Just bought a 2007 Crewmax Ltd. Really happy with the truck. This is my first truck. My wife also loves it. Always dreamt of having one. Wanted to buy an all American Chevy. Test drove one along with Tundra. Changed my mind and got Tundra. Superior handling and style. Smooth engine.,3
1565,"I've driven my Fit for almost 2 years now. I don't have any major complaints. I drive a 30 mile commute twice a day on highways and average 36 mpg- cruising at around 75 MPH. I can get 3 grandkids (one in a booster seat), a large Lab in the back end and 2 adults up front. I've carried large boxes and lumber with ease. A 1300 mile road trip in my manual transmission Fit was most comfortable and economical. Last winter I was rear ended and the back end smashed up pretty bad- but the safety features in the crumple zone prevented any human tragedy.",3
1566,"This is a very comfortable convertible and can actually hold two people in the back seat! The car has enough power for most situations. The trunk is great (roomy) for a convertible. Needs automatic seat adjustment, larger rear window, and a better navigation system. The navigation system will tell you to turn once you are past the turn!",3
1567,I had an '06 Escape and loved it. Traded for a Mustang and recently traded back to an Escape. Great visibility and comfort. Gas mileage on the '06 was at 24 and hope to do as well on the '07. Lots of interior room with great storeage behind the back seat. Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a SUV that does not need the third seat.Glad I went back to the Escape.,4
1568,"I guess I can start by saying this car is my mid-life crisis car, anyway the car performs everytime time I put my foot into. It fires like a bullet, no complaints for power, but there are some other problems so beware. My vehicle has had molding on the driver & passengers side replace twice for peeling. Front windshield crack and replaced due to body stress as descibe in my documentation. Rear differential went out grining noise when backing up or going around curves. Dealer wants to add rear differential TSB-additive waste of time. My passenger door has a continous rattle in the center of the panel with very little volume on speakers. GM fix is adding foam to interior of door, doesn't work.",3
1569,"We took a trip to Florida on vacation from KY and the car did better than advetised on fuel mileage. I checked it every time I fueled up and got 34 mpg at the best and adveraged 32.5-33 mpg. It is a Fusion S with some options and auto transmission. Simply put I would definitely buy another Ford product. No wonder all the reveiws are excellent for this car. I would rate it better than Toyota, equal with Honda, and far superior to Chevy according to people who i know have the Malibu",3
1570,"I love everything about this car except the lack of power and maneuverability on snow - it likes to slip, slide, and get stuck in a couple inches of snow pretty easily (I live in Wisconsin). In non-snow and non-icy conditions, it drives smoothly and has plenty of pep for the size. I love the way it looks inside and out. It is roomier than it would appear from the outside. The cupholders are extremely handy - better placed than any other car I have owned. Best of all, I get excellent gas mileage - overall I get around 34-35 mpg, but on a long all-highway trip I am able to get 38. That's hard to beat with a non-hybrid - and this car is comfortable! I would highly recommend this vehicle overall!",3
1571,"This is the best Pontiac car ever. I think it blows away the gto by comparison and has a huge trunk and back seat. Head room is miles long and for a 6'3"" 240 pound guy i am sooo comfortable while driving i strongly recommend.",4
1572,"I went through an exhausting research process to decide on a car. I read every review, and drove more cars than I can count. Eventually, I narrowed it down between the '08 Accord Coupe w/ Nav, Audi A4 3.2 Quattro, BMW 3 Series, and only had the G35 left to drive. After I drove the Infiniti, I realized there was no comparison. The power, handling, and comfort are incomparable, and the price is incredibly reasonable for such an awesome car. I have people compliment my car everywhere I go!",4
1573,Love the vehicle. First new vehicle for me in 20 years. Very nice drive. More confortable and better handling then Pilot test drive.,4
1574,"2007 Ford Fusion SEL (4 cyl. 4dr sedan) I'll be honest, I never thought I'd own a Ford vehicle that wasn't a Mustang or a truck but the Fusion has changed my mind. My husband and I purchased our '07 in May of this year and we've loved every minute of driving this vehicle. The Red Fire Metallic with the Charcoal Black leather interior turns heads and my Dad who has always driven Audi's thinks this car is extremely impressive. We drove it from NJ to KS on our family vacation this year and couldn't believe how comfortable it was. Do yourself a favor and get a Fusion. You won't regret it. We plan on purchasing a second Fusion in Spring of '08 for me.",4
1575,"Every imaginable gadget, great looks, great ride, it did not disappoint. Got just under 32 MPG driving to work today (25 miles in stop and go traffic). The car is great, if you could just actually order one with what you want in it, that would be big.",4
1576,The car drive exceptionaly smooth and it give great pick up. The driver seat is very acommadating for short people like myself. I like the safty features alot especialy the passager air bag and the extra number rear seat belts.,3
1577,I've had my explorer for about a year now and i still hate it. first off i'm a mountain biker. When i tried to haul a trailer full of weight weenis CrossCountry mountain bikes the Explored bogged down. also there needs to be some fairly substantial mud flaps on this car. Very disapointing V8. No one can figure out where the inner door handles are and the outside look is about as plain as you can get. this car is unbelievably clumsy and lurpish in real 4 wheelin situations i don't trust it.,0
1578,"This car runs and runs fast. You will think there is a bigger motor than the mini mill. All the Honda quality is there and not any real issues. You may have to live without a few items, but the gas pump will not make you pay. The lack of a dead pedal is not a problem either. The driving position is a bit awkward on a long road trip. It is workable however. This car is highly recommended. Keep looking and find a dealer who will work with you and don't buy from the arrogant Honda dealer.",3
1579,"After 8 years with my volvo S-80 it was time for change. I looked at the new S80 and the Toyota Avalon. The S80 was much like my 2000 and too much money considering the questionable quality of my old car. The Avalon was a good driving car but seemed a bit boxy. Driving the ES 350 was the clincher. Fun, quiet, responsive and comfortable. The Lexus trunk is a better shape than either of the others and the opening much larger.",3
1580,"Fit, finish, and paint are great. Engine powerful, auto transmission flawless. Quiet ride (I had mine undercoated). Pulls pop-up trailer (2500 lbs)without effort. No rattles, wind noises, or other problems. Had Nissans in the past, but I love this Ranger.",3
1581,"This is one great car! I love to drive it, steering is tight and it turns on a dime. Love the gas mileage - close to 30 city and 42 highway. Fit and finish are great. No problems with car. Inside and out, the styling blows the competition away! Many compliments on the way the Civic looks!!",4
1582,"When I walked into the dealership and saw comparably priced Jeeps and other SUVs, I felt as though I should hang my head in shame for considering a minivan at $40,000. As it turns out, this may be the greatest purchase yet! I think I just purchased a living room on wheels. We opted for the limited- which has tons of extras- and surprisingly, really wasn't that much more expensive. Before the trade, I got this vehicle for a hair under $37k, and I am pretty sure there aren't any options that didn't come on it. The real reason we went for the limited was the upgraded seats, which are extremely comfortable.",4
1583,"Honda has kept with their roots and made the most impressive car in its class. there are a few cars that may go faster becasue of larger engines and/or turbos. this 2.0 dohc i-vtec engine screams all the way to 8000 rpms and will smoke the competion that hasnt cheated by adding v6 or forced induction motors. The torgue is low for a performace car, but nontheless the car is zippy and the speed sneaks up on you. The 6 speed has short gears and pulls in all of them. The interior is very unique and some may not like it, but I feel right at home. It's a performance car, not meant for the average driver. Obviously I just got this car, so I cant say how the reliablitly is, but it's a Honda..enough said.",4
1584,I dont know what everyone is talking about. My minivan has been great! Everything works fine except the passenger side auto door wont close the first time we hit the button. Big whoopity do though. We drive this van everywhere and its been 100% reliable and we've had no issues whatsoever. Great van that I love to drive and the kids thoroughly enjoy being in on trips!!!,4
1585,"I two weeks ago I traded in my 2006 E350 for the 2008 E350. The handling and engine sound are much improved and there is more aviable options and combinations. I got my E350 with dvd navigation, premium 2 pkg, ipod integration, electronic trunk closer,voice control, and keyless go. The color is Sienna Black metallic which reflects red but appears to be black and the sahara/beige interior ( very nice combination). It had a MSRP or 60,500 and had a sticker price lower than a E550. I am delighted.",4
1586,I traded in my 2003 G35 for the 2008 model. I never repeat same brands or styles but my first G35 (purchased in April 2002) was the best car I have ever owned. Never had mechanical issues. Performance never changed in almost 6 years and the long term overall quality was excellent.,4
1587,"For long I have wanted a SUV, but It seem to me that there was not one available with a gas conscience. I always thought that GM made big, clumsy, thirsty, cars, boy was I wrong. I just love my new VUE. The looks is great, the interior is amazing, and the quality is reaching the same quality demanded from an average consumer. The engine is powerful and you can barely notice at the gas gauge, like in the old days. The VVT seems a bit slow to react when going to high revs, but when it gets there you will notice. The heated seats are not very useful down south, but came standard with the trim package. The 6 six speed transmission sometimes is also slow to react, ( My previous car was a 5 speed",3
1588,"This truck is great. It has tons of power, seats are very comfortable, 6 speed trans is great, SR5 package is great. This truck is huge, everybody who comes close to look all say it. Number of gauges and what they are for is very comprehensive. Auto trans temp gauge was great idea. Build quality is very good. Comes with Michelin tires. 6 speed trans with sequential shifting is nice feature. Two haul mode is nice feature as well. Stock radio/CD player does the job nicely. Plenty of drink holders. Plenty of storage behind seat. I got rid of an undependable Ford F150 and could not be happier with my choice of trucks.",4
1589,I've had this CR-V for 3 months now. I have not had one disappointing moment. It drive just like a car. I don't have problems passing other cars or trucks. I've been to NY and it gave me 28 miles to the gallon. Around the city I get 23 miles but the combo is 21/22. I totally love this car. This should have been the first car I purchase instead I went in the opposite direction and purchased a 2007 Dodge Caliber (one of the worst cars on the road).,4
1590,"I have owned my Santa Fe for about 6 weeks now and love everything with/about it. Gas mileage has improved to 22.5 mixed driving (I have 2k miles on vehicle). Very quiet, smooth ride, love my heated leather seats even though I'm in the south. I didn't think I would use the heat but leather is cold in mornings. No transmission problems, it's a fantastic vehicle with great rebates. Oh, the stereo system with 6 disc and infinity speakers sounds awesome! Sunroof is quiet too. No complaints here at all. I would highly recommend this vehicle. My other top running choices were Rav 4 or Highlander but the price I paid for what I got beat Toyota by far. I mean they got 100k mile warranty included.",4
1591,"I bought this car after trying the BMW 328i, the Lexus IS 350, the VW Passat , and the Nissan Murano. Let's just say there was no contest. The Passat and the Murano were nice but not in the same level, the Lexus was heavy and at times I almost had to shake the car to move, and the BMW though handled well, wasn't as much fun as driving this or even half as decently equipped. This car impressed me from the get go. It handled well on the curves and on the straight line. It is smooth to drive, and I can hit 75 effortlessly. The interior is extremely sleek, the Japanese finish is a nice touch and the seats are very comfy. The backup camera takes trust but it is easier than I thought to gain.",4
1592,Thought I'd switch to an economy car - this car won based on price/gas economy alone. It hasn't been worth it - I'd rather spend extra money on gas to have a car with some torque. The resale value looks great - will be moving up to something sportier in the 200+ hp/torque range. Not a bad car but it is the first/last Honda I will ever own. Realized its too vanilla for me. Didn't like seeing commuters driving them everywhere. Kind of a bummer.,1
1593,"After thoroughly reviewing several cars from BMW (3 and 5 series), Jaguar (XF), Mercedes (C class), Lexus (IS F), I settled upon the M45 sport, almost fully loaded (lacks mobile DVD system). Some of these cars are like comparing apples to oranges but, the M45 above all others is best in overall value to performance ? it has the best of all worlds. It offers great performance, plenty of space, excellent design and the best technology features of anyone. While all the other cars were always sorely lacking in some features (for example, the IS F lacks space, the Jag lags in technology, etc.), the M45 simply glimmers best in everything overall, and at a respectable price comparatively.",4
1594,"I purchased a base Equinox in 2005 and thought it was great, but needed a bit more power. I just upgraded to the sport model which has 90 more hp and other upgrades as well. I would recommend this car to anyone in the market for a small - medium sized SUV.",3
1595,"Took ED and drove 600 miles across So. Germany in 3 days. Ably handled everything from tight country roads, windy descents to 100+ mph cruising & stop n go on the Autobahn. Averaged 26+ mpg. Coming from Acura TL, never thought I'd say ""Good value"" about a BMW, but the performance, ride, sound and handling are so amazingly solid while seating 4, it's difficult to imagine why you'd spend so much more for a little impractical Porsche (compare 0-60), or unpredictable Maserati GT. Great touring, great speedster and terrific looking. Easily translates from mellow to ""let's go!"" especially at the touch of the ""Sport"" button. Higher revs, immediate response.",3
1596,"Great vehicle. A little more road noise than I was expecting even with the performance tires. Trunk opening is too small. Vehicle handles great, above average acceleration. Nav system is the pits, you need a comp science degree to figure everything out. Also very annoying that you can't operate the GPS Nav while driving. I know it's a safety feature but should be my choice. As is, it takes away at least 50% of its usefulness. Vehicle is just a tad too small for my taste on the interior.",3
1597,"Absolutely the best car I've ever owned! Great style, fuel economy, interior is flawless! Those foreign cars just got beat with a world class automobile! It's so quiet inside traveling down the highway and the stereo is fantastic. What a way to travel!",4
1598,"I was in my early 20's in the 70's Muscle car era. I had some of the best. The G8 GT brings back the thrill of driving that those cars gave back then. You know you have some thing special when a sheriff's Deputy follows you for 4 mile just to ask you how you like the car, and BMW 5 series driver parks next to you so he can get a close look at the G8. The car is very comfortable, and am still getting use to where all the switches are but so far has been a great experience. Mine is Panther Black, and with the stance of the G8 I have nick named it VADER.",3
1599,"I just purchased my S40 in Feb 09. I never thought of owning a Volvo but the dealer had this silver brand new 08, the sticker was $27,400. They let it go for $19,000 so how could I refuse. So far it is a very enjoyable car. Simple and very strong! I wish it had about 20 more HP, however it still is a wonderful car.",3
1600,"I bought this car in July and put appx 3300 miles on since. I just gave it my first oil change. This car is a complete MACHINE! Feels great on the road. Great fuel economy, outstanding performance off the line and from 60+. It's the enthusiast version so it has the limited slip and traction control. Really sticks to the road. Very maneuverable. I test drove the 2008 Mustang GT, Chevy Cobalt SS supercharged, Mazda rx8, Mitsubishi eclipse GT. The 08 350Z Enthusiast just blew them all away. Might have only 2 seats and room for golf bags, but in the end, no one can really fit in the ""4 seater sports cars"" anyway. Best car I have driven to date. Very happy.",4
1601,"I had a 2004 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 crew cab. I no longer need the truck to go into the woods. Several friends have Subarus. They always talk highly of them. I traded my truck in and got this vehicle. At first I wasn't pleased. It is a vehicle that takes time to get used to. I just went to NYC with my vehicle. I got 33 mpg, 27 mpg in the city. If you obey the speed limits you will get very good mileage. If you need to ""punch it"" when driving, it is very slow to respond. The back seat isn't made for adults. I do like the dash board display. If you need to replace 1 tire, then you need to replace all 4 of them because of the symmetrical awd. Thats something they don't tell you when you buy the car.",2
1602,"Made the quick decision to downsize once gas prices moved towards $4/gallon. This Mazda5 has the entire family's rapt adoration. We and our two kids (9 and 11) find it to be an ideal vehicle with its surprisingly versatile and roomy interior space and its remarkable fuel efficiency. In mixed driving situations, I am averaging 28 MPG with my lowest numbers at 25 MPG and my highest highway-only tank at 33 MPG. This car is peppy, sporty, and eye-catching (lots of comments from others). We'll be taking it soon on its first cross-country trip. I may have more to report then. To this point, I say ""Thumbs up. Way up, on this very cool little car!""",3
1603,"Get 47.8 to 55.3 MPG. Package 3 that has more features than the car it replaced. Comfy ride everywhere I go. Sound heavy vehicle that is very smooth and fun to drive. Wasn't interested at first because thought it was too small until I test drove one. Very impressed with what I saw, and walked away that day with one!",4
1604,I have wanted a truck for some time and choose this vehicle over the F-150. My experience so far with this vehicle has confirmed I made the right choice. I particularly like the fact that it does ride very smooth. I don't like the fact that the air conditioner automatically switches back to outside air. I haven't figured that out yet.,3
1605,"Love it. Has everything, sound system, bluetooth (connects and disconnects when needed, tried other manufacturers' systems, not happy), voice control, best rear view camera that displays image in milliseconds and has lines and noise alarm, anyone can park safely. Also great when rearing with a boat trailer. Engine has so much trust. Cannot drive without intelligent cruise control anymore. Luxurious, comfortable and roomy. It is like flying first class.",4
1606,"This GMC Acadia had got to be one of the most solid vehicles built to date. From the luxurious interior features, sleek body style, and the powerful engine, the Acadia is a must drive for anyone. I got my Acadia 4 days ago and all I can say is wow! Just sitting behind the wheel lets you know you are in for a fun drive. This car performs and without much effort. The interior is gorgeous. Of course you have to get the SLT package. The dual sunroof is the coolest thing. I never had a power liftgate but always wanted one. No regrets there. The rear DVD entertainment system is very nice. The kiddo just loves it! You need to drive one of these very soon. You will not regret it!",4
1607,"This is one great car. I had owned a 2006 CTS and test drove the new CTS, a G35x an A4 and the entry level Lexus. Here's the thing: you need to know what you really want. If you really want the driving experience, you have to get the 335 if you can afford it. I was skeptical, but the reviews really are right, there's no comparison. Other cars (CTS) are bigger, others are maybe better value propositions (G35x), but none match the driving experience. I had high hopes for the G35x since its close on paper, but its much less civilized in real life and I feel still a ways behind. BMW downsides are price and the back seat is bit tight, but I have two kids in car seats and it works ok.",4
1608,"We bought this car in early October and have already hit 5000 very enjoyable miles. We've run from NYC to Boston and back twice, one of those trips in the thick of the recent snowstorm. The AWD plowed through several inches of fresh snow (the electronic AWD lock being a very useful feature when the plows haven't come through yet). Having a V6 gives added confidence, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this car. I'm 6'2"" and quite comfortable up front. I have 4 kids under age 7, so the optional third row gets used at weekends. It's a little tight back there - cargo space pretty much disappears with the third row up & in use. When the kids are older we'll go for a Sienna.",4
1609,"Just an update after owning the Entourage SE for 6 months now. The only problem that we are having is that the check engine light comes on periodicaly. The owners manual says to check the tightness of the gas cap. So when it comes on, usually at about a half tank, I get out and unscrew the cap and retighten. Then by the next morning, the lights off. Some day I'll get my butt in gear and get it to the dealer. But other than that, the van has been nothing but fantastic. The kids love the DVD and the fact that the windows on the sliding doors go up and down. The wife loves the heated seats now that winter is coming and I love the horse power and smooth ride and the back up warning sensor.",3
1610,I am an avid Ford owner but am extremely disappointed to learn that at 54000 miles I am being told that yes they know there is a problem with the transmission (CVT) and they recognize the risk it poses to citizens but they are not willing to repair at their expense. I really don't want another car but cannot justify repairing this one.,1
1611,"I just completed a 600 mi. round trip to Crested Butte from Albuquerque in the new family wagon, including interstates, mountain passes, 2 lane roads, muddy dirt roads and even a few inches of snow. The '07 Passat Wagon was an all around pleasure for either driver or passenger. The ride is very comfortable, handling excellent with plenty of power (for me) on acceleration and the highways and hills. Excellent gas mileage as well; nearly 33 mpg highway. I opted for package #2, 17"" wheels and Dynaudio. Wow -- the Dynaudio is well worth the $$$! After 6 months of ownership I have neglible complaints about the vehicle. A little higher sticker, but a fine step up from our '05 Passat Sedan.",3
1612,Bought the 2008 Focus for the price and gas mileage. I am still on first tank and the mpg keeps climing. Can I believe this? Sometimes for long stretches it says I am at 55MPG. Usually goes to 43 or so. Only when I am going slow or accelerating fast does it drop. Could this be true? I have driven it 3 days now and my gas gauge as barely budged! Other than that the car is OK nothing exciting. Black window trim came loose before I got it home. I had to snap it back in myself!,2
1613,"I have has a Pontiac for the past 12 years. I absolutely love my LaCrosse. Just a few enhancements that would make it even better! I think the passenger seat should be electric, just as the drivers seat is. Climate control vents in the rear would alson be a great feature as well. I know I make my right buying decision with the Buick. Thanks GM",3
1614,"With negotiation, rebates and GM card earnings,paid $11,133 for all-option car listing at $17,255. City mileage 26-30mpg;no highway trips yet. I love this little car for what we have been using it for. It is comfortable, and although not a high performer, has plenty of zip for city and highway driving. I am impressed with the build quality,'though carpeting is not dense. Winter mats are $80 for the set, are a custom fit and have good water retention edges. Rear seat a little tight, but rarely used. Mud flaps offer great protection. Modest steering vibration (Engine idle feedback), but no worse than Honda Civic Hybrid. Our other cars are a newer Suburban and Tahoe, Corvette and Ford GT.",3
1615,"This is one ""great"" truck, hands down. You have the feel of complete control with this truck. The performance reminds me of the 1970 Pontiac Grand Prix I once owned. Runs like a ""scalded"" dog. The comfort and room in the cab is not touchable by any truck maker today. ""THE BEST TRUCK ON THE ROAD TODAY BAR NONE"".",4
1616,"Awesome...just awesome. My wife and I bought our Baby B a year ago for our 20th anniversary. We bought it specifically as a weekend car, hence the low miles. Our car is loaded with every option possible except for heated seats which we don't need in Houston. The car is stupidly fast, handles incredibly well and is built SOLID. I never really noticed a difference in build quality before with my American or Japanese cars...until I bought my first BMW. Tight is the only word that comes to mind. Since the 1 is still somewhat rare I get head turns everywhere I drive her. It really is an amazing car. p.s. We got a stick :p",4
1617,"I get raves from a lot of other drivers and what a blast to drive this V50 is. Fort Knox on wheels too as Volvo is famous for safety. The Japanese made tranny matched to the 218 ponies makes it a dream to drive. Easy to be at 80+ mph and feels like 40. Quick on acceleration, shoots from the gate and leaves a lot of other cars in the dust! I say Volvo finally got it right in styling, interior, safety, guts, all there! I upgraded wheels to 17"", tinted all windows and this baby stands out on the road.",3
1618,"I've only had this truck for about three weeks, but I'm so glad I bought it. This is my first Toyota and after driving it I'm sure it won't be my last. I've been a loyal Dodge fan for nearly 20 years, but the Tundra beats it hands down. It has more room, a much better ride, more power, more standard features... simply more. I loved the look of my '02 Ram and still think the '02 through '05 models are the best looking trucks on the road. The current styling and lack of options are what made me look at the Tundra. I am sure glad I did. It was by far the best choice I've made on a vehicle for a long time. I couldn't be happier with this truck.",4
1619,"I have had my GT for 9 months and it is getting better. Fuel mileage is up, it gets within 2 mpg of the 96 Monte Carlo LS I traded in, and the GT has 200hp more. If I keep my foot out of it average 17 mpg in town. The problem is keeping my foot out of the throttle. When you step down on it it is exhilarating.",4
1620,I traded in my 2002 GS 300 for this car after considering BMW and M35x. This car had excellent build quality and comfort in all areas. Acceleration is surprisingly fast. Love the manual shifting option.,4
1621,"I was hesitant while buying this car after testing both Acura SUVs, Lexus RX, Mercedes ML, Missan Murano, Infiniti FX, Porsche Cayenne and Audi Q7 and it performed the best. The only thing I disliked about the car is the limited availability. I live in Maryand and the closest I could find was in Virginia, 400 miles away from my dealer. I got the sport package and love it. The seats are more supportive than anything. One thing I would recommend on the car is getting a warranty on your tires. I got a nail in my tire after 1200 miles. It was a $450 tire. Luckily I got it insured. One thing that BMW never has gotten right on any car they have made is cupholders.",3
1622,"Drives and handles superbly in comparison to the Mercedes ML350 and Lexus GX470. More features like run flat tires, xenon headlamps, etc., are standard equipment but on the others they are options; nicer looking and zero cost maintenance warranty, the kind of warranty you used to be able to get with a Mercedes.",3
1623,"I shopped around for about a month or so for a few Ford Trucks . I went by accident by the Mitsubishi lot because I was driving around the auto mall and saw the Endeavor and there was only two left, I drove it and was like WOW this drives just like a car I do go on occasional trips and its great. It has every thing I could ask for great sound great ride . beautiful interior and decent gas mileage for the size. I would recommend this car to anyone , and if i ever get another car it will be a Mitsubishi for sure.",4
1624,"I was driving a big Honda Odyssey and getting 18MPG all around driving. I am getting a little over 30MPG on this new Focus and I love the way it handles. Where you turn the wheel is where it goes, great little car from Ford and just a couple little add ons would be nice. I miss the garage door opener in the visor & the automatic temp control, otherwise great care.",3
1625,"This purchase was for my wife. She was a minivan driver and I have always liked sport sedans. We were both ready to leave our minivan of seven years, but with 3 growing children ages 5 to 12, we needed to maintain 3 rows and 7 passenger capability. Since we have owned 2 previous Mazdas (I currently own the MZ3S) we were very excited about the CX-9. The CX-7 was nice but too small for our needs. This CX-9 fit our needs perfectly. Although a fairly large vehicle at about 200"" long and almost 5,0000 lbs, it drives like a sporty sedan on steroids. Acceleration is brisk and the ride is fairly smooth. The BSMS helps to minimize blind spots. Overall we are pleased with this vehicle.",3
1626,"Ok, I just got the little beast yesterday. I had a ball on the test drive and then had even more fun on my 48 mile commute. This transmission is smooth as glass and my roommate loved the exhaust tone when I rolled up to get something from him. I'm considering actually teaching my girlfriend to drive stick with this car. The easy clutch and short throw of the shifter will make her life easier.",3
1627,"Traded in 2003 3.2 TL. Had A4 before that and living in Northeast missed the AWD. Ratings lower for fun to drive as it is a matter of what you want....a small fun car like an A4 or BMW 3 Series to zip around and corner in or the luxury of a bigger car. I went for the luxury and am happy I did. The lower rating for the exterior design is because let's be honest this does not have the flash of some rivals. Otherwise, I love this car. Great upgrades, interior, loaded with bose stereo, bluetooth, nav. system. AWD fantastic thru 3 snowstorms that would have crippled TL. Car is solid and feel safe. Lot of highway, getting 21 MPG! TL never a prob, anticipate same or better with RL",3
1628,This is our third Outback H6. We bought our first Outback H6 in 2003 . This was our introduction to Subaru's Line. Since then we purchased 2005 and 2008 H6 model versions of the Outbacks. It is most reliable and fun to drive vehicle and it seems that Subaru just got it right all the way. Every model year gets better and better.,4
1629,"For just under 40k I got a 4matic with several of the other bells and whistles including Nav, heated seats, metalic paint, HK radio system with Bluetooth etc. etc. It performs exceptionally well. Pick up is great and excellent in the snow. I am in love with this car.",4
1630,"The 2008 SWB LS 460 is light years ahead of the 2007,",3
1631,"I gave up my Pontiac Montana with some hesitation. But the purchase of this car was a wonderful choice. It rides well, it is comfortable and sporty looking. I am a plus size woman and the comfort for me is wonderful. The only thing is I continue to get confused with the window controls not being on the doors. Otherwise a great car for the money.",3
1632,"Overall very happy I bought this truck - I've wanted it since I was 16, so it's about time! After 2k miles, averaging 18 mpg, w/ a range of 15.5 to 21 for city/highway driving. Definitely rides like a truck. Very happy with 4x4 performance - safely got me & my friends to the mountain w/o any problems. Double cab rocks. Great engine. Not very comfortable on long highway rides - a 4 hour trip to Boston was not comfortable. A minor complaint: my right toe almost always hits the wiring harness directly above the brack pedal when I switch my foot from gas to brake (size 9.5 boot)...FYI. Again, though, very happy I bought this truck - it IS the vehicle that drives by you that you wish you had.",3
1633,"This is my first new car and so far I love it, it's so smooth and so easy to drive it's unreal; after all it is an SUV. I've tested many small utes Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, etc. - it's the best of the bunch - not quite as many features as the Tucson but the Escape is quick and zippy and gets just as good gas mileage as the rest. The inside is simple; could be better but works for me. The only weird thing so far is when turning it turns great in big turns but in really shallow turns it's kind of hard on your wrist.",4
1634,As far as the mileage - this vehicle is a great downsizer from larger SUVs. I guarantee it will hold more stuff than your larger SUVs out there- due to it's design. And still it's power only drains about 22 \ 24 avg mpg. Great vehicle- very happy with it.,3
1635,"so far I have the entourage about seven weeks and have not had any problems with it. I have 1100 miles on it. I would like to get better gas mileage so far I have not taken it on a long trip to tell what kind of mileage I will get. I'm am very pleased so far, It had a 2500 rebate on it when I purchased it, great car for the money.",3
1636,"Having driven both, and now owning the Civic for a few weeks, I think the Civic Hybrid beats the Prius in roominess, handling and performance, with no penalty in gas mileage. This is a stylish, comfortable car that requires no sacrifice and pays dividends at the gas pump, and to the environment. This car replaced a 2005 CR-V, which I loved, but my gasoline consumption is down 50%. Way to go Honda!",3
1637,"We traded in a 1998 Toyota Corolla to purchase our 2007 Nissan Versa in order to save gas. The sticker on the window indicated that we would be getting 28 city and 35 highway miles. We have now owned this car for almost a year and are barely getting 23 miles to the gallon, a far cry from our old toyota that ran perfect. So not only due we now have a car payment but a car that gets horrible gas mileage. We've tried several times to off load this to purchase a car that gets good gas mileage only to find out that a car we paid $14,000 for less than a year ago is only worth around 9 or 10 thousand dollars. I'm so sad that we no longer own our toyota. Cute car, fun to drive but don't buy it to save.",1
1638,"I have compared all three major vans like odyssey, quest and sienna. No doubt Sienna tops among all three. With 8 passenger is really worth and the same thing in odyssey even kids can't sit it that middle seat (that much small). It's just a week I started driving this but still few negative points like you can't make the 2nd row as bench seat by removing the middle seat and no power option for opening trunk in LE models. If Toyota comes up with more option for LEs then no other minivan can come closer to this including odyssey.",3
1639,"I traded my 997 to to get what I perceived to be a peaceful luxury car that delivers a violent, soulful motor on command. I couldn't be happier. No more annoying tire noise competing with the sometimes flatuent, contrived exhaust note. Instead I get full luxury (including double-paned windows and felt lined wheel-wells to ensure tranquility) punctuated by refined violence upon driver demand. I also get an ipod interface and bluetooth. When I miss my 997 I can always take out my 87 911 for a visceral run. And when I really require a jolt my F355 delivers without fail. The S8 is always the car I reach for first... that says a lot.",4
1640,"I really am enjoying my Yaris. It is all I expected. I am getting great gas milage, I do mixed driving, getting 34-38 MPG. It is fun to drive and is cute. I first saw this car in Ireland about 2 years ago and was excited to see it State side when I needed a new car. I don't think it well sell well in America do to our lack of logic when it comes to cars. I love the car.",4
1641,"This is my 3rd MDX, I have had a 2001, a 2005 and now a 2008. This is the Best Bang for the Buck SUV on the road. Looks great inside and out. Good performance, good handling, decent feul economy (16 mpg on mixed driving) for a 300 horsepower engine and all these vehicles have proved very reliable.",3
1642,"Love my 2WD 5.7 L SR5 Sequoia. It is everything that the reviews say it is. Very large vehicle, yet handles surprisingly well. Easy to corner and park. Tons of power. Struggles with MPG in town, obviously, but really does surprisingly well on the highway. ""Sweet spot"" on the highway is about 68 for my Sequoia. Put the cruise on around there, and I consistently get 22-23 MPG, which is great to me. My SR5 came with a leather upgrade, and the quality is very high. Very happy so far with my purchase",4
1643,"6-speed transmission is annoying. Constantly shifting in town and in country. Interior dash and door panels are cheaply made. Same material I have in my GM work truck! Interior surface is hard to clean. Exterior is time consuming to dry off after washing it. Many nooks and crannies. Nice to look at, a pain to own. We sold ours!",1
1644,"I purchased the yellow SE in July and have been driving it everyday just smiling. The handling is great,and the seats are comfortable. I just love all the fun it is to simply go anywhere now in my new ""Sunflower Yellow"" bug. Gets tons of compliments and fits in the smallest spots. I updated mine with ""daisy"" steering wheel covers, flower vase, license plate, and seat covers for an even cuter look.",4
1645,"I bought it a month ago and it's phenomenal! Great on gas, I average 36 mpg and that's mostly street driving. This vehicle is so stylish! Great car at an affordable price. I see this vehicle lasting many years. It's fits any liftstyle, I'm single with no kids and I think its very stylish, but it also has room for a few car seats should I decide to upgrade in that area soon! If you want a reliable, fun to drive, economical, stylish sedan this is it! I recommend the manual drive!",4
1646,"Honda does it yet again...adding 36 HP over my '97 model and approximately 5 more miles to the gallon to boot; a very modern look; and a sensible gauge display and voice-controlled navigation system all centered around making sure that you, the driver, are focused on the road. Curtain-side as well as front air bags, ABS, and electronic brake distribution add even more to the car's overall safety. It's fun to drive and it looks awesome. This is not your parents' economy car anymore. This a truly sporty-looking car of your own to drive...without the unreliability and waste of domestic automobile engineering.",3
1647,"I purchased this car and the next day at about 105 miles started a 450 mile trip. I was not expecting to get 19 MPG on hwy after reading on the Jeep website that you get 380 mile range per tank full. 210 miles into the trip on flat Southern Florida hwy, I had to stop for gas and every 210 to 230 miles thereafter for the rest of the trip and on the way back. Yes A/C was on but 19 mpg. I love the car, the interior and exterior designs but I am very disappointed with the gas mileage. The mileage was a major factor in the purchase decision and I feel that I was lied to.",1
1648,"I have owned my 07 Prius for ten days. It is very easy to maneuver on road and parking lot. Turning corners is just a piece of cake. Ride is comfortable and quiet. Love the backup camera and it really works. Love to push a button to start the engine. I don't need to touch my key in order to get into the car, drive, park, and close the doors. The most interesting thing is watching the trip computer telling you engine running conditions and fuel economy. For the first tank of gas, I got 50 MPG (filled 9.0 gal at 450 miles) with 80% city miles. Very impressive! Very happy with my purchase.",3
1649,"We joined the ""buy American"" movement and purchased an Edge just after a good working over by the local Toyota dealer. Wow, I am impressed with the ease of maneuverability, the sound system, the sun roofs, and the seat's base-length- finally a seat that extends out far enough and doesn't cut off the circulation in one's legs. The second row seating is also unusually comfortable for this type car. Only had it a week, but so far, it's outstanding.",3
1650,"Traded out of a V6 Accord due to my long daily commute and gas prices. Got 37 MPG first tank - 80% highway. This is a nice little economy car that is well equipped and reasonably entertaining to drive. I am 6'2"" and could use a little more seat travel and the seats themselves won't be fun on long trips but that isn't what I bought the car for. The OEM Goodyear tires were ""squishy"" and didn't inspire confidence around corners or on the highway. I already swapped them out and am far more pleased with the replacements. My Accord had Michelin Pilot Exalto's and they served me well. The drive train is relatively refined and the 5 speed manual is less notchy than the 6 speed in my Accord.",3
1651,"I had the Equinox LS for the past four years and had no real complaints. I know I've only owned the Torrent for a few weeks and its new, however the ride, handling, and style is superior over the Equinox. I would have gone for the new Vue however the cost to lease is unreal. I agree 100% with a lot of the other writers on the quirks based on my experience with the Equinox, but the Torrent is such a better upgrade.",3
1652,This is a fun car! Just bought my 2008 HB I really like it. Although thought I would get better gas mileage. Great look and it provides the much needed space that smaller cars typically don't. Love it!!,3
1653,"Sold my 2k Celica and got an 07 TSX. Perfect transition. It's a bit larger with 4 doors, and has much more power. I actually use every feature it's got and it's awesome. I never need to take my phone out of my pocket or reach over for any controls. Everything can be controlled by either voice, steering wheel, or headunit. At first I thought the gearing was weird, but in the city it's perfect because you can do most of your driving in 3rd or 4th to reduce shifting. You don't need the iPod connector because it has an AUX jack standard. Seats heat up extremely fast.",3
1654,"Have had G since 10/07, a lot of little problems and some not so little. Speaker makes a ""pop"" noise when car engine turned on from battery on position; sunroof wouldn't stay closed, needed to have motor replaced; one of my windows wound not roll up via ""one touch"". Now the throttle when first started in the morning sounds as if car is going to die out. Apparently Infiniti has no fix for this yet, but there's a bulletin out on it. I also have performance tires & they're wearing out way to quick. Great looking & performing car but come close to warranty - trade in likely considered.",2
1655,"I have owned this car for little less than 6 months after acquiring it from a family relative. The car has treated me well so far through the later part of the winter, spring and now into summer. Gas mileage is decent, comfort is excellent, highway noise is minimal, drivetrain noise is minimal. I have an automatic which shifts smoothly for the most part but is jerky when under hard quick acceleration. The car is unfortunately terribly slow (even compared to my 94 VW GTI 2.0l). It keeps me out of trouble though. Handling is pretty good for stock suspension. And lastly the interior build is decent, the seats could use more support and better materials.",3
1656,"This is my first new car and I love it. I've had it for around three weeks and already have 1100 miles. The interior is very roomy, and being 6'4"" that is very important. The performance of the car is not great, but if you get the TRD performance exahust and the cold air intake, it really helps. The exterior design is amazing. When I'm stopped or just driving around I get people stopping and staring.",3
1657,"After researching and researching on which car I wanted, I chose the AURA. I was going to wait and get the Astra but it was just too good of a deal to pass up on the AURA. I have over 2000 miles so far and no problems. I drive mostly highway but I can average 26-29 mpg!",3
1658,"EPA 23 to 27? Was that measured while going straight down hill? Combined freeway and street driving is 19 mpg and that was with the cruise control while on the freeway. Hitting reset after tanking up then driving 10 miles in town displayed 15 MPG, about the same as my 4200 pound VW Vanagon and not even close to a 2001 C280 Mercedes 6 or a BMW 325 6 cyl, both German cars get from 25 to 34 mpg on the freeway. This reminds me, it did get 27 mpg on the freeway but that ended when the first hill was approached, then engine shifted and spun up to 5,000 rpm and the MPG display crashed to the low teens. Sorry Honda, but this is no gas miser, it guzzles!",1
1659,"I love the performance, handling and total driving experience. The better then expected fuel economy was a surprise. The super tight suspension and supreme handling keeps all four wheels firmly on the road. Its low end torque allows the car to jump off the line.",3
1660,For $48k it should come with a bigger engine. It'll go when pushed but it lags at first. Car handles like it were glued to the road while providing a level of comfort you would expect in a luxury car.,3
1661,"Use this car as my get to work car( 60 miles) and tight parking car. Have a Nissan Quest also. Have driven this car hard, and at 40,000 miles it is going great. I got it at a good price, just like my other Nissan. This car is designed to be left alone( except for fluid changes) for a long time. Oh, and if you lose a hubcap it will cost you over 60 dollars ( rip)!",3
1662,Soon after I got this car something inside the door panel started to rattle. Had to go to 3 different dealer to finally get one willing to take the door panel off to fix. Squeaks/rattle all over the car when driving on rough surface. Roof when stored in trunk squeaks like mad. Window squeaks when rolled all the way up where it hits the roof. Dealer would apply some lube which works for about a week then rattle/squeaks returns and becomes worse. Get real people with 400hp the acceleration isn't much faster than a V6 Toyota Camry with 270hp. It probably is not worth to endure the noisy tire and all the poor interior.,1
1663,"I just bought recently my 2008 Honda Civic LXi 1.8 just one week. The best qualities that I like on this car is fuel cunsumption, space, comfort, and the power of the engine is like 2.0 liter.",3
1664,"After driving the ford, chevy, and nissan, I knew that none had the feel and/or power the Tundra had. After driving GM products for the past few years I could see a huge difference. Comfort, road noise, and a soild feel coupled with enough towing to pull the house down is all I was looking for. The Tundra is over built and will problably last forever.",4
1665,"Purchased a 2007 model in Jan 08. The vehicle included most options, but the smaller 8 cyl. Sticker was $41k. Saw the 2008 in the dealership when in for first service in April, 08 Liked it because of enhanced features on most options. Thought I'd trade out and knew I'd get hammered on the trade. I didn't expect to get slaughtered. Dealer quoted me a trade value of $23,500, or 12,500 less than purchase price 3 months earlier, and was only willing to cut sticker price on 08 by $4,000. When people realize that these pigs not only guzzle gas, but they'll guzzle your equity, we wont be seeing many more.",0
1666,"Took Delivery at the end of February. My ONLY regret was not getting the Nav system w/back up camera (hubby still insists it wasn't necessary). I just enjoy driving this vehicle. Will probably buy it at the end of the lease. Surprised by the good service center. Routine work was done quickly, but they still loaned me a car for my convenience. When my mom lost her hearing aid, they took out the seats to search, and when they finished they told me there was no charge. I was shocked, and now my mom is planning to buy a car from them.",3
1667,"I wish it had come standard with the spoiler. Other than that, I love it. The back is very roomy and there is a lot of storage space!",3
1668,"Had the car over a month and it's been great. I have a S2000, my son have an Accord and my wife had a 1999 Mustang GT Convertible. We were looking for a Lexus GS to replace her Mustang until we looked at the CRV. The lack of power is way over blown unless you're drag racing. I think a lot of the critic comes from the high expectation of this being an Honda. Love the ride and the dash blue light background.",3
1669,"This vehicle has the power, looks, and performance under one roof for less then $18,000 (fully loaded). it feels great to drive it. It has a very good design. It is the least expensive AWD vehicle on the market. This car will be extremely popular in 2007.",4
1670,"I just picked up my fully loaded '08 diesel F-350 long bed dual rear wheel beauty one week ago and I have already gotten tons of compliments on it (at least one a day.) The power is amazing, the engine is deadly silent and it handles like a 1/2 ton! I plan to pull around 17,000#'s with a 5th wheel in the future, but for now it pulls around my 7,000# boat like it's not even there. The interior is by far the nicest I have ever seen in a truck. So nice that my wife even likes to ride in it! She has hated all of my other trucks and would only want to take her BMW until now.Thanks Ford!",4
1671,It's a jack of all trades vehicle. Plenty of room for the kids. Hauls all my stuff. Decent mileage for commuting. Has a somewhat bouncy ride but it's a truck and truth be told does ride better than most other trucks I have ridden in. Has really light and easy steering. Real easy to drive. The transmission is a dream. Smooth shifting and usually grabs just the right gear. You can slap the stick for quick acceleration. Tows my boat very easily.,4
1672,Nice room for the driver and passenger. Little storage in the trunk with the top down. Rides like a midsize touring suspension and sits down on the curves at 40-60 mph. Nice pickup with the 2.4L. Looks great- a real headturner!,3
1673,"Traded our 2002 Bean Outback. This one is a much better performer but the interior has been redesigned for the worse. Controls were moved around to accomodate the opt. Nav. screen (which should be mounted on the dash). Climate controls placed low behind gearshift, audio controls lowered. You used to be able to adjust with a glance, now you have to take your eyes off the road. No storage for cds or loose change. The ashtray barely holds a chapstick. Rear seats no longer fold truly flat. Parking brake lever intrudes on drivers right leg. Odometer/temp/etc multigauge is useless and annoying.",2
1674,"I love it. Drives awesome, looks even better. There's not a lot of them around where i live so its awesome being next to the tuner guys and give em hell. The ride is very smooth. Everything is straight forward. Fuel economy is something everyone seems to have an CON for but what do you expect out of an SUV with a corvette engine in it. Id recommend anyone that needs the room of the SUV but the fun of a sports car to buy it and never look back.",4
1675,"I recently purchased my Outlook in. I thought I was ahead of the game by purchasing an Outlook instead of the Toyota Sienna. My number one reason for purchasing the Outlook was the advertised fuel economy. I thought it was too good to be true and I was right. I have exactly 2,596 miles on the vehicle. I use the cruise control religously on the freeway with just myself in the vehicle going at the speed of 65mph and I can never get better than 20mpg. I also had the time to test the outlook driving in the city until I had to get gas with just myself in the vehicle at all times and the best mileage I got was 13 mpg. I am so unhappy. Next time I will rent a car before I purchase.",1
1676,I have a knocking / rattle when I step on the gas when the car is cold. I have had my car in and out of Nissan service about 10 times at this point. I finally got them to admit that the noise exists. They have changed the heat shield but the noise still occurs. Nissan is telling me that this is normal and there is no piston skirts on 2.5 engines,1
1677,"Great car! I am a very frugal (okay, cheap) shopper who goes over everything with a fine tooth comb. This car is great. I owned a Geo Metro for 5 years and considered an Aveo. The Yaris is the best of the three with the most power performance, the most room, and the best at making me smile when I drive. IF I get rid of it before I retire, I'll looking to get another!",4
1678,"I recently went out and traded in my Trailblazer SS for a new Equinox and I am very impressed. The gas mileage in this thing is phenominal for an SUV (that's not a hybrid). I travel a lot for work so I have had many chances to get a feel for it and I really like it. My wife also likes it. The ride is very comfortable and is almost ideal for long trips. For those of you who like to ride high but also want good gas mileage and a comfortable ride, this is the one for you! I wish I would have got the AWD but my gas mileage would have suffered. Also 17"" rims are very nice a attractive!",3
1679,"I drive about 700 miles per week (practically all interstate), so I am loving the fuel economy. I went from an American mid-size car to this and really do not notice much difference in the comfort level. I have had this car about 3 weeks now and am getting around 35-37 mpg so far. That is enough savings to make 1/2 the payment!",3
1680,"I needed a car to commute to and from work. I decided on the Versa after carefully considering Sentra and Frontier. I drove each vehicle for a couple days and the choice was obvious after driving Versa. All the options and room of the more expensive Sentra, and nearly twice the gas mileage of Frontier. I'm getting 33 mpg and I'll be the first to admit I have a very heavy foot. Interior room is unbelievable. I'm 6'1"" 300 lbs and there's plenty of room to spare in the front and rear.",3
1681,I purchase this car and it has been ok at first but after I put a few miles on it it started to break down on me. Hyundai did take care of the towing and labor the first 2 times but refused the third time. I would not recommend the car.,1
1682,"I had abandoned Chevy in 2001, having back to back Nissans (Maxima & Altima) until 2008, when I was lured back to Chevy with heavy incentives. ""The Car You Can't Ignore"" ads were on every 5 minutes. The car was fun at first, but I swear it gets less responsive the more I drive it. Acceleration is reluctant, and steering is stiffer than when new. Just found out the steering gear is failing at only 16K miles. Rear seat doesn't latch properly, and if you stare at the sheet metal too hard, you can dent it with sheer will-power. (how did I get a door-ding on the roof?) No tactile response on the center stack; you have to take your eyes off the road to operate heater/radio. I tried, GM/Chevy......",1
1683,"The Torrent is a great little SUV for women. Enough space to carry just about anything, but handles like a compact, that fabulous Pontiac power steering and transmission. Pontiac is the true signature American car; sharp style at first glance, muscle when you need it, smooth ride, fun and always dependable. I have done weekend driving with the Murano and the Jeep Liberty and the Torrent beats both no contest. It has all the classic benefits of a Pontiac: fast start, stylish interior and exterior, affordable price (at $26,000 it is $12,000 cheaper than the Murano) and great on gas. I get 27 miles to the gallon, and it only takes $61.00 to fill up the tank. I love this car.",3
1684,"Excellent car! I have owned Toyotas and VWs previously. The car will put that 'GRIN"" on your face every drive. Engine goes like stink and car handles all too good for this price. Being 6'3 and 265 I am comfortable always. Looked at the new 3 Series first, smaller interior space and less HP. Mild winter so far here in upstate NY, anxiously waiting to test AWD. When will this ""GRIN"" go away? Sound system also plays all music types with excellent quality. Tough decision between engine sound or music! GRIN",3
1685,"This is my 2nd BMW 650i I had purchased 2/2/2007. I traded my 2006 650i coupe for a 2007 650i convertible. Since the sun roof did not slide back on the coupe I got the convertible instead. I am very happy and pleased with the convertible. This car has the perfect package: comfort, luxury, handling, performance, agility, and beauty inside & out. The color of mine is Alpine white with the new upgraded leather beige. Mine came fully equipped with all options except HD radio, which you cannot have if you have the real-time traffic for the navigation. This is an awesome feature to have. iDrive is not difficult to use, as long as you are willing to learn! People stop complaining!!",4
1686,I have been out of trucks for 10 years but found this one to be an excellent value. I really liked the design and feel when I drove it so I bought it as a way of getting back into trucks. It may seem like a base model in price but it definitely has the look and feel of a much bigger truck. Excellent value in a new truck.,4
1687,"Don't buy one at all! I have asthma, and the airflow system is so bad, that every time I pass a vehicle with a bad exhaust system, all that polluted air comes into my vehicle, and I get an attack. Whenever it rains or there is an ice-storm, the elements pile up inside the rim of the door jamb, and this increases the possibility of the vehicle rusting. It is a spacious vehicle, but I would never recommend anyone buy this model. The ABS system is horrible. Don't even think about braking! It was my first experience with such a system, and I had to go to the dealership about 3 times, before I realized that this is what I have to deal with until I sell this vehicle.",0
1688,I transport equine medical emergency cases pulling a large horse trailer and find the 4-Runner excellent in doing this job. With the 4x4 going out into the pastures is not a problem or worry (to date that is). The only thing I do not like is the location of the electric window switches - they should be located much higher to be easily accessible. Mileage is about 20hwy/17city. One other thing I don't like is the way the Toyota emblem looks. Overall this truck is great in the field and for evenings out on the town for dinner.,3
1689,"Bought truck new, after about 200 miles I started feeling a vibration in the whole truck. I took it back to the dealer and they told me they have had complaints with other 1500s, did not know how to fix the problem. Waiting for a response from Chrysler which has not come yet. very dissatisfied and sick",0
1690,"I am extremely happy with my FX35 and could not imagine driving another car or SUV period. I love the fact that I can take it anywhere or do anything and look good doing it. The woods to go camping one day, and to a show in town the next, I have found the perfect car for me.",4
1691,"Mountain driving with 26-27mpg. Smart AWD system works better than my Jeep's system. Comfortable heated leather seats and easy to use dashboard controls. Driver visibility and ride height higher than other SUVs. Could not justify the extra cost for the Toyota. Durability remains to be seen, for my Ford track record is not good. Good crash test results but not the best. Handles great in deep snow. Perfect for a family of 4 and winter gear in the back for a weekend in the mountains.",3
1692,"After having driven Volvos for 30 years, I decided I needed a change so purchased a Mercedes C300 Luxury 4matic after test driving a number of cars. The car is easy to drive and very easy to park. It holds the road well. The seats could be a little softer. The visibility during the day is excellent. I purchased the Premium 1 package. The rain sensing wipers as part of the package only work well when it is raining hard- a time when the regular wipers would provide the same performance. The auto-dimming rear view mirror blacks out almost completely when there is a car behind you- I find this extremely dangerous since one is not able to change lanes safely under the circumstances.",2
1693,I traded in my 2006 ML500 for this 2008ML550 because I wanted a few more options such as a hitch and backup camera. My 06ML was wonderful and I had no problems for the three years I owned it! My new 08ML550 is awesome! The extra 80 hp makes it even more powerful (ML500 was fast to me) and the gas mileage is about the same! How do they do that? The quality is top notch and this vehicle is so much fun to drive! Love it!,4
1694,"I've had my Prius for just over 3 months now. It's a great car! It's not going to win any races, but that's not why I bought it. It's does not handle like a BMW, but that's not why I bought it. It's comfortable for me to drive, I like the features (Bluetooth, nav + little extras you get) and it's great on gas mileage. It's not going to be for everyone, but it's the right car for me at this point in my life - just over 50! Want a practical car, the the Prius - but know the limitations before you buy - else you may be unhappy.",3
1695,"Purchased this vehicle after having owned an 01 Civic. I have not owned anything other than cars, this was very comfortable and roomy. The gas mileage so far in mostly highway driving is about 23 mpg, but I only have about 300 miles on it right now.",3
1696,"This is my second RX. Just traded in the '04 model and I'm blown away with all the upgrades. Clearly there were focus groups held and Toyota/Lexus listened! Better acceleration/power, better fuel economy, and all the right upgrades to the navigation system. I bought again based primarily on the RX's proven track record for reliability, no test drive, no haggling, and I was blown away when I sent to pick up the car. Everything on my wish list from the '04 was delivered.",4
1697,"1st new car for myself and love it. It looks rough and rugged. Body style and the ride is what hooked me along with the price. Smooth ride, nice radio, great sun roof. Plenty of room in the back for storage. Goes like butter on the beach.",4
1698,"Purchased in April 07, 3.0L Limited model with all options except Nav package. An exhaust manifold stud broke off in early 09, very lucky to find it on the garage floor! No mechanical problems with it so far at 38k. Brakes and tires will be replaced soon. I did buy an extended warranty for this vehicle, since my faith in Ford was not that good. They probably will never be able to match Honda, Toyota reliability/quality. Too bad. Interior quality like most US brands is poor, leather is paper thin and painted surfaces are not durable at all. Replaced battery with an Optima for security since my wife drives this car. If the powertrain lasts until 125k I will be very happy....",3
1699,Took delivery early April. Have driven about 1600 miles already. Average mpg 23-24. Very lively and comfortable to drive. Like the dash layout and the feel. Nav system limits operation to while stationary. Unable to tell if the outside review mirrors are heated? Front seats comfortable. Rear seat leg space tight. Front seat heaters do not turn off automatically!,3
1700,"Break-in miles finally past, now I'm able to use the full RPM range and push handling limits! So far, flawless. The G35S feels light and nimble. Steering is very direct and engine flexibility (low rev pull) is great. Interior noise level is low, what I expect for a luxury sports sedan. Only quibble is a noisier than normal clutch, or just needs a bit more insulation. Stock RE050A tires grip very well, although won't last with that 140 treadwear. Interior materials seem durable and well designed. Comprehensive options nav, prem, tech, esp liked the superb driver's seat bolster adjustments. Fuel economy could improve though.",3
1701,"The Escape Hybrid has surpassed my '71 Firebird as the coolest car I've ever owned. It's great to have the load capacity of an SUV on the same gas mileage as the Camry Hybrid. Driving this vehicle is a fun challenge - to see how efficient you can be! Technique definitely matters - no jackrabbit starts, coast as much as possible, avoid excessive speed and you'll see 32-33 mpg without a problem. I live in South FL and so far, no problems with the a/c on economy mode; car stays cool with the fan & recirc. air. I did a lot of research before buying. Settled on this vs. Camry Hybrid (equivalent in style & fuel economy) due to max. tax credit, lower price, better load capacity.",4
1702,This vehicle has all the room and very reponsive on take off and on the interstate. Around town it looks good and very simple to drive.,3
1703,"After Government rebate this car cost me $19,500. In return I received a car that is safe, comfortable, with very good handling and easy on the eye. I drive this car approx. 70% highway & 30% city and average 55 miles per gallon ( 50 in winter / 60 in spring & summer ). To get this mileage you MUST drive conservatively (Coast downhill, accelerate slowly and use the instant mileage feedback gauge provided in your display.) I've completely changed my driving habits from aggressive to granny overnight. As I watch all the SUVs pass me on the road I just think of my last fill up (61.5 mph). I drive 40 miles to work & back each day & save 1200.00 dollars a year compared to my previous car.LOVE IT!",4
1704,"I wanted an auto that my husband would hate! When we went in to pick up My new Element. He fell in love with it. I selected the Metallic Root Beer SC. What is so great, it accommodates tall people really well. He's 6' and my son is 6'4"" and there is head room to spare. Now this is what is really awesome, the base part of the Honda Element is about the same size as an compact car but the box design allows for more interior room and it fits in my garage easily. It maneuvers very well.",4
1705,"The Yaris has the looks and then some. For 106 hp, this car has pick up. I have gone 100 mph on it, and it feels very stable (except when there's a lot of wind the car feels like it's floating and not on the ground). Do not be scared to drive it on the highways. I have gone on multiple road trips with it and it is so much fun, especially driving through windy roads. I could not imagine driving any other car on highway 1 (of course except a Ferrari).",4
1706,If you're looking for a small car with good features and good gas mileage this is a good choice. Lots of room big trunk and fun to drive. If your looking for a pocket rocket shop else where. It does what it is supposed to at a good price. Would recommend.,3
1707,"I bought this car because of its low price, great warranty and looks. It has the alloy rims, spoiler, console option and power seat. Maroon color is nice and everyone loves it. Drives like an expensive car. It had 30k. Seat could use some lumbar support, after long drives my back hurts. I traded in my 2005 Chevy Malibu for the Taurus, no regrets so far!",4
1708,"Bought this 08 g6 back in sept, 2007. At about 9,000 miles the steering system broke and needed to be replaced. Then the brake rotors began to warp shortly afterwards. Service adviser told me that these are some of the common problems with the g6 and Pontiac has no plans to fix or remedy the problem. I traded in the g6 a few months ago for a Honda Civic. Thank you Honda. Buyer beware! Avoid the g6 at all costs!",0
1709,"I absolutely love this auto. Superior if not equal to the so called fancy imports. The interior design is flawless; inside and out. All of the outside and inside panels are a complete match,as a result of excellent quality from GM. I would take this car over an Accord or Camry any day.",4
1710,"From the moment I test drove this car till now I have loved every single moment. The acceleration is peppy for a 4 cylinder. The suspension is great, and the car feels really solid. I'm glad I spent the extra money for this car over the Astra.",4
1711,"I am coming off a Infiniti G35 Coupe. The Volvo is extremely well built. The car is ""tight' and it handles well. The best feature is the hard top convertible. In less than 30 seconds you go from coupe to convertible. Back seats are spacious for a 2 door car. Ample trunk space with top up, not bad with top down. No spare tire. No XM radio option. Standard radio is above average. Interior design is simple and clean.",3
1712,"I bought an HHR because I need a practical vehicle with good gas mileage. For those who like the '40s chopped top hot rod look, the HHR hits the mark and surely is set apart from its Asian counterparts. I see the hard surfaces in the interior as a virtue, since my kids always come back muddy from bicycle sports events and its durable as easy to clean for this purpose. I opted for the SS version that was engineered by GM Performance Division. It handles like a sports car and has the acceleration of a rocket. My experience with actual fuel mileage is about 27.5mpg for combined 70/30 hwy/city with the 2.0L Turbo. I'm very happy with my HHR SS and it fits my specific transportation needs well.",3
1713,"After a lot of research, I found that most cars simply do not accommodate tall guys like me. This one is S-W-E-E-T! I am absolutely thrilled with the vehicle. Utterly dependable, Highly ""customizeable""(new word for me there... lol). Mileage could be better, as this year has the aging Camry 2.4L. I am averaging about 34 mpg, with mixed cargo and passengers. This is the fourth Toyota I have bought, from the '76 Corolla, to my convertible '81 Corolla SR5 w/the 3tc. Kicking myself for ever selling that one, but the Scion more than soothes those old wounds. Summary: great head room, decent mileage, and always great to be the first on the block with a toy. Two BIG thumbs up!",4
1714,"I have owned a 2002 Jetta great car now I own a the best looking car on the road today . 2008 conv. Eos light blue, every one stares when I put the top down. It's so fun to drive I put 5000 miles on it the first month fast to watch out v-8s",4
1715,"I looked at this and the Frontier. While the Frontier would have been a good 3k cheaper, I like the Tacoma much more. There is nothing not to like. Drives like an SUV but I have a truck bed. Perfect combination.",4
1716,"I love this car! Plenty of power, great handling. Love the looks both inside and out. No problems, all maintenance has been very affordable, great dealer has been doing the maintenance for me. One flaw - very very very low quality plastics in the interior. The plastics scratch very very easily. In taking my laptop out of the passenger seat, it scratched the dash, also I've been putting my cell phone on the console near the power outlet and it too is scratched, just from being there. I'm hoping the company has a recall and they fix this - until then, it's the biggest bummer on such a FUN FUN FUN car!",3
1717,"This is a car that I purchased for my wife, who had been driving a 2002 Audi A6. I realize this car is smaller and not designed to compete with the A6 (even the older 2002 Audi A6), however, things that she and I both notice everytime we drive it on the highway is the wind noise emulating from the winshield. In snow (we have 4Matic) it doesn't handle like the Quatro A6 she'd grown to love...not even close...the back seat room is limited to children (no way 4 adults will be comfortable on a trip in this car. Lastly, the dash (she has the pop up nav screen version too) lacks style...it looks ""american,"" and is outclassed by the new Cadillac CTS that it competes with...that's a first!",1
1718,"We needed a utility vehicle, and the Fit is really great. The seats that fold up are great for transporting our dog while the seats that fold down really help in carrying larger loads. The fuel economy is great. I drive only short distances to work and school, but it also does really well on the highway. I haven't taken it above 65, however. Not sure what it would do at faster speeds. The style is also great. I got a black one, and people really say it is a sharp car. I recommend the Fit highly.",4
1719,"This is an excellent choice if you're looking for flexibility. The interior volume and configuration options are excellent. Very quiet interior. Smooth driver due to long wheelbase, yet still has a tight turning radius. Drives like a car, with the space of a wagon, and the size and capability of a larger SUV.",4
1720,"2007 with Option 2, aftermarket leather seats installed by dealer. Car drives extremely well. Absolutely no problems. Acceleration more than adequate getting on Northern California freeways. Love the direct input to stereo system. Climate control very well done. Purchased aftermarket leather supplied by dealer - much better than Toyota leather and did not have to buy Option 6 to get leather. Bought the Prius for my commute (48 miles each way) but my wife commandeered it for her commute (20 miles each way heavy city driving). I have a 2001 Accord V-6 and plan to trade it in and buy my own Prius.",4
1721,"Had a Mercedes ML500 that was dead in the garage 3 times with only 23000 miles on it. Had to change cars. I had Infinitis before and they were all great, never any problems and great dealer service. This g35x is the best one yet. I love driving it and it has so many great tech items on the car.",4
1722,"I've owned this jeep 3 months and in the past month have had nothing but problems with it. The fan belt has come off 4 times. The dealership had to replace the motor at 1664 miles, put on a new alternator at 1700 miles and it has been in the shop for a week this time waiting for a new power steering pump. Every time I drive it in snow deeper than 6/8 inches deep the fan belt comes off which then causes the power steering fluid to spray all over the engine compartment. Now when I use the heater I have to open a window to get rid of the burnt power steering fluid smell so it doesn't make me sick. I haven't even taken it 4 wheeling yet. These are definitly not the Jeeps they used to be. Don't buy one.",0
1723,"I've only had this car for three weeks but so far I am very pleased. It has a really smooth ride and is surprisingly roomy. I like the quality and simplicity of the interior, and for 150 hp, it's got quite a bit of pep. The only problem so far is that the remote trunk release has been temperamental in this freezing northeast weather.",3
1724,"Before buying my civic (Jun 6,08) I drove the Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla. The Corolla was a good and I would have bought one but having two other Hondas (97 Odyssey & 97 Civic, both still going strong) it was hard to leave a good thing. My compromise was I couldn't get stability control but buying it with the Corolla would have meant having other options I didn't want. I went with the LX over the EX because I didn't want the sunroof or 5-spoke alloy wheels (just didn't like the look). However, Honda has a 15', 7-spoke wheel that is nice. I bought them and a trunk liner from College Hills Honda (on-line) for about one-half the cost my local dealer wanted.",3
1725,"I've never driven an older Escape, but I have heard wonderful things about them. I loved this the moment I sat in the driver's seat. I was concerned about the gas mileage on the V6 AWD, but it's not too horrible. I wonder why they still have this old 4 speed transmission? That is one of the few downfalls. I have all the goodies, including XM and sunroof, but the standard stereo is absolutely awful! I knew Ford's stereos were always poor, but they should realize that many people make a huge buying decision in the stereo. I went from a newer VDub, so maybe I am just being a snob on the stereo aspect.",3
1726,"I downsized from a '06 Audi A4 to a Civic. This car has been nothing but problems. When I bought the car, part of the bumper was scratched and the dealer fixed it. Then my struts were making a creaking noises within weeks of buying the car, the dealer replaced the struts. I complained a couple of times about the air smelling horrible when the A/C was on and they couldn't fix it (they couldn't smell it). The car started to make a ticking noise within the past week and took it into a dealer close to my work. With 31k on the car, the dealer is telling me that I have burned out the clutch and I have to pay $500 for a new clutch! This is a junk car and would not recommend this car.",0
1727,"I had a budget up to 50 thousand and was looking at lexus and infiniti. Then decided to test drive tl-s and realized that it is the best car for my needs. It was one of the most quiet and comfortable cars, with enough power for daily commutes. The car is built with amazing quality in all the details inside/out. Fuel economy is decent - after 1400 miles computer shows 20 MPG with average speed 29 miles. I anticipate expensive maintenance on this car - tires, brakes, etc.",3
1728,"Better to spend the same money on a used Nissan which would be far more fun and COMFORTABLE to drive. I regret the trade. This car is noisy, gutless and cheap.",1
1729,"Just picked up my new S40 yesterday and there is already a problem, albeit a minor one. The driver's side visor is falling out of its socket when you turn it to shield your face from the sun coming in from the driver's side window. Not something I would expect to find on a brand new entry-level luxury car. Still, the car is great and the 170 hp on the base engine is plenty. Features are well thought out and functional and ride is secure and supple. There could still be more/larger storage bins, which I hear they are taking care of with the 2008 models. Other craftmanship appears good to great. Hopefully the visor will be the only issue in a long, carefree life of the car",3
1730,"This is my first minivan, my previous car was a 2001 Lexus gs300. i am very pleased with this van, comfortable, quiet, great ride, even quieter and tighter than the gs300, but that is to be expected. The engine is not as silky as the gs300 which personally is probably the best 6 cyl engine in the world.",3
1731,"Easy to drive, firm on the road, no hassles in rain, snow or sun or even off-road. Nice lay-out inside and I get comments from strangers about its looks!",3
1732,"Even after 8 months I still can't really find anything that I don't love about this car. It's fast, and fun to drive while being economical and roomy. It's almost like being in a small suv size wise, but with the heart of a racer. All of my friends and family are impressed with it, and people in parking lots have stopped to ask me questions about it. My brother actually purchased his 2008 pearl white one yesterday. We now have a family of Mazda Speed3s.",4
1733,Had the car for almost a year now and I love it more now than when I bought it. It has the ride of a Town Car and the fuel mileage is great (26-31). I bought the premium sound system and several upgrades and haven't been disapointed one bit. It's a solid car and gives a lot of bang for the buck!,4
1734,"I practically live in my vehicle during the week as I drive quite a bit as a part of my job. Having driving a Honda Insight for a year and being very happy with its performance I looked a the Prius for better comfort and I must say I got it. While gas mileage is not as good (at about 53 avg) as the Insight (60.5 avg)I have been very pleased with the smooth and quiet ride. The many accessories like Blue Tooth for my cell phone, iPod speaker connnection, and excellent stereo system performance have met all my exacting expectations. The Touring Edition suspension and beefy tires have performed well for this tall car by keeping it flat when negotiating the tight turns on the roads I travel.",3
1735,"Bought this for my wife, she needed one last sports car before we she got ""old"". She had an old 1976 Porsche 911 but loves this car better, in fact she's says the TT is her best car ever. Bought a red color coupe and she loves it. It's perfect for her petite size and I know she loves getting all the attention. The handling is great, it wants to be driven and before she knows it the spolier pops up and she notices that she's going 80 miles plus. The trunk is big enough for a weekend trip. I'm just a bit too big for the seat which is too confining for me on a long drive but it's a her car and she loves it.. When Mama's happy everybody's happy.",4
1736,"This car is great. One of the best deals if your looking for something in the 20-21k range. Very comfortable and very quiet ride. Suspension should be a little titer on corners but other than that, I love the car. Going on 4k miles now and have avg 24-25 consistently. Had one snow storm and the car didn't flinch once. The vdc works great and kept the car calm under snowy cornering. The seats fold flat down and make trips to lowes and hd a sinch. And u can hook up roof racks to the top with the pre-cut sockets on the rails.",4
1737,"Love the car and the way it handles in city and highway driving. It's fun and economical. The transmission takes a couple of drives to get use to how it shifts and the feel of the pedal, but once you drive it a little, it responds just fine.",3
1738,"I have owned many, and most recently test drove them all - G35, M35, 08 C- Class, TL, Audi A4 (2.0 & 3.2), A3 (3.2), Passat, A6, 530i (2005). Nothing even comes close to the feel of the BMW. If driving enjoyment is your top priority, this is your only choice (save the 5 series, but you'll spend a lot more). All are excellent cars, but the 335i has something extra that you have to drive to experience. No probs for me with the run flat tires",4
1739,"This is the best vehicle I have ever owned. My wife and I took it on a 300 mile road trip on the first weekend which included drive time in the Colorado Mountains and on the highway, and it performed wonderfully. Even with the mountain driving, and allowing my brother in-law to road test it with his lead foot we got 28.7 mpg on that first tank. We were in the midst of some kind of biker rally on this road trip, and there was a rock band playing at one of the stops. I saw them out of the window, but couldn't hear them, I rolled down the window and there was the loud noise. I felt like I was in a car commercial. Looks great, rides great, couldn't be happier.",4
1740,"From the outside, this car doesn't look much bigger than my 2005 Taurus, but specs say its 20"" longer. The trunk is massive -able to fit two bikes in there with extra room. Haven't tried to fit it into the garage yet! Kudos for the 6spd transmission. It shift just where it ought to shift and still provides an avg 24mpg on the big 6-cyl motor (Highway I'm showing 28mpg!). Radio sounds nice and is easy to operate. Sunroof is well-designed with pop-up to reduce wind noise. I'm two weeks into this car and am very impressed. Just wish they'd made the ""ink blue"" color a tish lighter; it seems, from a distance, to be black. Will follow-up at six months.",3
1741,"Fourth Chrysler product. Intrepid, 300M Pacifica and now the Grand Caravan. Only the 300M was better, as it is a car and meant for comfort and style. Grand Caravan is a joy to drive. Backup camera, ambiant lighting, all interior doors side lighting and stow and go are great features. CD/radio great sound and easy to download CDs. Did not get video system, no small children anymore. Bluetooth makes cell phone calling and answering easy and you do not have to hold a phone in your hand, thus driving safely. Fantastic vehicle",4
1742,"I just purchased this SUV after looking at, reading about and test driving almost every small SUV out here.This is one of the sharpest ones, inside and out, on the market. It has every standard feature you would need and the dash is black and shiny and looks really expensive. The interior design altogether is just beautiful. Great job Mazda!!",4
1743,"I am willing to bet that at 31, I am the youngest person to write a review on this car! LoL! My last vehicle was a Volvo S70, so don't think I am someone who blindly loves GM. When I heard Buick was #1 in reliability from JD Powers, I decided to check them out. It had everytihng I wanted; pleanty of options, under 25k, excellent record of reliability, V6 power, comfortable ride, etc. I was acutally looking at Volvo S40s and Audi A3s, but stopped by the Buick dealer on whim. Overall, the Buick had more HP and standard options than the others, but most importantly, it has a much better warranty! I liked the fact that Buick stands by their product for 100k miles! I am pleasently surprised!",3
1744,"Initially, I felt a bit cramped moving from an SUV to a car, but then I got used to it pretty fast. Overall, the car performs great and handles very well. The touch screen controls are great and give the car a new and modern look compared to the competition (i.e Infiniti has an analog clock, BMW has late 80s LED displays and a confusing controller). The exterior design is awesome, but the rear does need some improvement to look a bit sportier. Overall, was very reliable. Since mine was a demo, it was put through a lot of use and the only problem it has was with a faulty bluetooth module.",3
1745,"We didn't think about it until we decided we needed a roomy, sporty, sedan-looking SUV/crossover with superb safety features, incl AWD (Seattle) and actually test-drove it. This car has all those things and what a joy to drive! Although you do hear some engine and wind in the cabin, but some, and you can't hear the traffic/road noise. Amazing brakes/acceleration! Roomy enough, although the back seats are not as comfy as the front. Nice styling; interior could use better materials. Test-drive it! Not sure if people who complain test-drove it first, knew of mpg. Rav4=cavernous/dark/plastic;CRV=underpowered; Forester=comfy back seats, as much room; uncomfortable front; sluggish as the Rogue",3
1746,"Originally I set out to buy an loaded LTZ with a bench seat, BOSE sound system and sunroof in mocha brown. But after taking the SS model for a spin, just to see what it could do, I was sold. Before purchasing this car I did test drive other sport sedans, all of them costing much more $$, and nothing was funner to drive than the Impala SS! The Jewel (dark cherry) monochromatic, red compliments the car and is worth the extra cost. I added low profile tires & wheels and tinted the windows all around. It's a good looking car and inexpensive to decorate.",3
1747,"After getting past the 4 door aspect, and taking it for a test drive I actually fell in love with the handling, comfort, and interior layout out. Dumb things made sense, and access and storage is everywhere. Leather stitched seats are wonderful, just right and high quality, something almost no one would ever have said about a Ford car in the past. Driving: Handling! Man with the sport package corners on rails, balanced, smooth, very quite interior, and just a blast on twisty roads. I will suggest this car to anyone for a test drive!",4
1748,"Being an engineer I way underestimated this vehicle. The better half primarily drives it but I look forward to the rare opportunity to ""steal"" it. Our location uses ethanol in the fuels. We are now at around 10,000 miles and getting around 29 MPG (note using Mobil1 synthetic oil). I think it was a little lower when it was new. The hybrid system is seamless and a pleasure to drive. The seats and controls are well positioned thus comfortable to operate. Handles great and is comforting to know every time you hit the brakes a great deal of energy goes back into the batteries.",3
1749,"The Freestyle was a practical choice because rebate plus 0.9% financing saved us thousands over the Odyssey or the Sienna and we got AWD to boot. Wasn't expecting a great car but that's what I got! Handles like a dream, smooth ride, hugs the road on curves, fun to drive. Lots of interior room: third row comfortable even with long legs. Getting 18-19 MPG in town and 24- 25 MPG on the road. Deep well in back gives lots of room for day to day cargo and adequate space for a week's worth of luggage for 6 of us. Has the best temp. control I have ever had in a car, both heat and AC. Set the temp you want and that's where it stays. Plenty of power for my needs, even up the mountains of central PA.",3
1750,"I just replaced my '03 V8 4Runner Limited with an '08 Highlander Limited AWD. Smooth engine, great design; a lot more family features and creature comforts than the 4Runner. Very comfortable, steering and accelerator are softer than 4Runner, brakes are tighter. Nearly same storage capacity; rides more like a car. Worried about the beautifully shaped sheet metal doors in parking lots. Wheels are 19- inch; tires will be expensive to replace. Captains chairs in second row are neat; third row stows flat--don't even know it's there. Keyless entry/start/stop is awesome. The vehicle feels well made with heavy doors, plenty of safety features. Also tested '09 RAV4, which is a great little brother...",3
1751,"My last car was a Hyundai Accent, so my Civic was quite a step up. I love my car. That said, there have been a few problems. The mileage was initially appalling. Used to getting 42mpg from a car only supposed to get 37, I thought the Civic would at least match it. After starting at 29, it was a slow climb to the lower thirties for 50/50 highway/city driving. I'm currently faring much better - sometimes 40 mpg highway. Mixed driving around 35-37, suburban/highway. Some trouble starting occasionally last winter. Dealer said it was normal for a Civic. The 100,000 mile Hyundai did better, so I found that a bit scary - or flat untrue.",2
1752,"Got 1400 miles so far, took on 800 mile trip, great ride,very quiet on the road. A little disappointed in the fuel mileage, 21 tops on road.",3
1753,"This is my second Hyundai, we also own a 2002 Sonata with 96K miles. I have nothing but good things to say about Hyundai. Great value and exceptional warranty. We test drove the Odyssey and Entourage. I honestly thought the Entourage was more refined and better handling. The Entourage is also very well powered, it jumps takes right off and does well on highway passing. The saftey features can't be beat. I have 2 sons and a baby on the way, this van is the safest on the market. The value and saftey cannot be beat. We picked the GLS since we don't need the fancy features. With rebates and loyatly owner incentives, I was able to get my Entourage for under 22K out the door.",4
1754,"This car rocks. Great handling, smooth ride, quiet interior. Awesome sound system. Heated seats, OnStar and the list just keeps going. This is the car has it all for the right price. The car is fun to drive and a comfort to sit in. Make this car one to check out when looking for a new car.",4
1755,"I am used to driving big trucks, but in order to economize I was on a search for a smaller car that had personality. Was I in for a big surprise, the vehicle feels big inside with plenty of headroom and elbow room to spare (I'm 6'0' and about 200 LBS) interior has really good fit and finish although the materials can be a little better, it has plenty of storage space with many hidden compartments. Engine performance impressed me because it does not feel like the if the vehicle is coming apart on hard acceleration, handling and braking are both top notch and they work hand in hand with the engine power. I drove the 2.2L and 2.4L engine's but I will definetly suggest upgrading to the SS.",3
1756,"I purchased a 2008 Colorado 2wd regular cab 4 cyl. 5 speed about two months ago. It is Victory Red with fog lights, aluminum wheels, and monochromatic front and rear bumpers. So far, I am very pleased with this truck. The 4 cyl 5 speed combo is fun to drive and has plenty of power even with the a/c on. I am getting 26-27 mpg on the highway and about 21 in the city. Also, the 4 cyl. is fairly quiet and idles smoothly compared to other 4 cyl. engines I have owned or have ridden in. After nearly 2,000 miles, the only changes I would make are: a little more lumbar support in the seats with reclining seatbacks on the models with the LS trim. As far as ride, it's much quieter than my '04 Silverado",3
1757,"I can't really say anything bad about this car other than I find it really boring. I had a Honda CRX for 21 years before buying the Prius. I loved my CRX but find this car just a nice car. When people ask how I like it all I can say is it gets great mileage and is a nice care. I plan on selling it and buying a Civic, Fit or Yaris. At least I will not be losing any money as I can sell it for at least what I bought if for.",2
1758,"I bought this car two weeks ago. I have enjoyed every second I drive in it. I love that you're in a compact car but you sit high like you're in an SUV. Great pick up and quick slow down. Get lots of curious looks in the car, people not knowing what in the world it is. I absolutely love it.",4
1759,"I bought this car to replace my SUV. After attaining 41 mpg at 70+ mph, I'm finding fewer reasons to use the SUV. I don't feel underpowered when merging into traffic. The ride is more nimble and sporty than the SUV. The cabin is quiet enough, given the aerodynamic styling. Although the seats could be more comfortable and the stereo more powerful, I remind myself that I bought a low-priced car for great mileage. I bought a Honda, not a Lexus.",3
1760,"Good car, drives nice and fits anywhere. very convenient. Needs passenger mirror and armrest but other than that has been a good car. I have only had it for 8 months. I have put lots of miles on it and has gotten good gas mileage.",3
1761,"This car is perfect for the young teenager. Safe, sporty, and super mpg. Price is reasonable and quality is great. First car or college car, Nissan Versa is a homerun with parents.",4
1762,"I've had my '08 Liberty for two months and I'm very pleased! I traded in an '04 Liberty for this more comfortable ride and more options. I have to say I pushed the '04 Liberty when it came to off-roading and it performed beyond my expectations - it hung in there with the Rubicons (!!). Now with the '08, so far my off- roading tests have been excellent experiences- and all the while offering more comfort. I like the reliability of Jeep - esp. with a long daily commute and the capability to off road/tackle snow. It's excellent! I haven't tested the hill descent control (yet), but will soon. I plan to upgrade the tires to gain more traction/trailer a sailboat/launch in slick conditions.",4
1763,"New truck, no problems, 5.3 is strong, shifts smooth, rides great, looks good. Very happy with the 2008 1500 LT1!",4
1764,"I have had many trucks, all brands, some have been better than others but this Tundra is the best one that I have ever had. It is so much fun to drive that I'm looking for reasons to go out! I bought a 2007 SR5 SB in Nov 07 and while it was OK, I really wanted the LB version without the Off-Road package. So I sold the SB with only 1389 miles and bought the SR5 LB and couldn't be happier. It rides smooth, has unbelieveable power, and gets decent mileage. I have installed a back-up camera, fog lights, self-dimming mirror, in-channel visors, sill protectors, duals and bed extender all OEM and the great thing is that it was already prewired for all the electrical installations. I love this!",4
1765,"I wanted a sporty vehicle that was much quieter than my 2005 Celica but just as fun to drive; the TSX delivers that, along with the leather package, 6-speed ultrasmooth gearbox, sunroof, bluetooth, premium sound package, and good mileage to boot. Only downsides - premium fuel, just like any performance engine, and the 2.4L inline 4 loses a bit of its punch with the AC running, but compensates at higher RPM. My '07 TSX is not quite broken in yet at 8650 miles - I view the 10K mark as the adequate set-in to allow me to really punch it (right after oil change #2). I'm looking forward to that day!!!",3
1766,"It's hard to find fault with this one. It's stylish, has unique bells and whistles and performs while providing utility and comfort. BMW truly is the ultimate driving experience. It far surpasses the Mercedes sports sedan I traded for it. The only other vehicle I've owned that compares to it is the BMW 5 series I once had.",3
1767,Purchased a Salsa Red Astra XR w/ auto and stabilitrak and am loving it. The handling is sharp but not uncomfortable over broken pavement on my commute to work. The Saturn car buying experience also made it so easy to purchase. The interior is extremely pleasing with the data information center and high quality materials throughout. I considered buying a Mazda 3 as well but I felt the Astra's interior beat it while being just as fun to drive. The main improvements I would suggest would be a little more power and more storage inside. I would have never considered a Saturn before the Astra but I'm glad I gave it a chance.,3
1768,"I've been researching replacement vehilces for my '01 Ford Escape for ~1- year, on-off. When the Saturn Vue came out a few months back I took a first test-drive in an XE 3.5 AWD. It felt good and was adquately powered, but wanted to test-drive the XR, but didn't get a chance to. Waited until the Red Line's started showing-up and decided this was the one for me. Put down a little more to reduce the monthly- payment. Mine's Polar White, with the Ebony interior. Looks good, feels good to sit-in, and best of all it's a hoot to drive so far. The 6-speed transmission is silky-smooth, with a quiet V6 engine, and just enough rumble coming from the chromed tail-pipe tips, sounds great too.",3
1769,"We love this car. This is our 4th Subaru and the biggest they make; we have the WRX and the Baja, and this make a great safe and fun car.",4
1770,The SX4 is a good looking vehicle. Folks are always asking what it is. It's great fun to drive. It has plenty of room and space for groceries and trips to the garden center and the beach. It has excellent-fitting and good-looking interior trim. My first tank of gas averaged 31 mpg!,3
1771,The HHR has been a huge surprise. I paid 14k for a new 2008 ls. It is far suprior to other cars in its class when it comes to usablility and comfort. The most impressive part of this vehicle is how smooth and comfortable the ride is. I travel about 30k a year so I needed a vehicle that would get great gas mileage (i avg 33 on highway) and was comfortable enought to drive for 5 - 6 hours in. On top of that the storage area is awesome. Lots of space in the rear witha great changing configuration.,3
1772,"Braking noise & quirks have been completely resolved from earlier E models. In fact,braking is excellent in terms of both ""feel' & response at any speed including into curves. Steering has now a really nice degree of response at both high/low speed. Fit & finish just beautiful. Although car not broken in yet, I'm getting 10.8L/100km (about 27 mpg) highway without using cruise-control @ 120kph (75 mph). Extra power available through all speeds. Seat comfort very good. Paint & exterior fit integrity excellent. Quiet interior. Cargo area large & usable. Audio/phone/car computer controls on steering wheel easy to learn. Heat/cool systems accurate. 5 speed transmission nice. Road feel is there, but not harsh.",3
1773,"From the outside to the inside, the A6 has beautiful features. The interior is plush and comfortable. The seat positions take you from a sports car feel to an executive luxury car. The MMI & sound system is fantastic, but I'm disappointed that the iPod integration is not on voice activation. Took a few days to master, but once understood, the MMI is easy to operate.",3
1774,"Bought my '08 in mid December in NY and drove it home to South Texas as an early Christmas gift to myself! Great price (15k discount) and great car. Very solid machine and inspires confidence. Everything works as it should and I am very, very happpy with purchase. Average gas mileage on 1750 mile trip was 25.3 mpg, nearly all interstate. Make sure your bill of sale says new! I see some new ones for sale (by Chrysler dealers) as used, even with only 10 mi. on the odometer, to avoid the lifetime powertrain warranty to the original owner. Be careful!",3
1775,"My first Corvette was a 1957 that I sold in 1979 to buy my Home. I now have a new 2007 Coupe that was worth waiting for. It looks and drives just the way I want it to. Just enough power to get in trouble with. I drive the Corvette to work in good weather. It's the best feeling to drive a car that you love, even if it's just to work. Jay Leno said it best; ""if you don't like the interior, buy a nice Dinette set.""",3
1776,"I had the 2006 model, and just purchased the 2008 model with the sport package. This car is far better than any of its competitors, and comes with an abundance of standard features. The ride is sporty, yet comfortable. The interior is well appointed, and well thought out. The navigation system is by far the best and most sophisticated one out there, yet its very easy to use. You can talk to it via voice commands while driving (most competitors force you to type in directions while in park). Buy one, you wont regret it!",4
1777,"I love my Nissan!! This car drives great and has SO much head and foot room!! It has plenty of cup holders and gets great gas mileage. I also love how sleek it looks on the outside!!! I have had some problems with it however. My starter is going out for the 2nd time, I have had to have my fuel pump changed already, and I am always having hubcaps fall off? about 7 so far. Thank goodness for my warranty!! Other than that though I love my car. It is so relaxing and comfortable to drive. The trunk has plenty of room also. My dealership has been the best I have ever had. They have been extremely friendly and has work well with me.",4
1778,"To Whom It May Concern: RE: 2008 Ford F150 Supercrew (Vibration start at 55/60 mph) We purchased this truck February 17, 2009 without a test drive.

1780,"Loved the original MINI but was too young to drive one. What a great car. So glad they brought the marque back. It is a superb car, performance, handling, comfort. Ordered my ""S"" kinda bare bones, sport suspension, limited slip, and better sound system. It has alot of high tech items in what seems like a low tech car. Great A/C even in the Florida heat. Surprising good.",3
1781,"I just got my GXP. WOW. My son has a BMW 325ci and now all he wants to drive is my American muscle V8. Front Wheel drive is cool in a V8. The torque steer is kinda weird but it is great is the rain and snow. I have been looking for a new car for several years but the GTO was not up to par, the Charger is no fun to drive, the 3 series BMW is too small, and the 5 series and Lexus are too expensive and this car competes with them rather handsomely.",3
1782,"Love the car. Sexy style, fun to drive, hot sound system, what's not to like? If you are thinking about getting one just do it! I am 6 feet tall and there's enough room.",4
1783,"I have been researching this purchase for over a year now, ever since I found out they were redesigning the G35. I was not impressed with the previous version's interior design or quality, but this redesign is incredible!! I am a package kinda guy, meaning I like both interior and exterior refinement and the folks at Infiniti have got it right... and it blows the BMW 3 Series to the side of the road. The get-up-and-go of this car is great. The technology of the navigation system and audio systems is out of this world and the car just looks great! I compared to the Lexus IS350, BMW 335, Acura TL, Audi A4. This car is number one!",4

1786,"I traded a '07 Corvette - fully loaded, it was a great American car, but no comparison to my new SL 550. Performance, handling, quality interior and exterior are beyond my expectations. I have had many MB automobiles since my first 1988, this is by far the best.",4
1787,The driving experience has been wonderful. The vehicle holds to the road and basically drives itself. The sensors are an added feature that certainly gives a peace of mind related to safety.,4
1788,"This car is fun, fun, fun! I have only had it a week and I can't remember loving any car this much. After purchasing my new Eos I left the dealer with the top down (of course!). I only got about five miles before some guy drove up and yelled, ""Nice car!"" to me. My daughter is seriously impressed and she has a new BMW 3 series!",4
1789,"Coming from two BMW's (most recent being a newer model 7 series), I was going back and forth between the X5 and ML. I decided to go with the ML since the value was much greater and I like the ML design better. Also, the standard seats on the X5 were uncomfortable. Although I am accustomed to a smooth ride, I found the ML to drive very well especially considering it's an SUV. I also like how the transmission shifs so smooth. I bought the ML 350 with premium 2 pkg, parktronic, Ipod and running boards. Unlike the review from spicoli on 3/17/2008, I do have Xenon headlights, rain sensing, power tailgate, driver/passenger memory seats and rear climate control and many other cool features.",3
1790,"This is my second srx. Bought first in 2004 when it first appeared. Loved that one. But the 2008. Is much nice. Nicer interior, better ride, love the look.",3
1791,I finally convinced my reluctant wife to trade her 2005 Solara convertible for the EX35. I have an FX45 and tried to convince her that AWD was of more value than a convertible on which we have had the top down 3 time in the last year. Well the day after we picked it up we had an ice storm and now she is a believer. She loves the car and so do I. I'm trying to convince her to let me have the EX and she can drive my FX. So far no luck.,4
1792,"I guess I expect more for my money but this was a total rip off. A lifelong Chevy owner & family we purchased it in January 07. Since then, constant brake squeaking, steering column moaning and now the overhead compartment broke loose! After reading all these other problems people have had, I would not recommend this truck - with the price you pay, Chevy needs to learn to make a truck that doesn't fall apart. Seriously disappointed. The dealer has done all work on it and even they tell me Chevy knows that brakes are their #1 problem. Save your money - buy something else that's not in the shop every month! With domestic junk like this, no wonder GM is having a hard time.",0
1793,"Did some research on this truck and the ratings I read are true. My mpg on highway at 71 mph at 65 degrees, little wind, is around 19 mpg the truck had 65 miles on it. The V8 has some good power. Got the Laramie package with the trailer tow package. Truck pulls 3000 lbs real good. Love the black metal flake paint with the chrome front end looks like a Harley truck. Truck gets a lot of looks, Dodge did a good job on redesigning the front clip. Ride is pretty good for a pickup truck.",3
1794,"For the money, best value on the street. I am ex football player for the size of the car this vehicle is very comfortable. When we first purchased our Versa the brake lights kept blowing out every week, our interior cabin seems to be hot all of time. However fun car to drive, gas mileage gets better as it breaks in. Love the sound system, but they need to correct rear seat belt issue mine is so tight you can't slip your fingers between the belt and the rear back support portion of the seat. Remember this is a economy car, we are very Happy. Make it easier for us to work on the car Nissan, at least to change oil/filters and make a better key and hub caps the holders are plastic (Weak).",3
1795,"Trying to downsize from a minivan, my husband picked out this car. I did test drive the car, but what can you tell in 15 minutes? It is totally ergonomically incorrect for my size - 5'. If I ran the world, all cars would have adjustable pedals, as they are a godsend for short drivers. The telescoping steering wheel is not enough. The gas pedal is very stiff and is causing knee pain. The seating arrangement - you have to recline - also causes me back pain, even though the seats are nice and supportive. I am not looking forward to driving this car in the snow - too much zip and no all wheel drive. All that said, my husband loves the car. He is a normal size and loves racing.",2
1796,"Fully optioned: AWD, black with black, DI 300hp engine. MSRP is $48,090. Which btw u cannot properly configure on Edmunds as the options they list differ somewhat then what Caddy actually will do. Without question the car draws attention. Ride is smooth & very tight though w/18"" wheels expect to get plenty of road feel; which is a new experience with Caddy. I extensively test drove the BMW 5 & 3 series and this car matches them in >95% of handling characteristics. A- Trans is like silk. Extremely minor flaw in fit, but it would only be noticed by perfectionists :). Rides very quiet, except on hard accel where you hear it growl. Motortrend said motor is rough at idle, but mine is smooth",3
1797,"I love my new Focus. The ride is smooth and the leather smells heavenly every morning. After leaving a mid-size SUV I was afraid of missing the power and room but the Focus has ample power and tons of front leg room for me to reach out with my long legs. The trunk is very large and holds more than enough shopping and luggage for most. The back seat is small and would be good for small children. I am usually the only one in the car but the kids fit just fine when we get out together. I am thrilled with the 5 options for music. USB,MPG or I-pod, radio, 6 CD changer, and the best, Sirius. The car looks better tinted and I recommend purchasing aftermarket door edge gaurds. Happy trails!",4
1798,"We bought a van that the owner's wife of the dealership drove with aprox 6,000 miles on it. It has been in the shop for replacement sensor for the door, AC would shut off so they replaced internal thermostat, sensor that would tell us outside temp was replaced, front passenger seat belt unreliable and arm rest fell off and was replaced, 2 tires replaced and the icing on the cake we needed to replace the brakes at 22,000 miles.I was told by the dealer that they have been replacing alot of the breaks on this car. What really is disgusting is that they want you to pay to replace the crappy brakes that they put in. I am sorry to say that I will be buying my first foreign made car in the fall.",1
1799,"This is my dream car! I love it! The way it drives, the luxury feel to it, everything. This car has every bell and whistle I could ask for. The back cargo area is roomy and the rear seats fold down and back up easily. The steering collum has touch control for everything. Very deep, roomy consoles. We fit 6 large adults very comfortably with lots of room left. The driver assist backup camera is so helpful. I feel very safe and confident driving this SUV.",4
1800,"I have only put on 2100 miles and am pleased with how the vehicle runs and the fuel mileage. It is the basic lowest cost Cobalt XFE sedan with air and manual tranny. At 75mph average on the freeway, it will deliver 34 mpg +/- 3mpg depending on with the wind or against. Has turned in 39.7mpg on 160 mile trip driving at 60 mph on freeway. Vehicle was purchased as a run around unit with trips not longer than 3 hours thus comfort (i.e. as in our Town & Country Van) was not a priority. It has fairly predictable handling with a quiet ride and is not buzzy as was found with some small foreign vehicles in this size.",3
1801,"We currently own a 2004 Forester which my wife drives and loves. But the Forester is very noisy above 50 MPH. We bought a 2008 Legacy 2.5i Limited and I have driven it just under three hundred miles. The trip computer makes you very conscious of your gasoline consumption. I averaged 28.4 MPG on the first tankful. This was town and country mileage. The car is quiet and reassuringly rigid. Several people have complained about the sound system. Maybe I have tin ear but the system sounds just fine to me. As far as I am concerned, this is another outstanding car from Subaru.",3
1802,"I bought the Civic for my 80 mile round trip commute every day. It does the job very well but there have been a few issues that I didn't expect from a Honda (this is my first). The air conditioning failed (due to road debris?). Not covered by warranty for some reason. The tires wore out very fast and unevenly (upper rear control arms were replaced per tsb but not the tires). There were two recalls, one for rear bearings and the other for water pump pulley cracking. A rattle in the rear deck I fixed myself with foam rubber. Overall not bad, but more problems than I would expect from a new car. Still it is a competent commuter car and hasn't ever left me stranded.",2
1803,I am approaching my one year anniversary and love the car. I liked the interior of the luxury model so I bought it and the dealer installed a sports grille (the cost was nominal as the grilles are interchangable). I have had no problems at all. I have 4- matic and the car runs like a tank through the snow. The media center is easy to use and the premium sound is great. The Bluetooth was not compatible with my LG phone so had to buy a Motorola. The seats are comfortable and the MB Tek looks like real leather. A great car for the money.,4
1804,"Bought this Si about a week ago and have had a hard time leaving it parked. This car brought the biggest smile to my face that any car has given. Not only do you get amazing performance, but going down the highway I averaged 33 mpg. I haven't had it for very long, but this car is one of the best deals I have ever gotten on a car and it is by far the most fun I have had in one.",4
1805,"My 1st pt was a 2002 5 speed loved the car after 124,000 mi I felt I should get another. I have been to the dealer to many times. I bought a used 2008 with 12,000 mi. After 2 mo. And 3, ooo mi the car died on a 4 lane road. Alternator needed to be replaced. 2 moths later a wire came loose need to be replaced. Just picked it up from the dealership and now the speedometer is not working. Gotta go back again. I do not trust this car anymore. I loved the 2002. Hate this car. I am afraid to go on a long trip.",0
1806,This vehicle is superior in almost every way except for fuel economy. Operating cost for gas alone takes away the other cost savings of ownership.,3
1807,"I've wanted an SUV for a While, but never liked how they handled or the gas mileage. The Compass sits a little lower and drives more like a car (can take turns a little faster. It gets good mileage, but I didn't buy it for this. It has plenty of room and is lots of fun to drive. I notice people look at me a lot, I don't know if its just a brand new car (model too) or just that I'm a good looking guy. Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase and look forward to having it a very long time.",4
1808,I love my new VUE. I purchased it to get better gas mileage. I was driving a 03 Explorer that was getting 12mpg and with my VUE I am getting 22-25mpg and with the gas prices going so high I need it. It is a fun car to drive and it is very sharp looking. I love driving it.,4
1809,"I love my CX-9, which is why I am so disappointed in its reliability. I don't know what is going on, but my CX-9 has 4,000 miles and it is in the shop for the second time. The first time the transmission went completely out and had to be replaced with 350 miles. It is now in the shop again for a leak in the transfer casing. I am concerned about keeping it (a bought it because I need a reliable car for my commute to college) but I really love my CX-9.",1
1810,"Traded in a 2005 Chevy Malibu.Actually drove a Doge Ram reg cab(2007)this past May when my Malibu was in for warranty work at the Chevy dealer. Did NOT like it at first, drove the Ram for the day and walked away subconsciously impressed. I started looking at the Ram more and more. Then came the sale price, 10 grand in rebates, lifetime powertrain warranty to boot. Went to the dealer and took a close look, checked the quad cab out, and purchased the next day. And Lovin IT! Thanks to the NO pressure folks at Swift Dodge in Davis, CA. I actually left the lot on a Saturday evening to think about the purchase, NO hassles at all. Smooth transaction at the dealer, great dealer! AWJ",4
1811,"I bought this car about 18 months ago after owning a G35 2003 coupe. This car is more practical, comfortable, and downright faster than the last car. Infiniti really got this one right! The perfect blend of sport and luxury. I can drive the family on a road trip in comfort, do the daily commute to work, and tear up the road when I get the urge.",4
1812,Love my Honda Civic EX coupe 5 speed. This is the best Civic ever built. It beats all the competition. Honda legendary reliability. Gas mileage. I have been averaging about 35 mi/gal. Awesome. Fantastic styling. Best color is black. I love everything.,4
1813,"I'm really enjoying my 3500 Dually with the Resistol package. Read the manual, waited 1,000 to tow and it pulls my 3-horse 26 ft trailer like a dream. Tip out mirrors a must for towing. Exhaust break a little rough on the horses but it will whoa the truck down in a heartbeat. Only complaint so far is engine light goes on and off - apparently I don't drive it hard enough and the turbo is not able to work properly. Was told by the dealer to drive it like a race care - much to my wife's chagrin. Very comfortable. Ride a little stiff - it's a heavy duty truck so I expect that.",3
1814,"I'm 55 yrs old and this is my first ever convertible! So much fun, I don't know why it took me so long. I may have a park assist (back up alarm) added on to mine. There is somewhat of a blind spot.",3
1815,Bought my Colorado in jan 2009. Everyone says gm quality is as good as anyones. So figured id give them a chance. Fit and finish very poor. Orange Peel in paint. Motor knocks on startup. Constant brake problems. Lots of rattles. Terrible seats. Traded it in today for a Honda. Glad to see it go. I will never buy a gm car or truck again.,0
1816,"This is a great truck! It has, what seems like, unlimited power, pretty good gas mileage and outstanding creature comforts. The interior of the truck makes long drives easy; I wish I had this truck in college, it would have made the road trips even more exciting.",3
1817,"Traded in an '05 MDX, and after review & test drive of the new MDX and other ""premium"" CUVs, couldn't believe the value - I suppose maybe a few missing features? No compromise to the ride and handling, however, and great drivetrain with 6 spd manumatic. X5, ML, Audi, etc, have nothing on the CX-9 in terms of the way it drives. Also quiet and comfortable. Mileage is as advertised, not great, though on a recent trip got 18.5 mpg with car loaded down including rooftop luggage. Middle row seat is limousine-like. Only criticism is this is my 2nd Mazda (also a 2007 ""3"") with a vibrating LH mirror - Mazda can't fix them?? One unscheduled repair for a failed rear wheel bearing.",3
1818,"Looking at Consumer Reports, I was very concerned with the reliabilty of purchasing a MB as 2004-2006 quality rating were dismal. However, my wife always wanted a Benz and glad we did! Car rides and drives like a dream. Best brakes and overall very solid. It's been 18 months with +20k miles without any incident other than having the oil changed.",4
1819,"I just got my new Yaris today and I love it. It is taking me some time to get used to driving a new car, but it handles great. It excels much better than my old car, and very quickly for a 4 cylinder. I got the 4 door sedan. I didn't get any special features, just a radio/cd player, but it is better equipped than my old car. At this pricepoint, the payments are affordable on my part time college student income. I just can't say enough about my car.",4
1820,"This car is heaven on wheels. I have put 4,000 miles on the car so far with no problems. Now that I've passed the break in period, the car gets 23 MPG in mixed driving!! The car handles very well and the braking is fantastic. I had a 1997 BMW 528i and this new 528i is so much better in almost every department compared to my old one. I looked at the E60 when it came out in 2004, but I didn't like how they placed window switches and other little things. The 2008 refresh got it right and I love the improvements over the earlier E60s. Great car all around!",4
1821,"Was back and forth between Acura TL-S and Infiniti G35 and am so glad I went Infiniti. So much power, love the rear wheel drive, features galore and probably got a better deal than I would have on an Acura. Navigation is great, real time XM traffic will change the way you drive and the built in hard drive is a killer feature. The new styling and revamped interior really make the G35 standout among the competition. It's also nice to pull up next to Audi A4 owners and blow them off the line! Such a fun car, I still can't wait to get in and take off every day.",4
1822,"This is by far the best vehicle I have ever owened, very reliable, very economical, fun to drive. Very sharp looking car. Six star rating. I will be trading it in next year for a newer one. I like the way the 2010 models look.",4
1823,"Excellent acceleration and handling. I have owned a BMW 328i and the G35x handles much better. The AWD is not only helpful in snow/icy conditions,but it helps the automobiles handling altogether. Accident avoidance or just exciting aversive driving is a strong attribute. Slam on the breaks and you will not only achieve a sporty stop but the pre-crash seatbelts spring into action pulling you firmly into the seat. My G35x is a little over a year old and I have not experienced a single problem!",4
1824,"The new G35 is solid ride and very well built. I'm replacing a 2005 Acura TL which was a rattling piece of junk. There is a world of difference and not for much more money. The style exterior and interior is great much better than the previous G35. It's very, very fast and fun to drive. If you want one of these cars, get at least the premium and tech packages and the wood package is neat also. The seats are stiff and fairly average size - not made for a large person! It's simply a great value for the money and hopefully be great quality and a great alternative to Acura who I feel is slipping in quality.",4
1825,"This truck replaced a 1996 Ranger, and the difference between the two was like night and day. Very comfortable, well laid out interior, solid build (rattle free), and great looking - gets lots of admiring stares. I have so far driven this truck about 7800 miles and have no complaints about its ride or reliability. So far, I am getting about 18 mpg city and 22 hwy.",4
1826,"I just purchased the truck and have only been driving it for about two weeks. I love this truck. I have always liked Nissan Frontiers, found them to be very reliable. This truck is a winner. I do wish the arm rest was longer though and it got better gas mileage, but overall I'm very satisfied.",3
1827,"This is my 4th Mustang and first GT. I love the sound, though I wish the automatic shift was a lot firmer. Very difficult to squeal tires. I do have a nagging dash noise, the same problem I had in the 05 V6. The exterior styling is great and the new silver vapour paint looks amazing in the sunlight. Might get some tuning done for some better shifting performance. Gas mileage in the V6 was a little bit better, but then I didn't drive the V6 like I do this one.",3
1828,"I owned a 1990 2 wheel drive Toyota extra cab for 18 years. Best vehicle I ever owned. I sold it with over 300,000 miles on it. I wanted a 4 wheel drive new p/u. I love this pick up more than any vehicle I have ever owned or driven. It is a fast and good looking p/u. I love the stereo system/cd player. It has a lot of pick up and contrary to reports I've read my pick up is very quiet. I've had no problems at all in the 14 months I've owned it. Although the running boards look great, they are in the way trying to get into and out of the p/u. I would never own any other kind of mid- sized truck besides the Toyota. To me it is the best truck on the road. Bar none!",4
1829,I have only had my compass for 2 weeks and so far I love it.,3
1830,"This is my second Altima. My first was a 1995 that has almost 300,000 miles on it that I am keeping as a second car as it still runs great. How could I not by another Nissan? I love everything about this car. While I only have slightly less than 3000 miles on it I just got 34.5 mpg on a trip from Cincinnati to Memphis driving 70-80. Combined city/hwy I am averaging just under 30 mpg. To imagine getting this kind of mileage on a car of this size is hard to believe. My engine is hardly broken in! The styling is amazing and the interior is very spacious (I'm 6'2'). The CVT is awesome as is the keyless entry and trunk release. Push button start is great. Make this your next car!",4
1831,"Purchased in Feb. Terrific ride - very comfortable. The oversized sunroof is a real plus. Ordered Premium Package, rear side airbags, mats, heated front seats, metallic color. Nice ride: car performs beautifully. So far, shows I'm only getting 15.6 miles to gallon, although alot of street driving. No hesitation as mentioned in another post. Very powerful and sensitive brakes. This is a feature added as I read it's designed to perform right away. Very roomy although rear has hump in middle seat. The technology over just a few years ago is amazing. Had another customer in car wash actually strike up conversation about how nice the car is.",4
1832,"Great truck, have owned several full size Silverados and am very satisfied with Toyota Tacoma.",3
1833,"I wanted Toyota quality, what I got was Toyota cheap! This car has too much plastic (for example, its all along the sides below the door and quarter panels), too much emphasis on youth chic and not enough hallmark Toyota quality. No wonder they invented a new brand. The radio pops whenever you turn it on after a short delay because of poor integration of the factory amplifier option. This occurs on every Scion with a factory installed amp. When I first got it, the radio popped every time I changed stations! It also has cheap sheet metal that pops from the slightest pressure. I thought I was going to dent the hood, hatchback and doors a couple of times when I first waxed it. The whole roof is glass. On the plus side it is fun to drive.",1
1834,"Bought this to save on gas mileage, commuting 1 hour a day to work Hwy. I'm only getting 25 mph, sticker says 26-31 and am not happy. We planned on traveling and using luggage carrier ( we unfortunately discovered rails to hold carrier don""t come with car so you need to spend extra to buy that) but where to put carrier as radio antennae is on roof? I do like driving it tho, not sure if we will keep car tho with gas mileage poor.",1
1835,"This is the 4th Suburban that I've leased. Each one keeps getting better in terms of design, comfort, styling and performance. If it wasn't for teh Chevrolet emblem, you would think you were driving the Cadillac. I like the vehicle for its handling and performance. For a large vehicle, I find that it accelerates well for its size, and handles much like a sports car. The cargo space allows me to carry equipment for the various activities that I engage in, as well as having enough room and comfort for my passengers. Keep up the good work GM!!!!!",4
1836,"Traded an '03 Odyssey (which had problems). CRV isn't as plush as Odyssey but more fun to drive. Only 18-20 mpg city so far-will update later. Kids like having ""real"" doors with windows that go down (Odyssey didn't have and they suffered when the AC went out in June [in Texas!!] when van was only 3 yrs old). Love it so far!!",4
1837,"This is my first ever never used car. The fuel economy is spot on estimate during the summer months. Under estimate in winter (bear in mind fuel mixtures are different in winter). I do mostly 55mph+ driving, with city errands and cruising on the weekends. First and second gear have good power for its size. I'm always tearing up my tires. A lighter flywheel would make the shifting more responsive. After driving a series of beaters that lacked, power, heat, AC, floorboards and door windows that functioned, this little car is like a dream. Super quiet! I often have people ask me if it's on. Spacious. Handles wind shear well... ever driven a tiny Ford Festiva in the wind? HUGE difference!",4
1838,"I was in need of a 4 banger with good gas mileage. I'd settled on the Honda Civic when I saw the ratings on the Hyundai, read the reviews and checked out the warranty. For what I paid and how it is equipped I saved several thousand dollars over the Civic. I love the fact that it comes with standard XM radio, the interior room is great and the back seat feels like a full sized Ford.",3
1839,"I was ready to buy Accord, but felt I should at least drive an Altima. Wow. Internet pics dont do car justice. Very smooth, refined, and the cvt is so sweet and the sound system is solid. First tank of gas the mileage was not that good, mainly because of my desire to get the know the power of those 270 horses. 2nd tank of gas resulted in average of 26mpg -- which was 75% highway and 25% city. I know I am sacrificing 4-5mpg for v6 instead of v4, but I can live with it.",3
1840,"I have owned Subarus for several years, mostly WRXs. I finely decided to try a Legacy GT. I am really glad I did. It is a great car, having good power, and more luxury than the WRXs I owned. Subaru has done a great job on the entire design, and functionality of the Legacy GT. I have added a Stage one Cobb Accessport, and it changed an already good performing car into a really GREAT performing car. The added hp/torque from this programmer really changes the entire character of the engine, without cutting the mpg. It's the best $695.00 I ever spent!!",4
1841,"I wasn't even looking for an Escape when I started shopping and ending up there on chance because the Toyota dealer messed me over and I walked out. Anyway, I was surprised by the performance, look and feel of the 2007 Escape. It has been a great ride over the past year. The only thing I have noticed is breaking really hard is a little sluggish but over all a great ride. I am very happy with my 2007 Escape.",3
1842,"Overall, my experience with my new Vue is very positive. Although, I very seldom make a major purchase on impulse, this car was an exception. As soon as I saw it on the lot, I knew I had to have it. Over the last year or two, whenever a saw one of GM?s foreign competitors? crossover vehicles, I would think if GM (I?m a GM retiree) would make something like that I would buy it.",3
1843,"I just purchased by IS 250 two days ago and I love it. I traded an 07 Acura TL, but I drove the Mercedes C300, Audi A4 and VW Fahrenheit GLI. Glad I chose the IS 250 even though the horsepower is lacking and doesn't compare to the TL I had. I got an excellent deal on this car and the base model is loaded with everything I needed. I did get one with HID, 18"" tires and upgraded rims and a few other items. Drive it and you'll want one for sure!",4
1844,I owned my 2007 Mazdaspeed 3 GT for a total of 45 minutes before I was in a head on collision by a RAV-4 going eastbound on a westbound lane on a major highway. We were both going approximately 65 MPH in opposite directions before we collided. I cannot comment on the long term reliability of the vehicle or the MPG but I am alive today due to the solid construction and safety features of this vehicle. Unfortunately the person driving the RAV-4 that hit me was not as lucky. My hat is off to Mazda for building such a fantastic and secure vehicle.,3
1845,Well folks I was thinking if I could just get my wife to try another bland midsize car she would give in and let me get the Jeep. So off to the Saturn dealership we go and pick out an XR for road test. My wife drives and after a couple of miles I see a smile..she says your turn to drive. We switch and I quickly realize just how great this car really is. I can tell you with complete honesty that the XR is without a doubt the complete package. If you're looking for a no compromise sedan this is it.,4
1846,"This is my 2nd Nissan Frontier since their redesign in 2005 just turned my 3 yr lease and now I have the Red Pearl 2008 as loaded as it can come. It's a great midsize truck good for work or play. I used it for both work family and a little beach riding. I regularly max the 4.0 out highway driving daily in PA. It will max out right about 115, electronically limited at 4500 RPM top gear which is acceptable given that you're still going way too fast anyway.",3
1847,"After driving an 06 SL55 AMG I traded my fully optioned and modified 04 CLK55 AMG for this fully optioned car with the 030 Performance Package. I had it less than a month when it was totaled on 12/31/08. I am so impressed by this car I bought an 07 SL55 AMG with the 030 and all options after the insurance claims were settled. For comparison I tested the 09 Shelby GT500KR, 09 Chev Corvette Z06, 07 BMW 650i convt, 08 BMW 550 Sport and an 08 SL550 Sport. I even considered an 08 CLK63 Black Series. Personally, I think the SLs are great cars that can do everything very well. Although it is not as nimble as my previous 03 BMW M5 and 02 M3 its still my 1st choice. It's stablemate is a great 05 E55.",3
1848,"I'm just the opposite of the mid-life crisis guy. Traded my 2008 red Corvette for what has to be the best lux/sports auto available. This car is so so smooth & sleek with a superb build quality both inside and out. Strangers are complementing my new ride at every stop or so it seems. This is our third Benz (wife on her second one, my first) and by far the best vehicle. I tested Jag's XF, BMW's 535 (powerful), and the Lexus offerings. I fell in love with the E350. Sienna Black with Black/Beige leather and designo Burl Walnut trim.",3
1849,"Took a hit and traded in our 2004 Pilot, unfortunate timing to trade a larger SUV. Love the CR-V so far. Just did a 1000 mile trip (avg 27 mpg), XM radio got lots of use. Smooth ride, plenty of room for the kids and all our stuff. Slower pickup taking a little getting used too, but still a very peppy ride. Very happy with our choice, had to look long and hard for our favorite Taffeta White. Wish the front seats extended farther out for more support under the legs. Floor mats could be better quality, already matting and shedding a bit. Wish the back windows went all the way down, we didn't realize this until after purchase. Overall great vehicle, plan to drive for a long time.",3
1850,"The new G is fast, and handles great. The Sport model suspension is firm without being harsh, and the paddle shifters for the 5AT are excellent. Inside all of the amenities are within easy reach, and the layout (especially the gauges) is outstanding. Sport seats are comfortable, and hold you snugly through any maneuver :-) The trunk space is pretty limited, and the rear seats don't fold down :-(, so there's room for even large suitcases, but not wide items. Fuel economy is pretty dismal, but to be fair I drive it in manual shift mode all the time, and rarely shift up to 5th except on the highway. Great car, great price, I'm delighted.",3
1851,"Great mileage, easy handling, dash components within easy reach, tire pressure monitors a pain on real cold days - likely with any car with TPM systems. Why they left out an MP3 connector is beyond comprehension - otherwise a perfect car. Good height, visibility, what you want in a larger vehicle but with the great fuel economy .",3
1852,"The 2007 Passat Wagon replaced my V8 Touareg. The wagon offers more space and utility than my Touareg did, while providing a much better driving experience. I'm averaging 29 mpg combined and about 34 mph hwy...roughly double what I got in the Touareg. This also turns heads more than the Touareg did new. Any stigma my wife thought she'd feel with a wagon is absolutely gone. She loves the style and realizes it's a smarter purchase than another SUV would've been. This is an Audi / Mercedes / BMW quality vehicle at a Chevy price.",4
1853,"I have owned many Buicks but this will be the last. I`ve had nothing but trouble. Poor mileage 15-23, acclerator problems,power seat, steering noise, ext temp., worst of all it has left me setting 3 times with a no start, and had to be hauled in on a flatbed. This all has happened in only 4500 miles. I have lost all confidence in GM. I wish I had never traded. Had an 05 LaSabre that was a very good car. Got 23-30 for mileage with no problems, I wish I could say the same for the LuCerne.",0
1854,"Bought this brand new 07 silver CRV AWD EX . Very Fun to drive. Nice interior design. Very Nice exterior design. Previous car was 03 Accord LX and the CRV has a simlar engine layout. I do most of the minor maintenace myself so its not much of a change from doing maintenace on CRV compared to Accord. Its great they re- designed the way the oil filter is attached as compared to Accord, it is not horizontal, rather vertical, so no messy oil spilling out as much when removing the oil filter. Some say the 4 cylinder is low in power. I don't drive like a nascar driver , but on the freeways, I see no lack of power when power is needed.",3
1855,"This CX 9 is a replacement for my wife's 03 Highlander. We compared it to the 08 Highlander and the 08 Murano. When my wife first sat in the CX 9, we knew that we found her next SUV. We bought the GT, and even with the 20 inch wheels, it rides just fine with us. My BMW 540 with the Sports package rides firmer than this.",3
1856,"This Yukon replaced an 04 Tahoe w/ electrical issue. Love the comfort & interior space. Unfortunately we had it in the shop 7 times for 8 warranty issues in the 1st 6 mo. Now it's going through 6 quarts of oil in just 1,500 miles & I've had numerous other issues that were all warranty related. It's in the shop for no less than a week due to the oil issue which GM is aware of but as advised the dealer not to attempt repair. Luckily I have a good dealer they are trying to resolve the issue but have to tear apart the engine to do so. This all in 19 mo's of use. For the price it's not worth the frustration & days without it! Too bad b/c other than the warranty & oil issues I'd love it!",1
1857,I have drive my Altima Hybrid for about 2 months now. It performs superbly. Most of my driving is highway. I set the cruise at about 75 mph and I am averaging 35 mpg. I have every option and the car is exceeding all expectations. When you need to accelerate the gas engine is more than up to the task. I highly recommend this car.,4
1858,"Everything I expected, gets more comfortable with use. Fun to drive, lots of toys (nav) or just ""think"" in a quiet, smooth ride. Sporty to drive and comfortable on long drives.",3
1859,"The newly redesigned G37 improves in many places over the previous version and Infiniti is taking big steps to get up to the top levels of luxury and performance. The G is solid, well layed out controls and tons of tech gadgets that I still need to learn all of them.",3
1860,"Bought an Entourage to replace a 1999 Ford Windstar that died on us with only 99,000 miles. Entourage gets about the same gas mileage as our old Ford, but has tons more features for the money, smoother and quieter ride, handles much better too. Broke in the first 1200 miles on winding mountain roads and enjoyed every minute. Was looking at Toyotas but liked the warranty and the lower purchase price. Absolutely no problems to report.",4
1861,I have wanted a Lexus RX model for the longest time and I am happy to say I am not disappointed! This vehicle glides! It's sexy and at the same time a very practical vehicle! Comfort? I'm in heaven. I'm enjoying all the features too. There's no going back to any other vehicle. My husband is getting one next.,4
1862,"Until about 6 months ago, I would have said that I was very happy with my van. Now the slider doors are not closing properly (seems to be a common complaint), yet the service dept at our local dealership cannot find anything wrong. The biggest issue is the water leaking from the sunroof, dripping from the control panel(dome lights/door openers,etc. Also, water leaking from the dash when it rains, collecting water on the floor of the passenger side. There are tons of wires down there, so I can't imagine what kind of fun I have to look forward to. I am told that the warranty does not cover ""leaks"", I find it outrageous that Hyundai thinks that this is normal wear & tear.",1
1863,"I love my Yaris. I can't believe how much power this car has. It immediately gets up when I drive on the freeway and is truly amazing. This little vehicle has so much power!! It does have a little noise when I drive it, but that is one of the things I love about it. I feel like I am in a race. I nicknamed my Yaris, I call it a ""Bullet"" because it gets up and shoots out of nowhere. I am glad I purchased it before more people catch on how great this car really is.",4
1864,This north American Icon is truly the funnest vehicle I have ever driven. Excellent vehicle good fit and finish quiet interior.,4
1865,"I have been experiencing the same issue of bucking/thumping at or around 40mph. When lightly pressing the gas pedal the vehicle shakes or shudders but only around that speed. A senior tech witnessed the problem and said NIssan is working on it , but it had to get cleared by EPA. Not happy with this 08. Very disappointed in Nissan.",0
1866,"I, like everyone else, awaited my arrival of my Sky and was extremely pleased. However, I had 2846 miles and noticed a leak in the differential. Saturn assistance and roadside were awesome and had my car towed. I chose to have it taken to a dealer closer to where I live than where I bought it. Mistake. Leak fixed, but picked up my unwashed car, and 2 wks later still waiting to hear about another part that was supposed to be ordered for my sideview mirror that works sometimes. Other than that a great, awesome car!",2
1867,This is my first truck and I like it. So as for the mileage still trying to get a handle on it but it seems to be around 17 or 18 in town. I thought the 40/20/40 bench seat would be awful but it surprised me and makes you believe that you have bucket seats. Like the storage in the armrest. So far I am happy with it and it looks good.,3
1868,"I purchased the xD in March 2008, and have six months experience driving it. Fuel economy has been a steady 34 mpg, calculated. I have had only one incident where the Vehicle Stabilization Control system automatically worked its magic. It was during a highway run, climbing a hill during a rainstorm when traction was especially bad. The system kicked in at a time when I was unaware that I was losing traction. I maintained control with its aid, slowed down,and carried on with my trip all smoothly, safely done. This VSC is a worthwhile feature. One slight but nagging shortfall in the design of this car is the FEEL of the brakes-- they operate well, but are vague in their feel.",3
1869,"Having owned 2 different Lexus SUVs and liking them, I can honestly say that this MB GL 470 is by far the best vehicle I've owned. Just the right size for me. Not big, but roomy; not small, but manageable. It's a gorgeous vehicle, great sound system, incredible grade of leather, lacks nothing. Better on mileage than the Lexus GX I previously owned. It's solid and handsome. I travel to my son's home once a month, which is a 450 mile each way trip and I could not be more comfortable. I absolutely love this car. Cannot recommend it enough!",4
1870,This is the third Honda that I have owned and once again I was more than pleased with its performance. Driving a hybrid takes a little getting used in reference to how quiet it is but it handles just as well as my Accord did. I drive about 120 miles a day and have really noticed a savings in gas and time at the pump! If you are conscious of how you drive you can really get up to 50 mpg. This is the best car I have ever owned!!,4
1871,"Although I have only had this vehicle for a few weeks, I can say without a doubt that it is the most dynamic vehicle I have ever driven. The quality is outstanding. I love everything about it. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.",4
1872,Had an 02 and 05 X5 but needed something larger. Now have 3000 miles and no problems. Love the S-Line option but Audi takes 2 points off the residual value for leases which doesn't seem fair when you pay more.,3
1873,"1st off they don't have the right engine listed. I have the SXT Sport 2.0-Liter 4-Cylinder DOHC 16-Valve Dual VVT Engine. And I like the zip it has. I picked this up on May 17th after a week search to find the right color and options. I have the Sunburst Orange with matching colored seat inserts and dash. Also have a sunroof. I have a bad back and the front seats are great, very comfortable. Lots of room in front and back. Just as much cargo space as my Jeep Liberty had. I really love this car even thought I have taken some abuse by co-workers for getting the orange color. HAHA",3
1874,"I wasn't in the market for a new car until I was helping my sister buy her first new car and saw what a great deal the Focus was. I was able to get it for $13,200 out the door and loved everything about it. I had an 06 Corolla CE in manual and hated it. The quality of the Focus engine is well known (probably better than the Corolla) and so far the fuel economy is better. The Focus looks, runs, and drives better. I have to say I love this great American car.",4
1875,"This car does turn heads everywhere I go. Kids walking to school give me a thumbs up. People stop me to ask about the car... still! The handling in the mountains is awesome. It corners with plenty of power, no need to downshift with this machine.",4
1876,"I dont know what to say. After having a bad start with a 2008 Vue Hybrid I got myself into an Astra XR with Sport package (sport suspension, 17 inch alloys, performance steering, Stabilitrak) and let me tell you that in my life of 14 vehicles I have never been happier. That is of course once I bought the Astra arm rest /cup holder ($200 installed) and installed Sirius satellite radio. Test drove Mazda3, VW, and Matrix. This was the best. If you are in the market for the automatic, you may want to look elsewhere, they are draging down the ratings of this car. If your in the market for a five speed, reguardless of what you think of GM, take my word, try it out.",4
1877,"Rented this car while mine was in the shop for one week. Initial reaction. No low end torque (read: no get up and go)but nice and responsive when anywhere past 20Kmph. Quick sporty feel, handled well. Very pleasently surprised with this Ford product. Compared to a seven year old Civic it rattles far more when the stereo is turned up showing, to a degree, overall build quality. Very enjoyable drive and I will miss it although it would be in tough competition when I buy next.",3
1878,"This is a great vehicle to drive. It's fun and sporty, but also very safe and economic. Great job Volkswagen.",3
1879,Chose this vehicle over Tahoe and Jeep Commander. Plenty of room for six adults. Handles very well. Excellent fit and finish. Bought with the HEMI.,3
1880,"I never considered a Subaru until looking at all the others and not finding what I wanted. As soon as I sat in my LL Bean Forester I was hooked. Everything felt right. I love the AWD, the sunroof is amazing especially at night on our country roads with stars twinkling overhead, the heated seats are great, the wood accents on steering wheel and shifter make it look rich, and it handles like a dream. You'd never think this car is a 4 cyl as it has lots of power. Getting 26-28 MPG with just over 3500 miles on her. I'll never own anything else. My last car was a Jeep Grand Cherokee I had for fourteen years and I hope to have this one as long.",4
1881,"This is my second Titan. Lease trucks through business. First Titan was awesome as not one bit of trouble, trouble was couldn't keep out of it as I always loved driving it. Was never thinking of changing to another truck, but after rethinking the lease options again and seeing I was over mileage I looked at others, but kept coming back to Titan. Love the quality, performance and overall satisfaction of my older 2005 titan. This new one is awesome. Great performance. Great sound system and just a good truck. Have only had it a week, but can tell you the quality is there, and the service from our local dealership is great. I'm sure I'll have more to write but so far this is another great truck",3
1882,"Immediately drove 2 WD truck (17"" tires) to central OH from central FL - 20.2 mpg @ cruise set mostly 75 mph. Returned to FL w/bass boat in tow 15-17 mpg. Ride is super w/effortless handling. Plenty of power with 5.3 engine. I wanted a truck with car type ride. That's why I got 2 WD with 17"" rims.",3
1883,"After lots of research we purchased our Mazda5 08 Touring Automatic. We are so happy we decided on this car. This replaced my 96 Explorer. We have 2 young kids & they love it. The 2 folding seats in the back are perfect for any little friends we bring along & when not in use the back fits all my Costco groceries. Love the sliding doors, steering wheel radio controls, power locks/doors & sunroof. I drive a pretty even combo of city/hwy & got 25 mpg. It looks so sporty! It drives great & is really quick. I'm impressed with the engine I have no problem passing cars. Since going from a V8 I was little scared but for no reason. Great for the price, mpg & room! Go get one!",4
1884,"Got the 08 CX new as a Company Car Good: Very supportive seats. A lot of standard features for base model. Bad: Fuel mileage is horrible. I'm lucky to get 24 highway and avg 16 city. My Honda Odyssey gets better mileage and it is taller, heavier, and has more hp. Driver seat started squeaking at 20k miles-I only weigh 185lbs. Brakes went at 20k miles- almost all highway. I've never had brakes go anywhere near that quickly. Steering wheel made a clicking sound- several dealers couldn't find the problem. Left windshield wiper splashes water on right side and right wiper missed it. key fob died-even after repl. btry. A lot of minor annoying problems that were expensive and inconvenient to fix",1
1885,"This is an incredible car, granted it is expensive, but well worth every penny. I don't understand the complaints about gas mileage. With a little coaching from the onboard ""consumption"" feature in the navigation system I am routinely getting between 29 and 30 mpg. 24-26 is a high speed highway average, 28-30 around town, and 30-33 in stop and go driving.",3
1886,"I bought this car after coming back from Iraq. I test drove the g35x but I liked the ex better. I have almost 12,000 miles in the last 4 months. The car is quiet and has great acceleration. I have been pulled over more times for speeding by the police than I have in the last 10 years. The brakes are the best I have ever had in a car.",3
1887,"I saw in another review a claim of 27.6 MPG. I was also pleasantly surprised in this area. We have been as high as 27.9. We came out of an HHR and it took some getting used to, but this is a damn good buy. The price was very liveable, and we have not found any defect so far. It handles well for a van of any type and the ride is very smooth. Good power. I am waiting for winter to see what effects Traction control and Stabili-trac combined will provide. Overall, I think it is a well thought out vehicle",3
1888,"What a great little car, I have driven a hyundai accent hatchback since 2002 and this is soo much nicer, it is more comfortable, the mileage is better, it looks a whole lot cooler, the only thing that this doesn't have is all of the standard features, but overall I have no complaints.",3
1889,"I purchased the limited AWD, tried out all sorts of SUV. Warranty was part of the decision factor. For a 30,000 auto, you would think they would have put the lights to stay on after you turn off your key. Nope not there ( I was told it did but no it does not) Does not auto lock the doors after you reach the 12 or 15 miles an hour like most cars do. After reading the manual I find out that when you lock in AWD it turns off at 19 miles an hour. I could not believe it so I call Hyundai and they told me yes that it does. So what is the point in having AWD? I have had it 5 days now and ready to trade it in. Rides good except the back seat vibrates more than it should.",1
1890,"At first, after driving old school automatics and sticks, the torque converter type tranny was a bit to get used to. After driving the car awhile and learning the characteristics of the tranny, I have found that I can get really good fuel mileage and the smooth transition through the powerband is really impressive. Also, where I live it's very hilly, I'm talking 8-9% grades and the power is more than adequate and going downhill the tranny almost acts like a jake brake that the big rigs have. What road noise? awd is great for traction and handling. car looks like a ""mini magnum,"" really cool.",3
1891,Great mid-size with plenty of interior space.,3
1892,"This is by far the worst car I have ever owned. You would think BMW would notify their customers if they had an issue with the car. The fuel injectors and the fuel pump are constantly malfunctioning and every time I take it in, they tell me there is no issue. This is my first BMW and my last.",0
1893,I commute 60-70 miles/day. Never a problem. Fun to try to max out mpg using the display system. Very smooth ride. Feels like a more expensive car.,3
1894,"This is my 2nd vehicle from Honda first being an Odyssey, which was great except for the run flat tire issues. I sold my '07 X5 3.0 & leased this car and saving a lot of money on the monthly payment. Compared to the X5, the MDX is roomier, more high tech, better acceleration & breaking and priced well below the X5. However, there is no comparison when it comes to build quality and attention to details as the X5 wins hands down.",3
1895,"This is our first purchase of a minivan and we love it so far. We like the pickup, quiet acceleration and very smooth ride. These are the main reasons we chose this van over the Odyssey. Sienna is built very well, powerful engine, nice exterior styling, very good interiors, power tailgate.",4
1896,"Performance: The CVT engine is awesome. Its very smooth. You wont even feel it shift. For a 4 cylinder car, it has great acceleration and enough passing power for everyday driving needs. Comfort: pretty good. Nice solid seats. Fuel economy: not sure yet, since I only have 150 miles on it. I've driven 150 miles so far, and I have between 3/4 and 1/2 tanks left. Awesome! Fun to drive: goes with performance and comfort. Tight steering, I like it. Interior design: nice dash, very intuitive, tons of storage. Exterior design: nice look, somewhat sporty. Very large inside compared to what it looks like. Build quality: seems good. Still a new car right now. Reliability: same as build quality.",3
1897,"I spent many hours on the internet and many weeks preparing to buy this car. Our family has a minivan and needs an Accord but this car won me over big time. There are many practical reasons to get a Honda, but the C30 adds so much to my driving experience while maintaining a sense of class that it became a perfect fit. I am 40, but not ready to drive a 40 year old no matter how much ""sense"" it makes. The C30 has a simple but well built and easy to use interior. The exterior styling is very unique. The T5 mated to the MT is the way to go. Almost got the AT at wife's request but the MT was too fun to drive and brought the car to life even more. Chose the 2.0 for styling and audio reasons.",3
1898,"First of all, this is the best vehicle I have owned and my 7th Jeep. Some vehicles just ""fit"" and some don't. This really fits well. The engineers did well with seat comfort, equalizing armrest height and control placement to make for a great experience. The best news: It looks like a Jeep, it drives like a Jeep and it feels like a Jeep, not a Lexus and fortunately not Toyota. I love the Skyslider, mine is quiet because they performed the TSB and installed a new bow. The ESP is amazing. I live in snow country in western New York and I rarely use the 4WD since ESP and all-speed traction control are so effective. I hope the Jeep brand and feel aren't diluted in the future.",4
1899,"Love driving my Fit! It does fit anywhere, and is very comfortable inside. I have two six foot sons, and they say there is enough room. I took four basketball players to a funeral and they all fit!",4
1900,"Great SUV! Very smooth drive, handles very well on curves. Great turning radius. Good power, not great, but good. Very spacious second row, third row is not bad at all.",3
1901,"I had an 03 Murano before this vehicle and I have to say that this is quite a better vehicle than the Murano. From the looks, to the performance, to the saftey features, this is one of the best SUVs out there. Roomy cabin makes it easy to deal with children in car seats. Plenty of room for large adults (vertically and horizontally!). Outstanding vehicle, outstanding value.",4
1902,"I also have an 02 Wrangler and love to drive it. I wanted my wife and kids to enjoy the Jeep experience, but with limited room, it was terrible for the ones in the back. I also couldn't carry any gear in the 8 inch trunk. When I saw the 4 door, I knew I had to have it. It has tons of room for cargo. Now we can all go camping, hiking, trail riding in comfort and it is a blast!",4
1903,"Just bought this car for gas mileage. Went with the more stylish S. Bought the 5M to make it more interesting to drive. Not going to dazzle your socks off but is going to be a very able performer. Comfortable for the daily commute. Has enough creature comforts to stave off the want of a higher end vehicle. Love the gas mileage, only having to fill up every two weeks. Toyota Loyalist.",4
1904,"This fun to drive vehicle has a solid, sturdy feel that is equally good to drive in the city or at high speeds on the open road. It has great forward vision, seat comfort, trustworthy brakes, quick handling, little body lean, a good ride, it's versatile, has a neat AWD set up, and we feel safe in it with all of the air bags.",3
1905,"Just bought the 2WD Limited edition. Took it for a test drive before buying but I didn't notice the poorly designed inside door handles. It seems when you try and use the electric window switches the handle gets in the way. Try it you'll see what I mean. I have a 2003 Highlander and it rides better then this 2008. This 2008 rides more like a truck with the 19"" wheels. All in all I think it's one of the best out there. They just have to twik it a bit. Also, it's bigger than my 2003 which I think I like, I'll have to get use to it.",3
1906,I just got my tC three days ago and really like driving the car. We have a Toyota Sienna as the family car and wanted a small sports car to drive when only one or two of us are going out. I do not think you can beat the tC for value. It has great equipment and is very solid. My sons are over six feet tall and find it very comfortable. There is no sports car with as much leg room in the back seat.,4
1907,"I am very happy with this Arcadia. It has a great ride, nice looks and is fun to drive. It gets decent gas mileage for its size. The interior seem to be of high quality. I have had it for two weeks and every day I like it more and more .",3
1908,"Great super car! I have owned 2 Porsches, 2 Caddys, 6 Marks, 1 Infinity, 6 Vettes and many others. This is the absolutely the best and greatest experience of all! Awesome acceleration, superb handling, good comfort, excellent reliability and good gas mileage. It's all I expect from a car and it's made in America.",4
1909,"I purchased my Aveo in Sept 2007 when I traded in my 2005 Cobolt. Have driven 11,00+ miles in all road conditions, weather conditions, both highway and city. I couldn't be more pleased with the way it handles, reliability, gas mileage and appearance. I have received numerous compliments on it. I can't understand why I don't see more of them on the road and why they are advertised very little. I would recommend this car to anybody and in fact have done so.",4
1910,"My wife and I planned to buy a SUV since our small Corolla did not work. We went to the nearby Ford dealer. Tested Escape first, then Explorer, at last Freestyle. Escape is kind of noisy, Explorer is perfect at that aspect, however, it is kind of big for my wife. Freestyle is just perfect. It is also quiet, although it is not as good as Explorer. It is easy to drive this Crossover.",3
1911,"Loving it so far. Amazing room, great build quality at this price point. Does not feel like an ""entry-level"" car at all. Getting great MPG and is great handling and fun to drive.",3
1912,"This Expy makes our 3rd. A gold XLT witht he 4.6 V-8, an black XLT with the bigger V* and this white 08 XLT. The progression and evolution of these vehicles is remarkable. The 08 is a s good as anything from any other manufacturer, including GMC, Chevy, Toyota, Nissan and Honda...and in fact better than them in many ways. The quality is great, features for the price remarkable, ride and handling not at all what we expected, very smooth, quiet and controlled. The V8, as typical for the Expedition, does not feel as peppy as the sound and horsepower would indicate, but it's a trailer pulling mule! Big and barn like inside, comfortable seats, leg room and head room great. Love it!",4
1913,"I was an engineer at Chrysler. My father at GM. I drive for a living. Quality: First USA car with no manufacturing defects. Looks great. Handles Highway: the worst I have ever driven. Printed dangerous handling warning on visor. Best mileage: small 6 with the gas efficient rear end. Best handling: same. Interior: They fired their engineers 30 years ago. I could write pages on their lack of cab engineering. Everything is in the wrong place, works the wrong way, is the wrong size, whatever. E.G. try changing a fuse if you are not an anorexic 8-year old (need flashlight). Try getting groceries out of the back seat. No fan switch off. Center knob: Off(1),vent(1),AC(6).",2
1914,"For a base level sedan (w/navi) Acura certainly packs in the features. Voice recognition, rear view camera, GPS w/ real-time traffic option, sequential sport shifting. Low torque is the only drawback - though it's not enough to impede a speedy freeway entry or over-taking. The manual shifting more than compensates. General fit and finish - though well done - could use a little more of a solid feeling and refinement. Overall - very happy with the purchase.",3
1915,The stabilitrack light comes on and the dealers can not find a problem. The vehicle once would not move when that light came on. We finally used Onstar to capture the error code but the dealerships we took it to could not identify the problem. The windows are slow to go up and are noisy.,1
1916,"I definately would give give this SUV a FIVE-STAR. It is such a great vehicle to drive. It's reliable, classy, and fun. All the kids and their friends fit in just fine. When it's just the adults, it's certainly a nice ride. I compare it to the other SUV's out their, and this one tops them all, especially the for the price you pay. Chrysler did good, just wish you were continuing to make them. My lease is coming up and I now want a HEMI. Oh, what's a girl to do!!!",4
1917,"I love my Aurora Blue s touring hatch! I just bought it a couple days ago and feel that it is the best. It is so cute, sporty, luxurious and fun. Road noise is not an issue and it's quieter with less wind noise than my father's 10 year old avalon that cost more money. It's great on the highway too. The engine makes a satisfying sporty growl. When you press the unlock button twice, all doors plus the hatch open. This car beats all of the competition and is the best value for the money",4
1918,"We have had our Saturn XE Vue FWD for 11 months now and recently purchased a Toyota Venza which we now can compare it to. The Saturn 4-cyl. is a very good match for this vehicle. The 4 speed auto trans. works very well, but I like the Venza 6-speed better. The Saturn has a very comfortable ride and has a great deal of room inside. The driver sits nice and high and this vehicle has an extra fat steering wheel, which I also like. The as built quality looks to be as good as the Toyota. The price makes the Saturn Vue an excellent value in the market, even as we see GM going through all of this change. I would buy another one without question.",4
1919,"I've owned more than 18 cars over the past 23 years (mostly premium imports -- Audi, BMW, MB, Lexus, Acura), and the A5 is one of my favorites. It's an exceptional combination of style, performance, comfort and build quality. No car can do everything perfectly, but this one does so many things extremely well. I might even keep this car longer than a year or two.",4
1920,I have been looking to get a tacoma since 2005 when the reviews came out on the new v-6 with the 6-speed manual. my wait was well worth it. I love this pick-up. plenty of power and all but one very small feature I wanted. Best in class by far I research for 2 and half years and always came up with the same answer for what I wanted. Toyota Tacoma,4
1921,"I was looking for something sexy to replace my Jeep Liberty and certainly found it in the Crossfire. It's gorgeous, fun, and gets much better gas mileage. Of course, it helped that the dealership knocked $12K off the list to sell it...and yes, it was brand new! Is it worth the list of $37K? No and that's why they're discontinuing them. But, for $25K? Absolutely!",3
1922,"The Kia Sportage is a very good car for the price it is worth. I was going to buy a ford edge but instead I got the Kia Sportage. So far the car has been doing well; the fuel economy is great - 22 in the city and 27 in the highway. There is one problem when the highway you hear the road too much but everything else is great. I recommend it for a family of 4 or 5. The trunk space is really good and the seats fold flat to make the trunk bigger. It is a great car, looks kind of sporty andhas a nice touch to it. It could use more power but that's ok.",3
1923,"We bought it because our family was growing and we needed a little extra room for the family car. We've been really pleased with how well its done so far. We recently took a roadtrip to the mountains and I averaged 28 MPG with the AC on. Usually I get 21-22 in the city. Just a few downsides. So far, we are pleased with the purchase.",3
1924,"I purchased my versa in July of 06 and I love it! However my check tire pressure light continually comes on, the dealership is fantastic with fixing it but its just lit up for the 3 or 4th time. Also check your tire wells, I had water that had leaked into the well from the back window not being sealed all the way. So check that out.",3
1925,"I have owned a 1993 Camry and a 2001 Camry, and this 2008 Camry is terrible compared to those two. I am so disappointed in the cheap plastic parts, the terrible squeaks and rattles and the horrible transmission. This vehicle is by far, the best looking Camry I have had, but the worst quality of the three. It has already been in the shop FOUR TIMES. My other Camrys were never in the shop for anything other than oil changes!!",1
1926,First import I've owned and I like it. Corners like it's on rails. Plenty of zip and room. Holds my golf clubs and electric cart plus my other essential golf stuff and still room for a twelve-pack. This is behind the rear seats without folding anything down.,3
1927,"What you see is what you get! Solid little runabout. I use it for work and at 6'2 and 200 lb with long legs, I am quite comfortable. The fold down front pass. seat allows you to haul 8' long items. The only thing a bit small is the rear cargo area width and height. But I knew that going in. I get 23 to 25 in mixed driving. I am not heavy footed and I don't see doing much better. Speeds over 70 and heavier loads drop the mpg. I think you can get 27-28 at 50-55 mph. Like the looks and convenience features of the limited. Got it for under 20k out the door with rebates. Exceeding my expectations.",3
1928,"I've had my '08 CTS for about a month now, and the commercials are spot on - this car turns me on every time I fire it up. It's a real head turner, and I've gotten more looks and thumbs ups than with any other car. Mine has the 6 speed w/ DI engine, and most every option available. I say most options because one that I really wanted - AWD, was not available with the stick. I test drove the G35X, BMW 335iX, Audi A4 Quattro and finally the CTS and it was love at first sight. The CTS is really that good, and a bit bigger than the others. I really wanted AWD and I might have a different opinion after the snow falls, but I'm planning in investing in a decent set of snow tires. We'll see..",4
1929,"Purchased this Patriot in December 2007 after owning a Liberty for 4 years. Love the looks of the vehicle, spaciousness inside, and the gas mileage. Gas mileage is much better than what we were getting with our Liberty. Gets around in the snow fine without using the 4-wheel drive. Great vehicle for the price.",4
1930,"I have really bad car A.D.D., and have driven most mainstream cars that have come out in the past 15 or so years. Hondas and Toyota / Lexus are always my favorites (for the obvious reasons), and Honda has really upped their game even more with their new lineup. For the price (especially w / the great lease offers they have), the new Civic is a really smart option. Probably one of the best cars in this price range as far as curb appeal, build quality, gas mileage, and general ""fun to drive"" factors go. Definitely recommend it!",4
1931,"I have to say - this is my first Subaru and I'm pretty impressed with it. It seems well put together and pretty solid. It's a great commuter that handles well. With all the negative hype about Subarus and fuel economy, I seem to average 26 mpg in mixed driving and during my daily commutes. Good little car - I can see myself getting another Subaru!",4
1932,"We looked high and low to replace our Honda Pilot this time last year. I saw the Outlook in a magazine and went to see it for myself. My wife wanted another Pilot. I wanted a larger Tahoe/SUV. (Glad we didn't go there now!) After the first year we can honestly say, it is the best automobile we have ever owned! But why would you want to pay more for the GMC/Buick sibling when they are made side by side in the same plant but are thousands more because of the name plate? I have suggested this SUV to many friends and all have six have purchased and all have great things to say.",4
1933,I've owned my '07 E350 with the no-cost sport option for 30 days and I could not be happier with it. I hope it is reliable. So far so good. I purchased the extended 7 year warranty. My '97 E320 was very unreliable and gave me a lot of problems.,4
1934,"This SUV handles like truck and rides like truck in regular road. I took it to off road recently, I wish I could return it, it was worst riding than 18 wheelers. (1) In 2 months A/C motor had to be replace. (2) Back up light at night is so bad you can not see the curb (try it). (3) You need to continually give gas to go forward, or it will drastically slow down. (4) Now motor sit adjusting on the drive side makes noise. (5) So on, it is just bad SUV.",0
1935,"I love my new '08 Escape. It looks great, it?s fast and spacious. Gas mileage in the city has been about 19.8-21mpg. Excellent smooth ride on long trips. We have done 3500 miles in it. One problem - the rear makes a ""rocking"" noise when the vehicle is just about to stop. The dealer has it for a 2nd time and cant work out what it is? The rear brakes grind when you press the pedal when in P or N. Has anyone else had this problem? Very annoying! I may have a lemon? They should have put 4 disc brakes instead. Overall I love the SUV but this problem is driving me crazy. To date they have replaced the mirror motor on the drivers side, replaced a broken seal on the rear brakes and the left axle!",2
1936,"You don't have to be stupid to buy anything else, but it helps. 100K warranty, low initial price, 35 miles to a gallon endlessly on regular. Smooth ride, great seats with lumbar support, a/c, at, pw/dl, tilt wheel, am/fm/cd/st, spacious trunk, arm rest, power hook-ups, ample head room in back seat for six footers. All this for around $13K. Are you kidding me? Why buy anything else? This is my 6th Rio in 8 years. I still own four of them and all except this one have over 120,000 miles on them and still run strong, use zero oil and get 35 mpg HW. I change the oil myself at 5,000 mile intervals, religiously. Routine maintenance essential. Nobody builds a better car at these prices.",4
1937,"I purchased this truck for its great looks and big bed. I have had many Chevy trucks in the past but this is the best by far. Drives like a big car and rides like one. Pulls a car trailer with a car on it like nothing is behind it, and it is the 4.3 v6. Love the rack steering. Wish it had a grab handle on the drivers side so I wouldn't have to grab the steering wheel to enter the cab. Don't care much for the black cloth on the seats. Shows my cat's hair.",4
1938,"I love everything about this car. I have no regrets at all about purchasing it. I have made a couple up grades to it and I love it even more. You can't get a better car for the price and that no haggle price on the car does not mean a no haggle extended warranty. I got a 7 year extended warranty, the wheel and tire warranty, and the anti-theft for practically nothing.",4
1939,"Looks, looks, looks. That's what the new C350 has going for it. I love the AMG styling, handling, and sportiness. Sometimes the suspension beats you up on PA potholes, but I'm used to driving a heavier car. It's lightening fast too. MPG is a bit low for a car, but performance makes up for it. Wish the interior was just a bit more posh vs. functional, but the new NAV is leaps and bounds ahead of old MB designs. Overall, I would recommend this car. It's a Mercedes, and surprisingly affordable vs the competition!! Go for it. Palladium Silver is a beautiful color.",3
1940,I am a Ford person. I have owned six and I have to say I love this car. It is fun to drive and great on gas. I have the sync and the Siruis radio. Can't get better than that.,3
1941,"We've had this car about a month and have but about 1500 miles on it. On the NJ Turnpike it got about 31 MPG running at 70 mph and has been getting 22 in the city. Plenty of power, great handling, and practical layout. Much zippier and tighter on the road than the outback, plus better mileage. I bought this car for my wife to replace a minivan. We argue over who gets to drive it. My only gripes, only one power outlet on the dash area and that is inside the ash tray, so the tray must be open to power the radar detector. The porsche designed motor has plenty of power, but can be noisy at times. We have a large dog and she fits nicely in the back with three suit cases. Get one while you can.",4
1942,"Just got it, sold my gas hog Dodge Ram 2500. Tired of putting 100$ in gas, so bought the little Ranger where can you spend under 12,000 on a new truck and still have fun in a 2008 model. Keep up the good work Ford...if it ain't broke don't fix it.",3
1943,"I chose among Highlander, Pilot and CX9. Pilot is too ugly for my taste. Highlander is too expensive with ultra-cheap 3rd row and non-splittable. CX9 is the best deal out there. I was worrying about the reliability like most potential buyers would be. No problem for me after 1 year. Mazda service in my area is also superb. Loaners for repairs (TSB, etc.) and major services. The bottom like is that CX9 drives like a BMW X5 with more than $20K saved in your bank.",3
1944,"The car drives great and makes me very happy. I am an ex-mustang cobra convertible driver, and although that car was fun, it was a headache on my wallet and I never knew when the next major maintenance would arise. This is a great car, so jump on the 2.0 liter before they change it to compete w/Subaru! This engine is lighter than the 2.3 and in my opinion, more fun to drive.",3
1945,"This is my 4th Nissan, from a BT-10 Datsun, Pathfinders, 280-Z, to my new Xterra, and I am most pleased. I feel so very safe with its remarkable handling and ease in driving.",3
1946,"Overall, the new 2008 Altima is much larger, more stylish and much ""different"" car. The Altima's CVT is something to get very used to; not hearing the shifts or feeling when the car is shifting makes the car feel like it's constantly whining. However having that constant thrust of flowing power is also a positive. Personally, Nissan never lived up to the expectation of Toyota or Honda, but this Nissan (especially the coupe) may have Honda buyers look at Nissan. However, take one ride in a new 2008 Honda Accord, and you won't ever look back at Nissan.",2
1947,"First off, I'm an admitted car nut. Get all the mags, spend too much time on car lots late at night. When deciding on a new car, my priorities were safety, AWD, engineering, style, and value. This one has it all in spades.",4
1948,"We traded in my 2001 Honda Civic for the Pilot. Like other reviewers, we looked at the MDX, Highlander etc. This was my favorite by far. I love the look of this truck vs a cross over. I feel like I have a presence on the road and I love looking at the car. The interior could be a little more fashionable It is pretty simple but it has plenty of storage space and room for all passengers. We recently had 6 adults in the car for an hour and everyone was comfortable. Comfortable, fun to drive, great leather and XM. Who wouldn't love this vehicle? I see a lot of complaining about the gas mileage. I am getting about 17- 18 mpg in city and 20 mpg if I am on the freeway. Pretty good!",4
1949,"I love this car!!! This thing has some great power! Not to mention a great stereo, great handling, Great ride, and awesome style. I would highly recommend this car to anyone! I would definely buy another one. :)",4
1950,"This car needs new tires due to a factory defect, it has always bounced down the road, now, we know why. It now needs a rear upper control arm kit. The company will pro rate the tires, using some sort of formula, based on tire depth and mileage. We were told by our dealer that there is no pro-rated money allowed based on the formula. The car is dangerous. I feel let down by Honda.",1
1951,"I test-drove the Chevrolet Cobalt, Mazda 3, and Nissan Sentra. For the money, the Suzuki SX4 Sport is the best. The Cobalt would have cost $20 less a month (purchase), but was the no- options, manual-windows-and-all version in white (no other colors available at that dealer). The Mazda 3 was fun, and well optioned. But it was $20 more a month. The Nissan was funny. Neat interrior, but weird seats and looks. And it was about $30 more a month. Now, the Suzuki SX4 Sport had all the options of the Mazda 3, the cool interior similar to the Sentra, and only a little more expensive than the base-model Cobalt. The paint is fantastic, I got the dark grey. And it drives like a sport sedan.",3
1952,"This is an all around great car. There are a few things missing that really surprised me coming from Honda. First the fuel economy around town is between 15 and 16 MPG rated 22 mpg. The car is driven mainly by my wife albeit on short trips but nothing exceptionally dramatic. The highway mileage is right on the rating, 25 mpg to 30 mpg. The lack of a center console and just a shelf is annoying. The arm rest on the front seats, useless, way to small. The telescoping and adjustable steering wheel no help for a long legged person trying to enter when the wife leaves the seat forward. The sun visors are to short turned to the side windows. I would recommend the car all in all a great car.",3
1953,We love this car. Great fuel economy. No problems at all. Tried to buy another make and glad we didn't now.,4
1954,"Well, you won't win any races with this Jeep. But it is a solid little SUV. In the Texas hill country yesterday and it did very well in the hills with the auto shift. First tank I got 23 mpg. Not bad on the open road. Very smooth at 75.",3
1955,"I have been driving my 2007 Acadia for 2 full years, and I still love it. I commute 30 miles one way, and spend a lot of time in the vehicle on trips. The comfort and features make it a joy to drive! I had it in the shop only one time before warranty expired for very minor issues and one recall, and it has not needed any other repairs. I get 18+MPG in town, 24+MPG on the highway - very close to what is promised. I prviously drove a 98 Oldsmobile minivan, and a 2003 Chevy Tahoe. This Acadia has as much room as the minivan, but is much more stylish and comfortable, and it is much more roomy and functional than the Tahoe. Highly recommend to families with small children or teenagers!",4
1956,This car performs awesome. I love how tight the steering is but wish the ride was a little smoother. Being AWD you can take a turn so fast ( try those hairpin turns on the interstate) the car grips the road the entire time without slowing down!,4
1957,"I like my Jeep Patriot. It is a very good vehicle. When bad weather hits I never have to worry about getting to where I want to go. It gets decent gas mileage for an SUV, and I haven't had any mechanical problems. I wish it had an automatic transmission instead of a manual transmission. All-in-all, it's a good car that I would recommend to Jeep lovers.",4
1958,"I purchased my Focus in June of '08, after driving a gas guzzling minivan for 5 years. After looking at Toyotas, Hondas, Chevys and Mazdas, the Focus was just the best idea for cost and reliability. I'm at 17,500 miles and have no issues. The gas mileage got up to 41mpg highway, but also as low as 27mpg city. Being a musician and a sort of music junkie, it's just amazing how seamlessly my Zune works with Sync. It's a good looking car with lots of options and features; it just gets you where you need to go - in style.",4
1959,"Bought the MDX for utility, but drive it for fun now. I have an older Audi A4 quattro sedan, and was looking for a larger vehicle with more reliability for my weekend golf and ski trips. Didn't think I would prefer driving this full time. It corners as well as the A4! I can also load lots of gear in the back, and rear seat passengers sit in comfort. I compared this to the BMW X3, X5, 328xi wagon, Infiniti EX35, FX35, and the smaller sibling RDX. The MDX has an unbeatable combination of performance, utility, luxury, and price! Yes, price! While gas prices are high, you can get this vehicle for under invoice prices!",4
1960,"What a great car. Can't beat the bang for the buck. The tech package is amazing, the acceleration is great and the car is useful and fun to drive. The only two negatives are the gas mileage (I only get about 20 mpg) and the fact that the front passenger seat isn't power. Otherwise, I can't complain about one thing!",3
1961,The Tiburon has to be one of the best kept secrets in the automotive world as you don't see many on the road. Heads do turn and people do ask about the Tib everywhere we go. An excellent vehicle and price - just drive one and you will understand. I have owned 7 vehicles and paid a lot more for the others but love this one the most!,4
1962,"We have had nothing but problems from our 2007 entourage. It has been in the shop for 26 business days (m-f only) and 5 times (8000 mi). We have the same knocking noise others have mentioned, which it has gone up in smoke for (a/c burned out) and stranded us on the interstate w/ my 4 mo old. We have rattles/creaks etc. Poor gas mileage. The a/c is knocking again and we are claiming lemon law. Just yesterday after picking it up from being at the dealer 2 weeks, the airbag light came on. We were told they couldn't get it in until Friday (it is wed) but not to drive it b/c we won't have airbags in the event of a crash (no rentals avail). And Hyundai warranty does not guarantee a rental.",0
1963,"I bought this after 3 BMWs and did so because service is so awful on BMWs in Southern California. Lexus service is truly amazing and so far ahead of any other car type that it is hard to believe. However, this car is like driving down the road on a jello square. It handles loosely, and because of the continuously variable transmission it feel like you are driving a motor boat more than a car.",3
1964,"Wherever you go, you can hear people announce your arrival (""Smart car!""). That aside, the car has unexpected power on the highway. This car, like a small dog, doesn't know it's small. Love the convertible top, though, which can open and close at any speed. Mercedes technology makes the car very quiet with the roof up compared to other convertibles (like the noisy Miata, for example). You get used to the upshift from 1st to 3rd, although my spouse prefers to use the paddle shifters for a smoother transition.",3
1965,I love my rabbit. It sold itself to me on the test drive. No other car came close to that. I hit 95 mph without even noticing. Could be trouble but it's a smooth ride I haven't found a single thing to complain about yet. Only 23 mpg on first tank of gas though with lots of highway driving. I think I'm just being heavy on the gas though.,3
1966,"Excellent car, all round driving fuel economy of 27 with 50% and town driving. Comfortable ride, solid feel on the highway. Would advise anyone to test drive if looking for an American car.",4
1967,I must admit I wasn't at all excited about getting this car. I had to lower my payments quickly due to some financial changes. I looked at the Mazda 3 & the Honda Civic. I just couldn't get a better price for the features that I got. My car is loaded with everything including leather. I'm very impressed with the fuel economy & I already have over 6k miles on my car. Rear seat passengers are always impressed with the leg room that a car this small offers. I am very happy with my decision and recommend this car to anyone in the market for an upscale economy car. it can't be beat for the price.,4
1968,"I am a Truck Person but with the gas price nowadays I decided to try this little thing, it is the best decision I ever made it is a very nice looking car, reliable, sporty I like it very much,",4
1969,"We purchased this car for my wife in May of 2008. A life long Honda/Toyota owner, she pursued test driving those makes. Accords, Civics, Corollas, Nissans, she test drove them all, often several times. She came away unsatisfied with all of them for one reason or another (style, driving experience, interior quality.) Then, on the way to test drive yet another Accord (YAWN) she saw an Aura on the road and that was that. The car's beauty, performance, engineering, and price were absolutely second to none. Perfect car. People offer positive comments about the car often...",4
1970,"This is an awesome fun sports car for the enthusiast or the first timer like my girl friend who learned to drive this sporty short-throw 6 speed in about 1/2 an hour. The heated leather seats in the GT model are unbelievable! Top down, windows up, heater on and a sunny day is ALL you need for Fun Fun Fun or should I say Zoom Zoom Zoom. I can now see why this is the world's most popular selling sports car convertible!",4
1971,"I have had several Maximas in the past and have always been pleased but this one has me scratching my head. Love the car with a few exceptions. The front end squeaks like a 90-year old wooden wagon. Have taken it into the dealership 14 times for repair, can't pinpoint the problem even with the stethoscope. Have gone back now and tried to drive several other year models with the same body style and ALL have the same squeaking noise coming from the front end. Doesn't do it all the time only when the weight of the car is on that side. Very embarrassing going thru parking lots or areas where the ground is not level. Love the CVT - man this car will fly!!! Just can't get past the noise.",2
1972,"I bought this car to use as my commuter vehicle into NYC from New Jersey every day. It was all about fuel economy. After using it, my whole family prefers to take the Prius on trips rather than a larger, less economical car because of the room and the ride. I am considering getting rid of that to get my wife a Prius. My fuel economy is less than I expected, but still better than any other car my 6'3"" frame would fit in, at an average of 44 mpg in mostly stop and go driving. I have gotten as good as 52 mpg though with ""regular"" driving. I have not had any problems with this vehicle, so I can't complain on that front. All in all this car is a winner!",3
1973,I was excited to get the fit but disappointed when I realized it maxed out at 35 mpg. In reality I'm getting 25 mpg and I drive mostly on the HWY. I hear this will get better in time. Right now Honda is purposefully not making many Fits to drive demand. Most dealerships are charging an additional 1500 to every car because of this false demand Honda is creating. Also the Fit does not come with floor mats. When you buy them you can't just lay them down but you need to cut into the floor of the car. What were they thinking with that???!!! Overall I do like the fit. It's fun to drive and looks cool in my opinion. Its a Honda so I trust it will be reliable. Time will tell.,2
1974,Bought a sorento last Sept. having this SUV for a year we like it a lot; never owned a kia or SUV before but we are very happy driving it. It rides nice and it is very comfortable.,3
1975,The vehicle was everything i dreamed about. Though it was tough to get because every dealer was selling them the second they hit the ground. Fireside treated me with the greatest respect and made me want to refer all of my friends. I love the car!,4
1976,My 2008 CTS AWD is now 15 months old and still drives great but I'm starting to see some of the old GM aging. I've recently had my car in for some quirky problems and have noticed wear in the interior components including gaps between components. I think this is also contributing to noticeable interior wind noise. All-in-all the car still drives great and has handled excellent on snowy roads this winter.,3
1977,"I bought my offroad exterra new. After comparing and testing to the fj cruiser. I found that the exterra was much more versatile and tougher built. I drive my vehicle every day on and offroad. With the back seat folded down there is almost the same amount of room as a small truck, with the convenience of being able to put the seats back up for passengers. I've owned this vehicle for over a year and nothing slows it down. You can Cruise comfortably on the freeway, and then switch to 4 wheel drive and travel over the roughest terrain. Also it has good towing capabilities. Considering that the v-6 is more powerful than most v-8s and that it is an offroad 4x4 it gets great mpg w/out being boring.",3
1978,"Took delivery of this beauty in Stuttgart. The Euro Delivery Program is highly recommended and will save you major bucks. Plus Mercedes really does a great job taking care of you. For those of you who need a 4-door but want a sports car, there isn't anything that comes close to this car. It flies and feels like it's on rails through corners. When the governor maxed out on the Autobahn at 130 mph, it still felt effortless to drive. Check it out, you won't go wrong with this car.",4
1979,"I needed a vehicle with great gas mileage, yet big enough to hold luggage, two keyboards, stands, an amp, a large box of equipment, a large dog crate and a bicycle. I can fit all of this and more into my little Civic Hybrid. While shopping I actually had salespeople attempt to load my music equipment into a Prius but it would not fit. This little Civic is a joy to drive, looks great, is quiet and comfy and has all of the safety features I have come to love and trust about Hondas. I get anywhere between 43 to 57 miles per gallon, and find this to be a zippy little machine. I previously drove a Chevy Malibu and loved it, but for the savings in gas the Civic wins the day. Sweet little car!",4
1980,"Has as much or more power than any prev. vehicle I've owned. Very quick take offs when needed! Really performs well. Hugs the curves. Has a smooth ride, almost like gliding, especially in electric mode. First couple tanks of gas, we got just over 36 MPG, but that has consistently gotten better. The stereo is out of this world!! I think it comes standard. This car has been mistaken for higher end cars, one thought it was a Lexus, another thought it was a Mercedes. People always overestimate the price of the car. Overall, I LOVE THIS CAR!!!",4
1981,"Previously purchased an '07 Subaru Outback and disappointed with the interior space, although a great driving machine. Have had the Rav4 for 3 weeks and my wife and I absolutely love this car. Excellent driving position and front seat comfort and visibility while the 4 cylinder engine provides more than adequate power. If we lived up north I would recommend the all wheel drive, but in Maryland and/or further south the FWD is excellent since EST and traction control are standard. The 6 cylinder only truly necessary if one lives in a hilly area. Averaging 25 MPG. Our favorite car in 40 years of driving.",4
1982,"Purchased my 2008 GT AWD in August of this year w/ 9k miles on it. It replaced our 2006 Chrysler T&C Van. My wife absolutely loves the CX9. I drive a 05 Audi A4 Quattro w/ sport pkge and I am amazed at how well the Mazda handles and drives for a larger heavier vehicle. If you need 3 rows of seats and don't have to have sliding doors, then make sure you drive one of these before purchasing anything else. We test drove 10 different crossovers and SUV's and kept going back to the Mazda. I also drove the Touring model. The GT does not ride that much firmer for how much better it handles and looks. Love the sliding 2nd row for entry/exit and the legroom. Ours is loaded and we love it.",4
1983,"We absolutely love this car! This is my wife?s car but I try to make excuses everyday just to drive it. The 2.0T engine is fabulous! No turbo lag and handling is great. DSG is amazing! I am not sure why high end cars don?t have DSG. This will be the benchmark for sequential gear boxes and the future of changing gears. The finish is fantastic. VW has put the fun back in the Jetta. Reliability is still a question mark. Hopefully VW fixed this issue. Overall, this car is a sensation! Should you get one? You bet you should.",4
1984,"Amazing handling and comfort for a large SUV. The design is very sharp with the 20"" wheels. Get comments on it regularly. The navigation system, stereo, etc are top of the line. Nice twist on the back up camera. All that while hauling three kids in car seats, 2 dogs and a 5,000lb boat. Very nice looking, functional and solid vehicle.",4
1985,"I rated this car first of all after being very frustrated. The rattle is not fixed yet, but after having to take a 2600 mile trip, thank goodness for XM. The gas mileage was awesome, I, at one point, got over 400 miles on one tank, of course, filled to the brim. Comfort was awesome, even without cruise, but it hung with the big boys on the highway and in the mountains. I retract my first review.",3
1986,Bought in January - $21.9K internet price and have not been disappointed in the least replacing a '99 DeVille. Overall MPG average has steadily increased to 45 MPG over 8000 miles as I have learned and adjusted driving habits. Last several tanks between 48 to 50. High tank was 56 MPG! Estimate $1K savings in gas over the Caddy so far which got 19-20 MPG & took premium & that is very noticeable in the checkbook. Fun to drive & my wife takes it when she can over her '02 Crown Vic.,3
1987,"I am pleasantly surprised by the quality, comfort and performance of this vehicle. Mileage in town is about 23.5 mpg and highway hovers around 29.5. In full automatic mode the car accelerates at a moderate pace, but using the auto-stick really kicks it in gear. Adequate in-car capacity (although I would recommend covering the seat backs if you haul anything that may snag them). Seat comfort and adjustability offer enough range for just about anyone. I am glad I bought this vehicle.",3
1988,"I was convinced I was going to buy a Honda Civic but the Hyundai warranty and greater interior space hooked me. When I saw the standard features I could get for my money I was sold. My car has factory XM radio, alloy wheels, steering wheel controls for audio system and cruise. All of which I would have paid more for with the Honda. This is the first 4 cylinder car I've owned in years and the lowest price car I've had in a couple of decades. It fits the bill for me with the MPG and features. The bad news, it takes the corners worse than anything I've driven in years. For every day driving it's fine, good commuter but stay off the twisty roads!",3
1989,"Bought this for my wife on July 16th, and we have been nothing but overly impressed over the last month we have owned it. I just got back from a lengthy road trip to visit family, and in addition to being a great car to take on a road trip because of its superb merging/passing power, ample room, solid handeling, super smooth, comfy ride, and great stereo, everyone that saw it was impressed, as well... and this is from people who normally drive BMW and Lexus. We got the white XR with the tan leather interior, and it's a sophisticated look that even the teenager it the house thinks is cool. With the sharp European looks and great ride, I feel it's the best kept secret in town.",4
1990,"I bought my 2007 Camry hybrid used a little over a year ago. Hands down the best car I've ever had. Its quiet, smooth and has all the power you'll ever need. With the CVT transmission there's no shifting. Most people think hybird = no power. I'm 51 years old and this car has as much power as any that I've ever owned. I bought my Camry with 59,000 miles on it. It now has 78,000 miles on it. I've only had 1 problem. It didn't start at 20 below zero. I can't wait to see how long my brakes last. I was told 200,000 to 300,000 miles they look great so far. Oh I almost forgot I get between 38 to 41 mpg March though November and about 35 to 38 mpg in the winter.",4
1991,"This is by far an excellent ride. My previous vehicle was also a Liberty and what a difference. The 08 Liberty has much more room and also sits higher. It's a more stable, smooth ride and handles well in the snow even when it's not in 4X4. The rear and front seat fold flat. The previous Liberty did not and also the front seats had to be pushed all the way forward in order for the seats to fold down. That is not the case with the 08 Liberty.",4
1992,"replaced 2000 Jaguar S Type 3.0. Needed more leg room and a larger trunk. Miss my memory seat & steering. The build quality is as good as any import I have owned ( Jaguar, Volvo, Infinity etc.)",3
1993,After going from my 13 yr old base style Corolla to this standard loaded out car I feel like I've hit the jackpot for a great price. I absolutely love it. It has pep and looks very smart. This is my favorite car I've ever had. Well worth every penny even if you don't add a thing. Feels like I'm gliding on glass it is so smooth. With the Toyota name behind it you can't go wrong. Get one!!,4
1994,The only negative comment i have about my 2008 silverado is that the front end of the truck has very little ground clearance for a 4 wheel drive vehicle. I bought a new dodge ram in 1999 and the chevrolet is far superior in quality.,3
1995,"Almost everything about this car is amazing. Each shift is smooth and, though I scoot it around >4000rpm VTEC range here and there, I'm still averaging just over 32mpg city driving. Handling is surprisingly superb, with a somewhat stiffer suspension than other cars. (Fit slalom speed is only 0.5mph under the 8th gen Si). The 200-watt stereo is quite adequate, with an unexpected amount of bass coming froms the mids (no sub). Space is amazing! It's much roomier than it looks; at least, that's what everyone has said to me when they've got a ride. My only complaint is the lack of JDM accessories (i.e. armrest, passenger vanity, maplights, LED tail lights, HID, sunroof, subwoofer, navi, etc)",3
1996,"This is my second Audi A6 and this is an entirely new vehicle that was redesigned from the bottom up. On a 350 mile trip at avg speed of 75mph I got 30 MPG! Quiet cabin, great ergonomics,and the NAV is the best I have ever seen. The sound system is fantastic. Headlights are improved. I did find the sunroof to be a little small but it is not as important compared to all the positives.",3
1997,"First Ford truck I have owned, 4 Chevys previously. Had Ford a short time but am very impressed with the small things compared to Chevy. cup holder on dash, cruise on wheel, power package for base truck (windows,doors, mirrors), light weight tailgate, bed light comes on automaticly, side running boards.",3
1998,"After driving higher-end, foreign vehicles for the past 12 years, I decided to give an American-made car a try. Before I decided on the Saturn Aura, I already tested a Saab 9-3, Mercedes C, Audi A4 and Lexus IS250. The Aura was roomier, quieter, more comfortable and almost as nimble as these much higher priced cars. It's fresh exterior has piqued the interest of many fellow motorists, who have stopped me in parking lots and at the car wash. To a person, folks were very impressed and even more so, when I told them the cost of my XR which is equipped with every available option Saturn offers.My other vehicle is a pricey foreign make yet I get as much a kick from the Aura as I do from it.",3
1999,I was looking for a car with value for my money. I didn't want to spend a load of money on features which are attractive but after a while we don't use it. Kia Sorento was perfect in my budget and the other accessories i was looking for. So far the car is running absolutely fine.,3
2000,"Smart passion coupe delivered 1 week ago. so far, my impressions are extremely favorable. have driven @ 400 miles in 5 days. good handling at highway speeds (70-75 mph). decent handling on hills and in high winds.",3
2001,"Very pleased with the first month of ownership of the new Sequoia. Traded 2nd of two Navigators owned for improved reliability and equal towing capacity. Early highway mileage is 22mph @ 65 mph; overall highway and around town averaging 17mpg on regular gas. Cargo area same size as Navigator. I purchased the Limited edition and added running lights, power rear door,backup camera. The Platinum edition requires 20 in. low profile tires which ride harder and are more difficult to balance. Nav system was too far away to safely use while driving and I have my own Nuvi I like better. With the Limited you lose memory seats. Toyota needs to unbundle 18 inch wheels, memory seats, nav, offer options.",2
2002,"In most respects the Prius is wonderful. Though it's not a performance car, it's competent, comfortable, and quiet. The only serious dislike is the center control counsole, which complicates control of the heat/ac and radio -- and the digital speedometer and other gauges/displays. Analog gauges and traditional knobs and levers to control the heat/ac and radio would make this a better car. Of course, it's the Prius' gas mileage performance that makes it a winner. I've gotten about 45 mpg overall at 2000 miles.",3
2003,"Great car, love the look and quality. Fun car to drive and we love the satellite radio. Roomy interior and very quite ride. Would highly recommend this vehicle.",4
2004,Our SEL Ford Edge awd has been fixed 4 times and I smell burning oil again.They replaced seals and whole unit and it still leaks!!! Ford needs to let us Edge owners know how and when they can solve this problem.,1
2005,"I have owned over 30 cars in the last 11 years-- many lux/sporters as well as 6 SUVs--suburban, 2 mits monteros, suzuki, 2 pilots and a Honda ridgeline too. I had always thought the 4runners were over priced--until I found a used 2008 Toyota certified one owner 45k mile sr5 in Denver for ~$22k. Very impressed with the ergonomic/practical design AND I actually get 22+ mpg in city and 27+mpg on highway!!---puts my Honda pilot and any other full sized SUVs to shame. None better! Now I know why they are so popular.",4
2006,So far so good. I have owned Honda Accords for the past 15 years so this was a big departure from tradition. Time will tell if the reliability factor is there.,3
2007,"Out of searching for a good SUV, this one is perfect. I got the D package, because I hate power windows, and remotes, so it saved money. It has 4x4 with the Freedom Drive I CVT2. I bought it for road driving, but got 4wd in case I need to go off-road for something, and for snow and heavy rain. So far, it has been great. It handles very well, and now that I'm getting used to the CVT, has great acceleration. You can really feel the AWD help in daily driving, and the 4wd locking lever is easily accessible So far, been having about 24 mpg on average, with a combination of city and highway driving. This is definitely the vehicle for the more sensible buyer. And best of all, made in USA!",4
2008,Bought an AWD/AT version and love it so far. Very fun to drive despite the relatively sluggish performance. The outward visibility takes some getting used to but in general it is as good as it gets in a car of this configuration. I've discovered one odd thing about this car that prospective buyers should know: the owner's manual says that the AWD/AT version cannot be towed with either the front or rear wheels on the pavement due to potential damage of the drivetrain. I haven't asked my dealer about this yet but I can't believe that any car maker would design a car that requires a flatbed tow truck. The standard transmission and FWD versions do not carry this warning.,3
2009,"Mine is an SL with the tech and sport packages (i.e., every option available) So far I am very impressed with my Versa. I cross-shopped this car with the Fit, Rondo, Yaris, VW City Golf (Canada-only model) and even the Mazda 3. in the end it was between this and the Fit. I chose the Versa because it had a better interior and was better value for money. So far (~4000 miles) nothing has gone wrong and there hasn't even been the customary ""mysterious new car dash squeak."" It feels like I'm driving a high quality product and not an econobox. The CVT takes a bit of getting used to, but it really suits this engine and doesn't feel bogged down like the 4 spd auto in my '04 Sentra.",3
2010,"I work in the plant that builds the Tundras so I know a lot about them and plus I just bought one a few months ago so I am going to be as honest as I can be about it. Overall the Tundra is a great truck but like all other vehicles it could have some improvements. But Toyota does a lot of things to there vehicles that the domestic companies do not do like Toyota puts sealer on the edge door seams to keep from rusting and spray pvc under the vehicle and in the wheels wells to reduce road noise and to prevent rust, sprays antichip along rocker panels to prevent rock chips. I think all of these extra little things add up and is what makes Toyotas good reputation.",3
2011,"I've owned this van for over a year now, and have not had any problems at all with it. I purchased it used with 20k miles, and I've since put on 10k, mostly on the highway. The van is large and spacious, similar to Odyssey, Sienna and Caravan (I've driven all of these). The performance is very good considering it's size, and you have to remember that it's a minivan, not a sports car. I think the build quality is good, not quite up to Sienna or Odyssey levels, but on par with the Caravan. The 5 year 60k mile warranty is a reassuring factor, but I have not yet had to take advantage of it. Also, I think gas mileage is pretty good, I get about 26 mpg on the highway, with a moderate load.",3
2012,"I have to say Mercedes Benz has done a great job with this vehicle. I had my doubts at first but after driving it for a week now I've really gotten into this thing. Its comfortable, smooth, and can handle alot of cargo if the time comes. 7-speed auto gives the engine maximum flexibility, but it still drinks gas like any full size.",3
2013,"Owned 3 Camrys-1991,1995 & 2004; due to satisfactory previous ownership history - I made HUGE mistakes in making this purchase! Shopped all day online-made calls-night-time test drive-purchased car Saturday night. Week later realized-CHEAP BUILD & INFERIOR QUALITY of plastic material of interior, fabric, exposed metal & bolts on floor, downsized & eliminated compartments, eye/sunglass holder, small poorly designed seating-driver, passenger & rear-no elbow room-cramped interior, smaller trunk space, etc. Only 5'4 roof of car close to head. Cheap fabric on seat not sewn-just stuffed inside cheap plastic bucket of seat. Driver seat should be ergonomically correct-miserable drive.",1
2014,"Good car, no problem so far, the only thing is the lights come on when lock or unlock vehicle with the remote control, kills the battery,",3
2015,"This car is a perfect compromise daily driver. Good performance, comfort and economy. I'm getting over 35 MPG lately. Sure you can find a car that beats the MINI in a few areas but you can't find any car at any price that does all the things as well as the MINI does. It's worth the extra money you may need to pay for it. So far...",3
2016,"I've had this car for about 5 weeks and put 2000 miles on it. For the price (under $18k with 170 hp, 6 speed auto & Tiptronic) you really can't beat it. 95% of the mileage is city driving, and I avg 17.9 mpg, which isn't great but I do drive quite aggressively. Overall the car feels quite well-built, and given that I used to manage a valet lot and have driven Audi, BMW, Porsche, Lexus, Jaguar, etc, that is pretty impressive, especially at this price point. In my opinion you are basically getting a GTI at an economy car price - and my insurance is far cheaper than it would be with a sports car. The only downside is the fuel economy, but if you can get past that, this car is a winner.",3
2017,"We have only had our New Edge 1 month,but so far we love this crossover from Ford. We get a lot of second looks from people on the street, and people asking what it is. We have owned many Fords over the years and this new Edge is right close to the top of best Fords we have ever owned .Love it, love it, love it.",4
2018,Driving a Toyota Sienna is like owning a Lexus. The seats are made for real people. The pick up is ok I wish it had a little more power. I do hwy and rural driving. I would buy another one.,4
2019,"This truck is very nice. There are no rattles, this is a very SOLID truck, lots of power and torque. Sound system is crisp road noise is minimal. Plenty of room in the back of the double cab for two full sized adults (on short trips) to sit comfortably. Lots of storage compartments in the driver's compartment for stuff. I traded a 2005 Infiniti QX 56 for my Tundra, the ride is just as nice!",4
2020,"This car is amazing. I purchased the 2008 in October of 2007. Alpine white with imola red interor. Equipt with cold weather package, sport package, bigger wheels, ipod adapters, EVERYTHING! I LOVE IT! COuldn't say enough good things about it!",4
2021,"I bought this car in April and I love it. I didn't want a hybrid at all, but my husband pressured me to at least look at it and I fell in love with it. It is so fun to drive! And I am addicted to watching my mileage on that display screen. After driving it for three weeks, I have really learned how to ""drive smart"" to save gas. It's cute and sexy all at the same time, with plenty of room for my two year old and all his gear. He keeps asking if he can watch Elmo on the touch screen. Sorry buddy, this is mommy's car! I love to make fun of my friends who are getting 12 mpg in their SUVs. Purchasing a Prius is a no-brainer in this day and age of high gas prices. No regrets!",4
2022,"I have a red GT, loaded with every option! Navigation system, power roof, powerful stereo! Great looking body, fantastic build quality, rich interior, and the best production paint job I've ever seen! Build quality is superb. I've had top of the line Toyotas, Hondas, VWs, Mercedes, BMW and some Italian cars... none as well made!",4
2023,"This is my dogmobile, where it is OK to have sand all over the floors and yet is easy to clean out. Several things could be better: 1) the window visor is too small in the LX, it does not protect from the sun. They provide expanding visors in the EX, but not in the LX, weird! It is about a foot long, and should be at least 2 feet. 2) there is a blind spot on the left windscreen panel. 3) a large clunking sound when breaking or changing gears, Honda told me this is normal.",2
2024,"We were shopping for something to replace my 06 Accord that was totaled in a wreck, while at the Honda dealer the new CR-V caught our eye. It wasn't even on our list. I love the new design, didn't care for the old one. There is very little road noise in the cabin. The brakes are excellent. Large cargo area, the seats fold down easily. It is so easy to drive around town, I think the front end may be shorter than the Accord so parking is a breeze.",3
2025,The fuel economy of this truck leaves a lot to be desired. My truck is GPS'd so I am only able to drive the speed limit without getting in trouble. The best I have ever got for fuel economy is 14.8 mpg (imperial gallons). The quality of the truck is less than desirable. In cold weather (less than -20c) the back doors will not latch completely without slamming them hard. I actually knocked the molding off the door trying to get it latched. When the doors are closed they squeak and rattle so bad you have to turn the radio up. I have had to install a second battery to get the truck to start after sitting for more than 3 days. The airbag computer already stopped working and needed replacing.,1
2026,"I love this little car. The short shifter and sunroof are great. The car rides really well and is very spirited for a small car. The back seat folds down and creates a large cargo area. I took my sister and niece on a 150 mile journey. The back seat had plenty of room behind the passenger side seat. The back seat armrest and cup holder was Nice. There was no difference with one or three riders. The car rides smooth and very quite. The seats are comfortable and supportive. The rear window wiper and defroster works, the air conditioner is ice cold. Never had to change the radio station. Nice quite car and fun to drive. Get the manual. Filled up before we went needle hardly moved. Tire pressure system.",3
2027,"I commute 160 miles round trip to work every day and have 48,000 miles on this one year old LX 4 door. Reliability has been great. I have gotten up to 42 miles per gallon on the interstate and it's not a hybrid. Cruise control is used and speed is usually around 70 mph. Visibility is good. The car is a 'quiet rider'. Passing power is adequate but there are some strange transmission noises which I'm told is normal. The OEM Goodyear Eagle tires are not wearing well, 40,000 mile are getting noisy and not holding up too well and will be replaced. Overall the car is great and looks good too.",3
2028,"This is not a Dodge Durango- from the wood grain steering wheel to the leather heated 1st/2nd row seats you know this is from the flagship brand and not the step child Durango. Chrysler did an excellent job, quiet roomy interior, all the amenities, the back up sensor works great and is a must on a vehicle this size. Plus with 0% financing and lifetime warranty, there was no choice but to buy this!",4
2029,"This is my first hybrid car and I must say that it is far exceeding my expectations. My Touring grade Prius is quiet, comfortable, and smart. The cabin is open and feels bigger than it is. The hatchback is more functional then my previous mid size sedan. The smart key feature is really cool too. This is the car of the future.",4
2030,"Started out at the 2008 CAS and compared all 7 passenger cars. Narrowed it down to Saturn Outlook and the Veracruz, Saturn lost. So far 9800 miles and not a single problem other than two broken seat belt clips from a clumsy kid. Handles snow great, even through 2' drifts. I have nothing bad to say about it, only thing that is annoying is the XM radio switches back to preview channel when you switch to AM/FM. MPG on highway tops 25 MPG, but winter has it down to 17.3 overall. Summer 19 MPG. It's my favorite car. My daily driver is a Toyota Camry Hybrid, so I get to have fun once in a while and drive this instead.",3
2031,"Just got my wife into the 2LT with the Sun & Entertainment package added in. It's basically an LTZ without the chrome and the heated rear seats. We got it black with cashmere (tan) interior. It's super sharp looking. The wife loves it. Our goal was to have our three kids fit across the 2nd row bench seat, leaving plenty of cargo room -- or room for other kids. It's no problem. The kids love the DVD, and the wife is loving the sweet Bose system with sat radio, nav, and the rear view cam. I can't wait to start trying the OnStar, and try towing my boat with it. This makes our old (loaded) Pacifica look pretty lame. If you need the full size SUV for the family, this ride is truly great.",4
2032,"I had a Z4 previously and loved it, but overall I like the 1er better. Meets or exceeds every one of my expectation. The 128i is plenty fast and is more practical than the 135i. The 135i is almost stupid fast and very few drivers will be able to get more than 30% out of what the car is capable of.",4
2033,"Since I have an HHR for the city I needed something that could handle dirt roads. My Patriot is the 4WD trail rated version. Only cost $23,000, tax and license included. I have 2500+ miles and get 25mpg. Handles well in the city although the acceleration is weak. Great for washboard dirt roads which is why I bought it. I can now see desert and mountain sites I have avoided previously. Plenty of room inside for passengers and cargo. Four wheel disc brakes have a firm feel and the steering is precise.",3
2034,"I drove a 2006 4Runner until it was totaled on January 29, 2009. That vehicle gave me back my life. It suffered a severe side impact at 55 MPH, rolled twice, slid on its roof and ended up with the driver's side on the ground. I walked away with no serious injuries. Even though there was severe damage to the sides and roof of the vehicle and suspension parts and some of the drivetrain were all over the highway, the roof pillars never collapsed and the interior was intact. Before making the 06 purchase, I did check to see which SUV's best protect their occupants. The 4Runner was the leader hands down. Now I am driving an 08. This time I made sure that I had the side curtain air bags.",3
2035,"I have had this one for just over a year now. It kept stalling at low speeds. The dealer kept saying it was a calibration issue. We took it in 3 times for it to be properly calibrated. The Continental Touring tires that came OEM are bald at 14000 miles. They only come with a 12 month 12000 mile warranty and trust me...they won't last much longer than that. I would think after paying this much for a car that I could get some better OEM tires that I wouldn't have to replace in one year. The transmission is just plain goofy. It jumps all over the place at the wrong times. The front bumper is starting to come off. Dealer doesn't know why, but will try to fix it. Overall, the car is just..OK",2
2036,I do like my Vibe. Not a lot of power and some road noise. I do get get very good mileage and the car is pleasant to drive. I average 34 mpg on the highway with an automatic.,3
2037,"This SUV is perfect for city driving, and does great on the highway. The engine is not over powered if you're running the air conditioner in the city, but that's not that important, but the pick-up is there if you need it. I love the the black trim around the vehicle, your seeing less of this,the monochromatic look is not for me. The engine is not loud and you don't hear excessive road noise.",4
2038,After doing a lot of research we purchased our 2008 Sport Highlander just three weeks ago. After two weeks of driving it we started to hear a noise when we would accelerate the car. (Mind you it only has 750 miles on it). Long story short we took it in to be checked out and found out we need a new transmission!!!! We are not happy and now doubt the reliability of our car.,1
2039,"I have had my Toyota for under 30 days, I had been looking for a smaller SUV for over a year and had test drove everything from the Cadillac SRX to the Acura MDX, and at the end I finally narrowed down my options to the Toyota Highlander. The Highlander without a doubt has proven to not only be a more spacious vehicle, the new body style is awesome, looks almost like the 08 Lexus LX570. It has a sound ride not to mention how many mpg I get in the city (15-17) and (18-19) on the freeway. My kids absolutely love it and I love the fact that the 1st oil change isn't until 5000 miles.",4
2040,"I'm no stranger to performance cars,but i must say this new E 320 blutec is more fun to drive than my '06 911. The rush of power and creamy smooth ride low noise decibels, getting almost 40MPG! I was going for a S550 and test drove this E blutec and WOW.",4
2041,"The car is powerful, fast, has a great transmission and is normally fun to drive. However, I had a terrible problem with squeaks and rattles in the dashboard and other interior noises that took all the enjoyment out of driving it. Also, I am not a tall person, but the interior headroom is very limited, even with the seat fully lowered. It is very easy to bump your head getting into the car. My dealer could not fix the noise problem and reinstalled the dashboard so that it did not fit properly around the central instrument cluster. I got tired of hearing the noises everytime there was a bump in the road and after only five months and 6000 miles, I replaced it.",1
2042,"My wife and I both wanted the C300 Luxury Sedan. We have had it a week and took it on the road this past week- end and love the ride, average 28.1 MPG, love the looks inside and out. We plan on keeping the car for a long time.",4
2043,"I have had the car 15 months and in that time the fuel pressure regulator was replaced. At 14 months the car developed a rough idle and strong vibration that could not be repaired and I have been told this is ""within normal"" for this car. I have never had a rougher idling car in all the small cars I have owned.",1
2044,"We just purchased this Grand Prix, and so far have nothing but positives to say about it. And I'm a die hard Japanese car buyer. But, after speaking with many Grand Prix owners, researching and test driving, we took the step to domestic. We've met many owners with mileage well into the 100,000k, many over 150,000k, on model years '03 forward, with little if no problems. Ride is fantastic, corners like a pro, with little ""roll"". Interior comfort excellent, quite and well mannered on the road. Acceleration is excellent, and we're getting 28 to 30 on these mountain roads of SW Virginia, which by the way, the car does very well in the snow and ice. We kept our ""Subie"" as a second car",4
2045,"Honestly, I was set on buying either a Nissan Versa or Sentra but now I see that my Hyundai Accent was a great choice and is a great starter car for me because of the great gas mileage it gets and it is compact with all the necessary options. I especially love the radio because of the bigger screen and the XM. Most of all I feel safe driving it even though it is smaller than most cars. It has great control and sustains the bumps and potholes on the streets. Overall, I would recommend any student driver to purchase this car because it is affordable and has mostly everything you need.",4
2046,"I work for a company that has me on the road a lot, usually 50 - 75K a year. They let us choose what we want to drive, we buy it finance it and they give a very fair reimbursment for the miles. I bought the base GT with a few extras, keyless entry etc.. I have constantly gotten 32+ mpg on the highway with this car, I am also not afraid to pass with it. I have had ZERO problems with it. It had replaced a 2005 Elantra that was also a reliable car. This car ""feels"" safe you are fit and surrounded by its seat (I'm 6'1 and 190 lbs) I LOVE THE LOOKS, I LOVE THE FEEL (like a sports car) Plenty of back seat comfort (a note to GM) WHY KILL PONTIAC WHEN YOU FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT!!!!!",4
2047,"I have had the versa for 45 days. I love the way it drives its so quite and I love the cvt transmission. Traded my Honda Pilot to save money don't miss it much the Versa is a great car I would recommend it to anyone. So far I'm getting 28-29 mpg combined city & HWY, not as good as I expected but it only has 500 miles maybe it will get better mileage once its broken in. The keyless entry and bluetooth are worth the extra money. Great Car and very economical.",3
2048,We looked many different cars and the Mazda 3 is perfect. More opitions for less money and more room than most. Runs and rides like a sports car. And the 17 inch wheels and very stylish. We would advise anyone it get one over the Civic.,4
2049,"Certainly fun to drive with an excellent ride. Feels like a heavier vehicle with tremendous power (Hemi). 18 inch wheels offer nice handling and smooth ride. Lots of compliments on looks. Installed satellite (Sirius) at dealer. $700 compared to $185 from factory; so get it from factory if can. At 6' 3"", the door entry is small and seat is not wide for large behind. UConnect is awesome. Rear storage is small with 3rd row up. The lack of dual zone (driver/passenger) climate control is strange for vehicle that lists for $42,500; same comment for satellite. Interior is attractive, but leather is stiff. The small glove box on dash is annoying; center console is deep but awkward to access.",3
2050,"Very comfortable ride, steering is very user friendly, hugs the road.",3
2051,"Does everything well instead of compromising one performance area to excel in another. For example, corners as if on rails but preserves quiet, comfortable ride. The engine is smooth and quiet around town but makes operatic noises at the top of the rev range. This is the perfect luxury car for with enough confidence to eschew driving a visible status symbol. I drove Audis before they went upscale to compete directly with Mercedes and BMW. This Acura now fills that niche of artful, understated luxury that makes one look smart, not status conscious.",4
2052,"The Sonata is a very comfortable and roomy car. My husband is 6'4"" tall with very long legs and he is very comfortable driving it. I am averaging 32 miles a gallon. It is loaded with all the features I wanted at a reasonable price.",4
2053,Had the car 6 months now and still love everything about it. Great stereo and picks up speed very fast.,4
2054,"Defintitley notice the change going from a Forester (AWD) to the Vibe. It handles slick roads rather poorly, spinning the wheels as we turn corners on wet roads. But the mileage has ranged from 24 mpg city to 36 highway, doing better than our old Forester. Very cute and hip! Love the size and larger backseat.",3
2055,"This is a great performing car, but mine has been in the shop more than I have driven it. DSC and brake warning light is on constantly and DSC doesn't work. My windshield wipers also come on by themselves after I turn the car off which is very irritating. The dealer says the electronic control part is on ""national order"" status from Mini in Germany which leads me to believe that there must be a lot of other owners with the same problem. I'll have to wait and see if this car can outperform the Toyotas I have owned in the past. I also wish I had the leather seats - the ""leatherette"" plastic seats make you sweat like crazy and feel cheap relative to the cost of the car. Avoid them.",2
2056,"This is my second Xterra purchase. I bought a 2000 when they first came out. The changes and improvements are generous. The horse power increase is terrific. The A/C is improved and cargo area is easier to work with. I have had my new one since Feb 2008 and love it. The only change I did was buy an automatic, I have to deal with stop and go traffic in my commute.",3
2057,"We moved out of the domestic market in the 1990's for better quality, e.g. Nissan, Lexus. We wanted an AWD SUV and deduced that the quality imports had gotten out of our reach. We were really taken by the Enclave when we tested one out, so we ordered one. To our disappointment we have found that the wheels & hubs build up with snow, ice or mud which sets up an uncomfortable vibration Which can only be alleviated by washing the wheels thoroughly with a pressure washer. The Dealer tells us that this is a common issue in all the newer vehicles due to the open hub. I am suspicious that this is a run around. I also drive a 2008 Explorer at work that exhibits no such problem.",1
2058,I bought my 2007 Entourage in Spring of 2007. Automatic sliding doors have not worked properly since I bought it. Every time I bring it in for service I am told that nothing is wrong with the doors. Only other problem is the gas mileage averages about 17 MPG - not what I had expected. I want to get rid of it so bad - but the value has dropped so much - i can't get rid of it!!!,1
2059,"Before you buy a Nissan Sentra, Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic. You owe it to yourself to try out the Mazda3. The 3 handles great, incredible brakes! Very comfortable seats. Nice ride. Looks great! The manual mode in the auto shifter is a nice feature.",3
2060,"I leased a 2008 GTS in Dec 07, only to get rid of it shortly thereafter. The right front door rattled terribly and the dealership kept pretending not to hear it. They also refused to print work orders for my car. The windshield wipers went out on me in the pouring down rain for about 5 minutes on the highway during rush hour. The subwoofer in the trunk became dismounted within the first week of me having the car. Ended up getting an 08 Nissan Altima Coupe. I love it. Better quality car and comes with better customer service.",1
2061,"I purchased the Gl 450 4.7 Ltr about 1 year ago. It has spent over 2.5-3 months at the dealership while attempting to fix electronic problems. While driving the vehicle it would surge and then the warning lights would start lighting up like Christmas. The lights warned of the following failures ABS, Air bags to many to name they were all on. Then a big red box on the led would state drive to the dealership immediatly without shifting gears, how you do that in an automatic I'm still trying to figure out. We live in an isolated state with few roads and long distances between help. My faith in the Gl is gone! Hope no one else has experienced this. It still looks nice parked in my garage.",0
2062,"My E350 wagon was just broken in and it is such a smooth and refined family vehicle. The suspension is stiff, however the ride remains composed and luxurious. The car handles so well you forget the car weighs over 4000 lbs and it is actually fun to drive for a station wagon. It's not fast, however it has plenty of power for easy around town and highway driving. The driver's seat is so comfortable and piloting this Benz is truly a pleasure and a big step up from my previous Audi A6 Avant. It also gets decent 25 mpg while crusing at about 75-80 mph.(much better than EPA's 21 mpg estimate)",3
2063,"I have driven the CR-V 55,000 in a little over 2 years. This included about 3,000 miles of towing a trailer a max load. Other than routine maintenance (Oil, new tires, etc.) I haven't had any problems. MPG is about 28 highway / 21 in town. I wash and maintain the car regularly and it looks new. I use a leather conditioner on the seats every month. The leather in the driver seat is showing some minor wear. This car has been outstanding.",4
2064,"I needed a vehicle to replace my 2002 civic Si. The first time I drove the RDX I knew I wanted one. This thing is as much fun to drive as my Si. If you're looking for a small, quick, great handling SUV with some luxury, this is the vehicle for you.",4
2065,"Love the interior room, looks and over all choice of this car. It is noisy in regards to road noise and it is fairly uncomfortable on long trips. The 08 did get a bit of a blind spot when it gained the extra length. Good car in general. Great for hauling. Just totaled ours. Will be replacing it with something a little more comfortable.",3
2066,"Even after a few days there were problems with this SUV. Nothing really big but things detaching, safety belt not working (twice). This SUV is characterized by poor quality built and an overall blunt drive. The cargo space is quite big and the third row sat functional for kids. Burt for the price tag you should get better drive quality and certainly better build quality. The bluetooth function is very poor and does not synchronize with most phones. The dvd system does have some problems too. Poor fuel economy. Acura compares itself to BMW but they have a long, long way to go",1
2067,"I really wanted to own a car that was a practical family sedan but had the look and feel of something more. This car is fun to drive. It is quiet, comfortable and feels so solid. We have the LTZ V6 and it really doesn't lack any power.This car replaced a Chrysler 300M and I really don't notice a drop in quickness and power. I do notice this car handles very well and if you are not careful you will be speeding constantly. You really don't notice the road noise or engine rev. This car is really loaded with options for the price.",4
2068,"I am 41 yrs old and purchased my Civic 1 year ago yesterday and it is the best car I've owned. I drive 75 to 80 highway miles to work each day and truly enjoy the ride and definitely the fuel economy. I travel above the speed limit and still average above 32 mpg and when I decide to take it easy, it averages around 36-38 mpg. The Bridgestone tires are not as bad as some may believe, I have 26K on the factory set and have rotated at every oil change (every 8,200k) and they still look to have at least 50% tread remaining. The 1.8 L engine provides great economy, a quiet ride and will surprise you on the open road as to how fast you approach that third digit on the speedometer.",4
2069,"I only have about 500 miles on the car and so far I love it but it is a rattle trap with a lot of unnecessary noises from interior of car. My seatbelt squeaks, I have several rattles coming from headliner. On the positive side, this car is a beast!!! I cannot say enough about how fast this thing is! I hope the dealership can iron out my compaints and let me love this car!!",3
2070,My family loves this Suburban. The space is comfortable and they love the DVD player and the radio. The fact that we can listen to different things at the same time.,3
2071,"test drove the 2007 bmw 328i, audi a4 (2.0t and 3.2), mazdaspeed6, lexus is250. spent the last 5 years driving a 2001 vw jetta wolfsburg with Upsolute chip. the g35s 6mt i picked up a month ago easily outperformed all of them. full of gadgets (i'm a sucker for techy gadgets and gimmicks). perfect balance of sport, luxury, and technology. no other car can hang with the bang for the buck and the only one in its league performance wise is the bmw 335i for an additional $10k. sorry lexus is350, if you're automatic only you are disqualified from serious sports sedan contention. otherwise is350 would also be in this top 3, although for $5k more than the infiniti.",4
2072,"Turned in my 2006 Ford Explorer, a great riding vehicle with many features that fell short on interior comfort and visibility. The Highlander is spacious and comfortable with excellent visibility in most areas.",3
2073,"One of the best handling vehicles I've ever owned. Feels much more like a sedan than an SUV (once it gets rolling). Averaging about 20 MPG, feels like less since the tank is relatively small. Stereo is very good. Oil changes are expensive since it requires synthetic oil.",3
2074,This is really a good car. Very good gas mileage on the I4 (27 mph) mixed driving. Fit and finish is excellent and beats Detroit models costing more. Holds the road like glue. Very responsive for a 4. Driver protection program beats the industry. Visibility is outstanding.,3
2075,I had to give up my Suburban for a more economical vehicle and plus a lower monthly payment. Caliber was not my first choice but my only choice cuz the dealership were out of vehicles due to the clunkers for cash. I have been driving this vehicle for a few days and it is not no bad it does have room for our two kids and a nice family vehicle.,3
2076,"I transitioned from a basic, bare-bones Toyota Echo to the 2008 Honda Fit--what a difference. MPG is less than I was used to, but this is much more of a car and well worth the slight decrease in mileage. This car is fun and solid to drive; pickup is great, especially for a car with such little horsepower, and the car is very comfortable on long road trips. The sport model is worth the higher price, since those little luxuries all factor into the enjoyment of driving this car.",3
2077,"I had an 02 Honda Accord, 4 cyl., and wanted better mileage. I did a lot of research, and didn't find a better price for the mileage. I've only had it 3 days now, but I love the car. Small tweaks to the interior (longer arm rest/center console, and someplace to rest a cell phone) would be great. My only complaint in the rear view mirror. I'm 5'9"", and the mirror is right in my line of vision for intersection traffic. I'm going to have my dealer move it up. Great ride, I have no problem with road noise.",3
2078,"Had the car a couple of weeks and put 600 miles on it. It's a very comfortable car, even the 3.5 has more than adequate power, I've never felt like I had to have more. I've only used regular gas so far and gotten 28 MPG. Controls are all logical. I got the leather package and seats are comfortable but could use more side support. Great room up front, but lacking a bit in rear leg room for as big as the car is. My only beef is the paint finish - the hood has 2 big ""blotches"" - dealer noted it and offered to repaint under warranty, but something as bad as that should have never made it out of the factory.",3
2079,"I'm very happy with our purchase. Yes, mileage is not that great, but it's still better than my truck, and there's more horsepower too. My lone complaint is that it's primarily my wife's daily driver and not mine! But that's hardly Infiniti's fault.",3
2080,"Short review.... I get 26.5 mpg overall mpg, posted seems low. And I go pretty fast. Bose stereo is a waste of money. Basic system is fine, and the OEM speakers they use are very good--even if you replace the head unit, stock speakers are solid. Seems Bose didn't tune the system because it rattles terribly. I'm an audio dood; Bose are clown shoes. A safety recall on engine mount, an ""unofficial"" recall on d-link in rear end, and a throttle failure in first year. Occasionally belches smoke. Hmm. Interior design is nice. Lots of rattles. Good cargo capacity. More fun than the WRX, feels faster, snappier brakes. Clutch is sticky and 'sudden'. Best 'fast' car for the money, by far",3
2081,"Having leased over 4 Jeep Grand Cherokee's in the past 9 years, I find driving this vehicle extremely exhilerating besides, I have only had it for a week. Spending time at the pump was never an issue because I was always averaging 16 miles per gallon in the other vehicles. The navigation system is a great and sharp. I have not tried the TV in the back because I'm usually driving the vehicle.",3
2082,"after taking it for off road for the first time even it was smooth ride on sand the steering axcel became noisy, they fixed it, now it came again, i think it is a week point in it. other than that every thing looks good. performace is good, it was stable even on 200 km/h i dont regret having it",3
2083,"I love this vehicle! Plenty of head and leg room! My kids can stand up in the back without touching their heads to the ceiling! Lots of room! This vehicle handles really well around corners and into small parking spots. Cargo room, you can get lots of stuff back there. We bought a liner for in the back. If there would be any spills then it stays on the liner and not in the Nitro! The radio/satellite/CD have great sound and are centrally located and easy to reach. Comfortable seats. The exterior is very impressive! You get lots of looks at it and people asking what kind of vehicle is that??? LOVE IT!",4
2084,"I like the car overall. I was driving a 1995 Avalon, so replacing my car is a big deal. Going from a V6 to a V4 takes some getting used to. I think the overdrive gear is too low. On cruise control over a minor hill, the car downshifts (my Avalon NEVER did that.) I think they put a low gear for more fuel economy, but I would sure like an override to the constant down shifting. The car is a real head turner, I love the styling. The controls are neatly placed. The audio system has a jack for my portable tape player. I wish the audio system had both CD and cassette. Also, I am pleased that the car warms up fast in the morning (how did they do that?)",3
2085,"The Veracruz is a very quiet smooth riding suv with very good quality, it has many extra features for the money. The only problem I have with the Veracruz is the gas mileage, it is less than I expected.",3
2086,Have two 2007 Honda Civics. They run great and get great mileage. The only drawbacks are the front windshield is impossible to clean as the dash barely leaves any room on the driver side. The head restraints can be irritating at first if you lean back in the seat. After a month of constantly bumping the back of your head you learn to sit up straight.The car is great around town but is not the most comfortable on long trips. Car has been wonderful other than that.,3
2087,I am a real shopper and the T&C Touring was by far the best choice between the Sienna and the Odessy. The T&C had the best layout and seating plus the stow and go is great. I have had zero problems with this van and I have had it for a year now. The traction control works very well in snow. I recommend this vehicle.,4
2088,"The transmission shifts fine. I'm getting 21 MPH highway during sea level driving, reduced some at elevation.",3
2089,This is my forth Audi. I've had two 5000's an A6 quattro and now this 2008 A3 2.0T 6A. My wife drives it most of the time. We both love it. Have 11700 miles on it. No trouble at all. I highly recommend the ca.,4
2090,"We had done our research and were waiting for the Fit to become available. One drive was all it took to confirm that it was well built, great looking, roomy and fun to drive. It has nearly the leg room of our '03 Element EX and a phenomenal amount of room overall. I am 6'4"" and can actually use the back seat comfortably with the front seat slid all the way back. The only things missing as options are a satellite radio and a moon/sun roof. The Fit really wants to get up and go; it's a blast to drive. It feels peppier and bigger than the Civic. It has side curtain airbags and numerous other safety features. I expect reliability to be typical Honda: excellent. Try one & you're hooked!",4
2091,"Great driving truck with secure feel on the road. The interior is as confortable as possible, without leather. 20 inch wheels give it height and attitude. Hemi feels good under the foot and brakes stop it on a dime.",3
2092,This is a beautiful car! My husband bought it for me as a gift but I think he really bought it for himself as he cannot stop raving about it. I chose the bluestone color which clearly was worth the wait. Can't wait until the weather warms up so I can really have some fun!,4
2093,"I was looking for a new car for a good while. I was about to get the new Lexus ISF but then I came across the C63. Daammmmmm. First of all it has a very clean look. The exterior has a good blend of sporty and luxurious. The interior is also very nice. A very clean and luxurious look. However I'm not too sure about the bucket seats. Though the leather is absolutely gorgeous, I feel the seats could have been more comfortable. There ok though, some people really like them. The best part is the engine. It has superpowers.",3
2094,This is our 4th Honda and our 2nd Odyssey and every generation gets better. The van is fun to drive. I love the car-like handling and responsiveness. It has plenty of power for pickup. There is ample of room for 6 adults. Middle 2nd and 3rd row seats are sized for kids only. I have had my new 2008 Odyssey for 2 months now and it has developed one problem. The right sliding door's opened window safety feature which keeps the door from sliding all the way became engaged even when the window is closed which is keeping the door from opening all the way. I'll be taking it to the dealer for repair. The mileage is close to 13 in the city and 20 on the hwy; less than what the window sticker states.,3
2095,"The power windows are too slow. The AC system modulates too frequently and never seems to get cold. Gas mileage is not that good. However, the fun to drive, especially for a 4 banger, is pretty decent.",3
2096,"This car is so good, I wouldn't want to know the person dissatisfied with it. Too spoiled. Excellent reliability. Excellent safety. Excellent road holding in bad weather. The quietest car I've ever experienced. Excellent stereo. Comfortable seats for me. Pleasant styling. Like most Acuras, will probably look fine in 10 years. Cadillacs and BMWs will probably look silly/dated. The only thing you get in 2009 is an ugly restyling, 10 more hp and a significant loss in economy. 2008 is a optimal year. It doesn't feel like a toss around car. Too heavy. Reasonable back seat. Everything about it inspires confidence: quality, road manners, rubber on the road, balance. It does everything well",4
2097,"We bought this car for my wife (but of course I had to get it with all of the toys for me). We looked at the GMC Acadia, Mazda CX-9, and the Toyota Highlander. None of the above really compared to the highlander in terms of style, options, and reliability. Initially we were not considering a hybrid, but one came to the lot in our area. With gas now approach $3.50 a gallon, I am beginning to think we made a good decision. With our 3rd tank of gas, we are averaging about 26.2 mpg. This should improve as we break in the engine. The navigation takes a bit of practice to master, but after taking one evening to sit down and learn it, it is quite simple.",3
2098,"I just got this car last week, and I love it. I had a van and was worried that it would be hard to adjust to a smaller vehicle, but it wasn't. The Versa has a lot of head room and driver and passengers sit up fairly high. There is a lot of room in this little car. And I love the way it looks. It drives nicely and has a lot of pep, too. I haven't had it long enough to check if the mileage is as advertised, but I'm sure it'll be better than the van.",3
2099,"Great car that is fun and safe to drive. I get between 29-30 mpg with it in mixed driving. Good access in the back to carry loads. Had a WRX before that was fun, but had a harsh ride and was not as stable in adverse winter conditions. This car has plenty of pep.",3
2100,"This is my third go-round w/ the Wrangler. I have owned a '95 YJ (College), an '03 TJ(first married), and have now settled into the 4dr JK (w/children). The new 4 doors are functional with the new additions to my family and I do not have to sacrifice driving a cool vehicle. This is not a speed machine by any means, yet is fully functional for on road usage and the offroad capabilities speak for itself. The gas milage is fair given the ride height and lack of aerodynamics. If you own one of these you are in the club. If you want an Escalade experience when driving then keep shopping.",3
2101,"I should preface by saying that I have only had the car for a few weeks, so perhaps the problems have not had time to make themselves apparent. But so far, this car is unbelievable for the price! The handling on the car is as good as foreign made cars (this is in fact my first American car and I can barely tell the difference). It's the perfect car for the city, and has more than enough pop for long highway drives. Interrior features are awesome, and it looks great from the outside with a spoiler.",3
2102,"After a quick 2k miles in less than 2 weeks we love it.Turned in an 05 Grand Cherokee lease. Bought Sport E25 5spd,17"" rims heated seats. Great Great Mileage (27+,compared to 17-18 mpg)). Very comfortable, as nice if not better than the grand, little smaller, nicer handling and driving, found the 5 speed to have plenty of power. True 4x4 will be nice for upstate NY. Front seat folds flat for super storage if needed (great option) patriot really is impressive. I like the interior (despite what the big boys say) this is the 6th Jeep we have owned. We highly recommend the patriot. Shop at least 2 dealers. We stepped down in price but gained every way imaginable. Gas gas gas",4
2103,"This is my second Avalon and both have been wonderful cars, the first got crashed, although both have been wonderful cars. I just took a trip to the Grand Canyon from southern CA, and averaged 31.7 MPG with the cruise control set at 70 MPH. I have not taken a trip that I have attained less than 29 MPG. This is a well engineered car great handling and comfort, lots of luggage space. This car pretty much has it all. I would highly recommend it to anyone.",4
2104,"This car is nice, comfortable, run smart and very smooth. The fuel economy is also very competitive. My wife is so happy and loves it. Wise choice!",4
2105,"I work for a fleet leasing company and have driven many domestic and foreign vehicles.In most cases the Japanese vehicles out drive and out last most domestic vehicles.In recent years I've seen Ford put together some quality products Fusion, Taurus. Now GM is following suit with the new Malibu. Build quility is definitely above the Camry and design is also well ahead of most competition.If one thing stands out it's how quiet the cabin is. The 6 cylinder engine is smooth and powerful and the paddle shifters work well holding gears without the kicking down in most cases.Interior room is good still a little smaller inside than Fusion or Camry however much nicer layout. All and all nice car",3
2106,"I have been wanting a Civic Si since before I can remember. Now that I have one, I wish I could return it. It feels like a Cadillac with 2 doors and a 4 cylinder engine. That is, it doesn't feel fast, the suspension is terrible, it never feels comfortable, and I just can't find a good seat position. The cabin feels claustrophobic and cramped and I am not a large person (5'5""). If I could return it, I would. I don't think I'll be keeping this car much longer and will take my losses. I'll give 6 months max. Completely disappointed. Depressed and dissatisfied. I'll probably never get myself to buy another Honda again.",0
2107,"I thought this was my dream car. Traded in a 2001 Nissan Altima. (Miss it) I bought this car on Monday and it's been in the shop since Wednesday. Car broke down on my way to work, once I got it started again, engine light came on, took it to dealership and they couldn't duplicate problem. Broke down again the next day, on my way to work, car still in shop. They state it won't be fixed until Monday or Tuesday, have to install a a whole new assembly? Refuse to give me money back, no offer of another car to made good on bad Civic. First new car in 20 years and thought Honda was the best. The exterior is awesome, love the dash. Can't comment on mpg, haven't drove it or had it long enough to know",1
2108,"I traded in a Dodge gas hog truck. I love the new larger 2007 CR-V. I am six feet tall, and I have plenty of room. I am averaging 23 mpg with 90% city 10% freeway. It drives sooo easy. Parks easy. I bought the EX. I believe the little extra money for the EX was worth it. I am adding the iPod music link this week. I tried the Kias. No comparison. Honda's quality is awesome.",4
2109,"I have a little over 9000 miles on my Fit, and I still look forward to driving it. I'm averaging 34 mpg. It's amazing how much stuff you can squeeze into this car if you try, and rearranging the seats is simple. I had to add a seat cover with a bit of extra padding to keep from getting a backache, but I still wouldn't trade this car for anything. It looks tiny from the outside, but is amazingly roomy inside.",3
2110,"I have the Sport model. Exciting car to drive with all the extras that a driver could desire. I don't find the control center confusing, but rather find it loaded with useful features. I push the car hard on winding roads and I find it very responsive and easy to handle. (It compares favorable to BMWs I owned in the past.) The gas mileage is not good, but that is the only disappointment (especially when premium hit $4.00 in Santa Barbara.) All together, I highly reccomend this reasonable priced luxury sport sedan.",3
2111,"Just bought this car new a week ago. Not many miles driven yet but so far the car has met/exceeded expectations. It's quiet in town and on the highway, even at 70/80 mph with only minor wind noise from the outside mirrors, a big improvement over my last car. Transmission is very smooth and the powertrain combination gives excellent performance on hills. Ride is comfortable but the driver seat needs an extra inch or two of seat cushion to give better thigh support for longer trips. I looked at the Civic and Nissan Sentra and Versa but dollar for dollar, the Optima was a no brainer, lot's of bang for the buck. I'll give another rating after I put more miles on the car.",3
2112,"This is my first brand new car and I adore it. My brother has a BMW X5 and I see no difference in the performance, build and looks. Great buy. Recommended 5 out of 5.",4
2113,Great car. Love the copper/tan combination real sharp. First time convertible for us and we are very pleased.,4
2114,Very nice car. I had a E55 prior to this car and it was also very nice. I did like the twin turbo in my e55 but I like the seven speed transmission quite a bit better than my old car. Plenty of power but gas mileage is terrible. All in all a great car.,3
2115,"Was considering several cars like Mercedes C350, E350, Lexus GS350, Infiniti G35, BMW 528i sport. After driving all of them, the 535i with sport, premium, navi, xenon blew them all away. Great transmission with 2 sport modes and paddle shifters. Car is glued to the road. Active suspension almost eliminates body roll. IDrive is functional just takes some time to learn all the menus. Picks up speed instantly, no turbo lag. Very fun to drive. My 1st BMW and now I know why its called ultimate driving machine. Other premium brands don't come close in road feeling.",4
2116,"We traded a 2005 Pathfinder with a 4.0L engine. This has more power, drives and handles better and is more comfortable. Even the third row is bigger than the Pathfinder. Overall fit and finish is excellent. We were concerned about going from a full frame truck to the uni-body but after driving it for a month, we made the right choice.",4
2117,"This is my first time owning a Sonata by Hyundai, I've owned a lot of cars over the years, and I have to say that this car rides smoother than any 4 cyl I've ever owned, the ride is smooth pick- up is great the trunk is very large. the styling is great ive added the all weather floor mats and the full bra, and the window vent covers it all looks great on the polar white. the fuel mileage is great for this size of car 26 in the city so far and haven't taken it on the highway yet. XM is great love the 6 speakers and sound. Saved thousands of dollars compared to the Honda and Toyota's.",4
2118,"I just got this car less than a week ago. This car is sweet, love to rev it over 6000 rpm where the vtec kicks in. Great interior and very roomy for a car of its size. My wife really wants to learn to drive stick now that I have this. My 6 month old's car seat fits easliy in the back where as in the coupe it was a hassle.",3
2119,"I'd been with my car barely a month, but it had been an incredible experience. The ride, the interior comfort plus the looks of the car are second to none. The engine response it fantastic, plenty of power to move the big body.",3
2120,"Had this vehicle for nearly 1 year and I'm just amazed how fun it is. When I'm in the feeling for some sporty driving, I push the ""M"" button on the center mount. I pretend the ""M"" button is from the BMW M3. This is my M3. When I drive to Vegas, I can easily achieve 120MPH and keep it there with little to no trouble. When driving in town, I try to challenge myself. When I accelerate, I try and keep the RPM below 2000RPM. Once I hit about 10 or 15MPH, the RPM drops and I push a little more on the accelerator and move quicker all the while keeping the RPM under 2000 and the gas mileage up. Opted for the keyless and sound pack. The stereo is unbelievable.",4
2121,"The Chevy Equinox is a true competitor against the RAV4 and Santa Fe. I test drove both, and the Equinox is the best one. My decision made up of all the nice features the Equinox offers at a lower price than both the Santa Fe and RAV4. Also, the styling is so much better than the other two. The Equinox has a pretty quiet engine, it can accelerate quickly and performs well. The gas mileage is good considering its size. The new and improved 2007 interior is better than the '06 one. The truck is the biggest, inside/out, compared to the Santa Fe and RAV4. Even the stock sound system is the best. Overall, the car is fun to drive and I am happy with my purchase. This truck rocks!",4
2122,"There's nothing bad to say. I'm getting great gas mileage for an SUV, 24-32 mpg. You have to pay attention to your driving style to get it though, no fast accelerating, etc. It handles really well for you non-sports car drivers. It's easy to drive, fun and very comfortable. Tons of room, head and legs, unless you are 6-2 and try to fit in the third row, although that still was better than any small car backseat I've been stuffed in. The standard features with the base model are good enough although mine came with the popular plus package which came with more features than I would have asked for. This vehicle was simply better than anything else I researched and/or test drove.",4
2123,"I love Mazda vehicles to begin with. They are one of the few car manufacturers that actually build 99% of their cars in Japan. The quality shows. I was very skeptical about a 4cyl. engine with an automactic. The 2.3L with the 5 speed auto is an absolute blast to drive. The 6 speed Miata was a blast to drive, but try commuting 70+ miles a day in LA's freeway traffic. The fit and finish is s good as any BMW 3 series, and the performance will make you wonder why you need to spend an extra 15K on a Bimmer. I have owned them as well. First thing I did after I had 1500 miles was change the oil to Royal Purple, K&N oil filter and K&N air filter. I know the car doesn't need this.",4
2124,"I'm a new owner. I've heard a lot of positive things about the car before. Now, I can say that it's true. There's a lot of power, handles well, and a very practical vehicle. My wife and daughter love it too.",3
2125,"We just leased an ES 350 coming out of a Acura TL. We have found the electronics, including radio and bluetooth to be inferior to the TL. Disappointing. Also some of the features like keyfob by driver (1 or 2) is not available on ES 350 as it is on TL. Very disappointing that satellite radio was not included nor did the dealers stock cars with the option. Had to have dealer add satellite radio at an exorbitant price. Acura TL has this standard. A car in this price range should have an excellent radio; excellent bluetooth; and include satellite radio. Could be the first and last Lexus.",1
2126,"I definitely am satisfied with the performence of my Civic on wet, dry, and mountain roads. I was very disturbed by the lack of control I had of the vehicle on ice and snow. With front wheel drive, I expected better than what I got but at 10-15 mph the car would not run straight while other vehicles were passing me at twice my speed. I will not be taking this vehicle into snow country again. Road noise is a bit excessive and the transmission is suprisingly rough. Fuel economy is excellent. Handling on dry and even wet roads is exceptional, but it cannot hold its own on ice.",2
2127,"This is my first Z and I'm pleased to say that everything about the Z legend is true. The newest VQ35HR engine has legendary horsepower and torque, mated with the 5sp Automatic for legendary reliability, the sound of the exhaust is addictive, the design is an instant classic. Very respectable MPG for a little monster car like this. And cool tuned suspension/ride for the balance between road handling and comfort. Everything I was hoping for and a lot more.",4
2128,"The new Corvette Z06 is the fastest car I have ever driven. Its heart stopping acceleration is astonishing! I found that the 6 speed gear box feel like it belongs in a truck. The clutch is also very hard to push and you will get a sore leg after awhile. Otherwise...I loveit! The exhaust sounds like the good old American muscle that I have been used to. Awesome brakes, handling is great, and most of all, great engine! The car turns heads because of its awsome design. My car is victory red. Red looks the best on this car. Fun car to drive. There is no car on the road that even think of racing you and your car, you look at them and laugh. The best thing is...power!",4
2129,"For the money it is the best midsize crossover vehicle period. Easy entry exit. I have a bad lower back. Great view when driving. Very comfortable. A lot of room. Great engine, transmission, brakes. Prefer old style steering. Electric steering is kind of numb, vague. Not good road feel like traditional steering. Would like to see 6 speed automatic and engine with more horsepower and torque. I get a lot of compliments. Mine is ruby red.",4
2130,It is really fun to drive! This is unusual for an SUV (especially for a Diesel). The engine gives good low and mid range power and acceleration and is smooth and quiet. The mileage has been better than advertised. The iPod integration is nice.,4
2131,I wanted to write this review due to the fact that people have complained about this lovely car a lot. I got a 08 Chevy Aveo because I needed something better for my job and this car fit perfectly. No it doesn't have the power of a Corvette but if I wanted the power of a Corvette I would have bought one! This car has been getting me from point A to point be and this is a nice family car but sporty looking too!,3
2132,"Have had mine since Nov 2006. Absolutely love it! I would not hesitate to recommend to anybody. Most comfortable ride of any car I have owned. The only thing is, it's so popular around here I see myself coming and going all day long!",4
2133,I've owned 2 Chevys and was headed towards an F-150 when I saw a review on the Tundra. I was upgrading to a 4 door and was looking for a family adventure vehicle with lots of space and the ability to get our gear in to the mountains. I drove the Crewmax Limited and bought it on the spot. The engine and transmission are powerful and silky smooth. The TRD package has everything you need to feel secure off road. The seating is extremely comfortable which was a major selling point and the cabin is almost dead quiet.This is a serious truck without a bone jaring truck feel. I've talked to several other serious truck users who have owned every brand.They agree the Tundra is the best they have owned,4
2134,"I traded my ideal vehicle, a Jeep Grand Cherokee, due to rising gas prices and mileage on the vehicle. This is my first Honda and my first brand new car purchase. I test drove a lot of subcompact cars before deciding on the Civic. All the others gave me the feeling that I was giving up a quality vehicle for a lesser one. I didn't feel that with the Civic. I commute close to 2 hours round trip 6 days a week. My gas bill has been literally cut in half with this car. It's fun to drive, sporty, and solidly built. I like the 5-speed automatic transmission as it adds to the driving experience. The ride is comfortable, too. Overall, it's a great value!",4
2135,"I drove my Mustang from California to Boston, and once winter hit knew that I needed a new car. I was looking at a lot of options, and then someone suggested looking at a Subaru. I LOVE this car! It's sporty enough for me, yet at the same time provides the safety and comfort of a luxury car twice it's price. The AWD is second to none, and the ride is unbelievably smooth. Everybody who asks me about this car is shocked to find out it's not a 40k+ luxury car. It's THAT eye-catching! Subaru has found itself a new loyal customer!",4
2136,"After many Mercedes I believe that this is the best overall package. A great overall balance of ride, handling and luxury. Many people comment on the lack of leather upolstery as standard, but my experience with the MB Tex has been much better durability and appearance after several years of use. I would recommend the P2 package. You will really appreciate the visibility afforded by the Bi-Xenon headlamps. Once you have purchased Mercedes no other vehicle will do.",4
2137,"We ordered our van and it's been down hill every since. The van is beautiful inside and out, with many extras. Unfortunately we also have a van that engine brakes everytime we take our foot off of the gas. We brought it back 2 days after purchasing and 7 weeks later we are still getting the run around. This is my first new vehicle and I am terribly disappointed with this. The service manager and the district manager are making us wait further so that he can test drive the van. This problem is evident with just the feel of the vehicle and also is visible on the tach... the transmission is not releasing. Poor service!",1
2138,"With just 200 miles on the odometer, this car already says it all, power, comfort, and agility. There are probably other cars with more of each, but this one has a nice balance of all three. The Harmon Kardon sound system is worth the upgrade. However, the sound from the engine is even better. Just wish it had ""real"" fuel and temp gauges.",3
2139,"I just bought this little car in order to make little trips into town. I needed something that was easy on gas. After looking at what's on the market in the 19 to 22 thousand dollar range there was only one choice. The Rabbit is very well built, fun and easy to drive. I was really impressed by the quality and the number of options that came standard. This is a powerful little machine. It tops the market, in other words you get more for your dollar with the VW rabbit than any other car in the price range and above.",4
2140,"Traded in my 04 545i for the new 535i. Wow! I can't say enough about how much they have improved this model. It is faster, quieter, smoother, and handles better than my 545, for less money! BMW has also made subtle changes to the interior that make the car feel more luxurious (more wood and leather in the right places). I would highly recommend this car.",4
2141,"I have over 3000 kms. on it and love it more every day. This is my 6th car (4th VW) and is my favorite by far. I love the handling, acceleration, looks, interior, and especially how quiet it is. It has tons of room inside and I really like how everything is laid out inside. I actually like the cruise on the stick and it is very easy to use (unlike previous Jetta models). It makes for a cleaner looking steering wheel. I have had absolutely no problems so far. It is built like a tank.",4
2142,I can't say enough about this car. The fit and finish are 2nd to none. I love the Burl Walnut wood. The manager explained the high strength low alloy steel that Mercedes is famous for. This gives the car a secure heavy feel for the road and is rated extremely high in crash tests. I drove the V-6 and was impressed with th 268 horsepower but fell in love with the V-8...wow! Air conditioned/heated seats are a nice addition to the soft leather. This car was leased and I must say there is a good chance I'll buy this car when the lease is over.,4
2143,"This is the very first brand new vehilce purchase I have ever made. I am quite disappointed. The exterior paint is ""cheap & sensitive"" (scratches down to the metal extremely easily, I have had to pay for protectant because of bird droppings marking it). The interior ""plastic"" (dash, doors)scratch extremely easily, and the upholstery snags like mad as well. The little windows on the front sides create blind spots. The window sticker when I bought it said avg mpg 30 highway and I have not ever gotten above 25-26mpg. Small gas tank. Cruise control is not standard neither are arm rests. Not terribly comfortable. Hard to handle in strong winds. Back seat not much leg room. Not ""family"" car",1
2144,"It's wonderful! I have a 75 mile a day commute on a very winding road. This car makes the trip a lot of fun. It handles like a dream. I average 45 mpg, sometimes more, sometimes less depending on driving conditions, but I haven't gotten less than 41. The controls did take some getting used to, but that's just one more thing that makes this car unique. It is surprisingly roomy. I got a pretty basic model and it is still loaded with lots of nice features that most other cars only offer as ""added features"". I bought this car just as a work car that would be cheap on gas, but its so fun to drive that I drive it everywhere. My other vehicles are just collecting dust.",4
2145,"What a fun car. Excellent compromise of cost, utility and fun. Great handling, good comfort, good engine performance. Best fun per dollar I've ever had in a car. Only thing I don't like is the tendency of the engine to hold up revs when off-throttle while shifting.",3
2146,For the money this is hands down the best car I could have chose. Everyone I have drove in this car has been impressed with its get up and go as well as its handling. No one can believe that it is a Civic. I wanted something that was economical but sporty. Originally I was going to purchase the coupe but after seeing the sedan I had to choose it. The sedan does not lose any performance to the coupe yet makes it easier to get things in and out of the back seat. I am more than pleased with my choice.,4
2147,"This is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned and the visibility is great. The interior upgrade for this year is very evident. I'm only getting about 16 mpg but the model is the AWD version so I expect it to be less. Early on it leaked oil due to a faulty galley plug, which was replaced under warranty. Two rear fender well pieces became delaminated/discolored and had to be replaced under warranty, but I don't think the color (Gold Mist) was matched properly. I'm taking it to an independent body shop for a second opinion. If I am wrong, that will be the end of it. If not, it will be going back to the dealership.",2
2148,"We have two toddlers and a teenager and we were looking for a vehicle that accomodated the family and all our things. We have been resisting the minivan market, but the Family Room on Wheels commercial made us test drive the T&C. We ended up buying it and absolutely love it. The toddlers are disappointed when they have to ride with me in my Tahoe. The ride is great, it rides like a car with minimal interior noise and an overall smooth ride. The seats are comfortable and the features are endless. We have the dark blue with cream interior which looks great and the amount of chrome outside really makes the colors pop. Here goes...I love my minivan!",4
2149,"I really like this car. It came with pkg.#2 and the communication pkg - plus iPod connection. Prior to this, I owned a 2003 BMW 325xi. The Benz offers a larger, smoother ride and looks sharp. I've driven 1000 miles and like it more and more each day.",3
2150,"The car is simply awesome. Quiet, luxurious, fun to drive. GM has finally decided to compete with Japan and Europe. The car is not perfect, but comes close. I test drove Acura MDX, BMW X5, Volvo C70, Mercedes ML, Lexus RX and Buick won out. The other cars were nice, but not as well thought out and not even close when it comes to value. I traded in my Lincoln Aviator. I was hesitant about buying another domestic car because I have been disappointed on the two that i owned. The Enclave has a generous warranty that should cover most problems.",3
2151,"I'm one of the unlucky few (or many) with the 5.7 engine trouble. I hope Toyota recalls this engine. I feel misled by Edmunds.com for raving about this truck almost guaranteeing reliability because it's a Toyota. Guess what. Toyota reliability is overated, now I know. I need to mention that this truck left me stranded out on the freeway. I had to wait 4 hours for a tow truck.",1
2152,"My family & I have had this vehicle for a year now w/over 15,000 miles & have traveled a lot since then. So far, we have not encountered any ""major"" problems that other people have stated in there reviews. I spoke w/a Hyundai mechanic & he told me that this is a heavy vehicle w/a 3.8 Liter V6 engine. So of course the gas mileage is not great. Also a vehicle is considered broken in after 35-50,000 miles & that is when you will start having better gas mileage. But, it also depends on your driving style and terrain as well. My advice, save your money & stick w/a basic van. After reading other reviews, owners of vans w/more amenities seem to have more problems than others,ie. power doors 4 example.",2
2153,"I just got my new Prius with packages, and #2 It is one great car. Chances the way you drive. The Prius handles very well and gets great MPG. It has real good pick up on the interstate. There is ample room in the hatch back. I am sure glad I got this car with gas going out of sight.",3
2154,"I got this car six weeks ago, and it has been the best car I drive so far. I traded it in for a C-230 and theres a lot of difference between them. I got it black on black, and it looks clean, a lot of people had told me ""that car looks beautiful"" and I really think so.",4
2155,"I got a 2007 Honda Civic a few months ago, and I really have liked it so far. It's reliable, performs well, fun to drive, and has good fuel economy.",3
2156,"My Kia Rio5 has been in the shop this past month 5 times for the same issue! Kia will only approve the minimal amount of repairs and has yet to fix my vehicle. For the last month, I have been without my car and after the engine and oxygen sensor has been replaced, the vehicle is still broken. What does Kia say??? Nothing. They will not return my phone calls. Whats the use of a 10 year/100,000 mile warranty, if Kia will not make good on it! Don't buy Kia! The cars are cute and fuel efficient, but not dependable and Kia does not stand behind their product!",1
2157,"The car is fun to drive and cost less than many of the roadsters out there. Always getting attention, even from Mercedes SL500 owners. Very comfortable even for long drives. Exceptional detail for the price and Saturn.",3
2158,"A follow-up review from our first month of ownership. My wife and I bought the van for long trips. Using 91 octane at 60-65 mph we average 27-28 MPG. Mileage in town 21 MPG using a light foot on the accelerator. Combined mileage about 22-23. Very comfortable on long trips. Navi great, seats great, maneuverability great for van, entry/exit seat height great, noise control OK, front suspension OK, mileage better than SUV, exterior looks great, gauge legibility great, headlight projection great, dash design dated (think JDM), interior plastic too cheap. Upgrade the 2010 interior plastic to match the 2009 Pilot.",3
2159,In California I drove in more stop and go traffic and my mileage was 37 mpg on trips 40. Now living in Northwest and mpg has been 40 all the time until they just changed to the summer gas mixture. I have lost 1 to 2 mpg. A relative owns a 2005 Prius and she loses 2 mpg each summer also in Calif driving. It does not handle well in the snow if there is ice the traction control kicks in as soon as you start to slip so you can't use the gas to try and get out of it. It will need snow tires this next summer.,2
2160,"I've owned the new Malibu for a full year now and I am still completely satisfied. Drives great, looks great and I have not found anything I don't love about it. The interior is awesome and the ride is very smooth. A year later and I still look forward to driving this car everyday. I don't think I have ever been this satified with a purchase. Definitely worth every dime I paid for it and then some.",4
2161,"I love this car!! I am a sales rep and drive it a lot, and extremely hard. I actually got 38.5 MPG at 60 mph on the freeway during break in. But after break in I began to drive it like I stole it and still avg 22.5 mpg with 50/50 miles around town and highway, and hitting 6000 rpm all the time. The 09 has stiffer springs and 40 more BHP. I think with the 09, there's no reason to buy an STI unless you want to go to jail. The best bang for the buck out there!",4
2162,"I love the exterior design and engine of the RAV4, but if you are expecting typical Toyota quality the interior of the RAV4 will disappoint. I have had to have parts of the dash replaced as pieces did not fit securely and rattled, in fact lots of squeaks, creaks and rattles in interior. Many parts of the interior just feel like they don't fit together or are loose. Feel stuck with the RAV4 rather than loving it. Though it is small, tall drivers will fit comfortably. Lots of storage spaces in both front and rear.",2
2163,"This car is nothing but fun. No problems with it at all. Recalls obviously but other then that no other repairs. Gas milage is surprisingly well. Great hauling vehicle. Lots of jump off dead starts, take any little 4 cylinder car anyday.",3
2164,"The 08 Grand Cherokee Laredo equipeed with the 26X package has a nice ride and an exceptionally high build quality. No squeeks, no rattles and the fit of parts is virtually perfect. Gas mileage around town has been 15.2 mpg.",3
2165,"when I first saw the car , I was impressed by the beautiful exterior design. I got mine with the front under spoiler and fog lights and it looks very aggressive. I also got the interior panel trim which makes a big difference over stock. The car is lots of fun to drive. My only complaint is that it needs more power. In order to get those 197 horses you need to push the engine over 7000 rpm, which I think it's not healthy for the engine. In conclusion it's a great buy just needs more power. Turbo or supercharger will be nice.",3
2166,"I've owned at least 6 Jeeps (new and used) in the last 10 years. This Jeep is a blast to drive (it's loaded with all the features you could ask for). Best mileage to date was 32 mpg (highway) and averaging 25 mpg in the city. Bought mine 2 1/2 weeks ago and have over 2500 miles on it. Too new to have experienced any reliability issues yet, but haven't got any rattles yet! Had a 1998 Cherokee, but this one is better. The Inferno Red always gets positive comments.",3
2167,"This is my third SL since the new style was introduced in 2003. The 2007 model is the best I have driven to date. Everything in the car is updated and refined. If Mercedes quality whent down a bit, it is back to a higher standered with the 2007 edition.",4
2168,"I purchased the C300 sport, 7 speed auto, 18"" AMG rims, multimedia, ipod kit, premium 1 package for a little over $40K OTD. This car is absolutely beautiful and will still look just as good in my driveway 10 years from now. The performance of this car is great and has sufficient power to press you back into your seat! The multimedia package is an absolute must for this car, especially if youre going to spend all this money. The interior looks fantastic and not ugly like the BMW 3 series. Eventhough it's a ""sport"", this car is built more for touring and cruising than racing. But why would you want to drive off fast in this car anyway? Cruise and let people stare at it!",4
2169,"4 cylinder EX with leather, handling package and sunroof. In other words, loaded. Only complaints I have are a bit of a stiff ride and issues with passenger side airbags. I think this car is much underrated by many reviewers and I would like to know why. Great warranty and nice styling.",3
2170,"The Outback handles great in every day driving around town or on the highway. Steering is light and responsive. The Outback's 3.0R engine delivers plenty of refined power with a hint of growl. The transmission delivers that power unobtrusively. I normally leave SI drive in Intelligent mode but when necessary ""sport sharp"" mode (S#) provides that extra punch. The Outback's raised ride height means more suspension travel (take that speed bumps!) and it has a smooth ride over rough surfaces. I think the Outback looks the part of a luxury wagon. The interior is upscale and comparable to my 2004 Passat. The materials feel substantial and fit and finish are excellent. Braking is very sure.",3
2171,Have been driving this car for almost a week - very pleased so far! Some highlights: Performance is more than adequate (no gas thirsty V6 needed). Freeway driving/merging is a breeze. Very comfortable and roomy interior despite its compact exterior dimensions. Perfect for my family of 4. Gas mileage - still on my first tank of gas! And it can only get better from now. Build quality is flawless. Materials used are top notch (and I have the base Sport model). Stereo sounds good. Great handling at low and high speeds. Short turning radius for easy parking! I highly recommed this car! It is the perfect car for small families (2 kids or less). Go buy one!,3
2172,"I moved up from a 96 Chevy S10 to a 2008 Sierra, and like the title says so far so good?! I am impressed with the ride and overall appeal of the truck. I had a spray-on bedliner installed and the truck has no problem getting any big job done.",3
2173,"I have 15k on the car. AIR CONDITIONING IS HORRIBLE. I live in Colorado where we have had 20 days of 90+ heat. And when I drive the car home, the AC STOPS BLOWING COLD AIR whenever the car is stopped (w or w/o autostop). Honda manufacturing & my local dealer have confirmed ""THIS IS THE WAY THE CAR IS DESIGNED. In order to get the AC to blow cold air, the engine must be above a certain RPM."" Do you have any idea how uncomfortable it is to be sitting in the blazing sun at 5200 ft with no AC? It sucks. That's why I bought a car WITH AC. Turns out I must rev at the stoplights to have AC. Really disappointed with Honda. wish I had known this before buying.",0
2174,"But I paid only $15,599 after some haggling. The handling, ride, and comfort all are top notch. I took it to a local snowed-in park and did mange to finally get stuck, but then I learned to stay in L and keep a foot on the brake to prevent wheel spin. The traction control on the Sport is probably worth the extra $1,000. I love the MP3/WMA CD player, intermittent rear wiper, keyless entry, daytime running lights, and LOW insurance. The automatic transmission shifts very smoothly and runs at only 3,000 rmp at 80 mph, which is 1,000 rmp less than the manual. I'm still on my first tank of gas so I don't know the millage yet. The tumble-forward rear seat creates a large, square cargo area, that is great for dogs. But I'll probably remove it.",3
2175,"We looked everywhere for a car that got decent gas mileage and held lots of car seats. This is the only crossover or SUV on the market with the lower anchors in the third row. For that matter there are only 2 mini vans that have lower anchors in the third row. I love the safety features and the car is easy in and out. As far as the gas mileage, on highway trips it's great, on many short little runs to the pool etc. not so great. We got this more for long trips with our little babies and our dog. Also the price, we got the SEL it came nicely equipped in a very affordable range. It allowed our young one income home to have a new car that would fit everone.",3
2176,"I really wasn't planning to buy new, but with more than a $9,000 discount off sticker, how could I pass up a new Miata. Great car! I miss the go-cart feel and exhaust noise of the 93, but the ride is much more comfortable. Definitely leans more in corners. I'll be adding RX8 sway bars soon. Looking forward to many happy years in my new Miata.",4
2177,"All things considered just a nice little car. It's easy on the eyes and on fuel, double what I got in my 1999 F-150.That's not a big surprise, but the handling is. It's much better then most of the imports in its price range and better equipped. I have not driven a car on a regular basis for more than 15 years, it reminds me of my 6 cylinder Mustang (1965) but with pick- up and way better handling. 30 mpg so far in mix of highway and city driving and no trouble keeping up with traffic or passing at 70 mph. Ya-hoo, fun and furgle. Let's see if it's as bullet proof as all my Ford trucks.",3
2178,"I've owned this car for 7 months now. This car pretty much seemed problem free up until when the weather gets really hot. Squeaks and rattles appear to come alive throughout the interior and pinpointing the area is difficult. Both sun visors came apart in the heat and failed to stay up. A/C condensation spills into the passenger interior instead of outside. Interior is very easy to scrape/scratch/scuff. Interior fabric and door panels will start to fade in the Summer sun. As for the driving aspect, clutch squeak, gear shifting hits a wall (all gears) and a/c belt squeak is becoming a common recurrence. Pedestrians will get lost in the large blind spots and the throttle response lags.",1
2179,"Absolutely wonderful car! It has a good deal of power for a 4 cylinder, and despite the mileage ratings I'm averaging 27-28 mpg with mixed city and highway driving. The tC comes loaded from the factory with everything a buyer could want. The upgraded stereo is worth the extra price and sounds awesome (for most users at least). I have no regrets about buying this car.",4
2180,"Just bought this truck to replace my 15 year old Chevy Silverado half-ton pickup. Got the LT1 package with 5.3L V8. First trip had 19 mpg with combined city and highway. In just the city, it seems to only get about 11 mpg. The truck is very quiet and rides well. So far, I'm quite pleased. Pricing was good in Sept with the GM employee discount and additional 5K discount. Also got $1800 off with my GM card savings and I qualified for an additional GM company card bonus of $500. Every little bit helps in this crazy economy!",3
2181,"We are new to the minivan thing so i can only say moving from the 2005 Nissan Altima I am very pleased with the Quest so far. Drivability has been great, it handles very well for a minivan and has plenty of room to boot. Looking at the 06 model versus the 07, I have to say they are moving the design in the right direction on the styling.",3
2182,I looked at a lot of other cars and when I got in this GTI all I could say was WOW. The performance and shifting were perfect. Its feels like I can beat anyone. Not only was it fast but confortable also. Everything seems to be just right in and out of the GTI. The turbo has very little lag and between 2 and 4 this thing can fly. I just got it but so far I have heard and earful of compliments and I have never been happier to drive to work in my life. The price is def. worth what you get. I would recommend this car to anyone tring to find a car under 30k and get your bang for your buck. For sure.,4
2183,"I had one of the best expiriences driving the new Mercedes Benz E63. For some reason I just did not find anything wrong with the car for me to say oh they should have done this like this or anything like that. If you like the E55 then you'll love the E63. Not only does the car have speed that you need but also the handling that we all seek for. Taking turns at like 40 mph the car sticks to the road like it's on railroad tracks. Anyways long story short, if you have the money, this is the car you should get. I am a hundred percent that you will not regret buying this car.",4
2184,"2008 Cr-v is a great car. For the money I paid for it, I got much more than I have expected. People say the engine in the Cr-v is not powerful enough - thats simply not true. I find this car to have more than enough power for whatever my needs might be. Besides, it is fast, quiet, has virtually no blind spots, and handles really nice. Plus, it is hard to find an SUV in this price range that looks so good both inside and outside.",4
2185,"My wife and I considered just about every SUV and crossover on the market. We were both surprised to find ourselves in a Saturn dealer. Rightly or wrongly, we still considered Saturn to be a car company for first-time car owners, and especially not for high-end cars. We were very pleasantly surprised. We've only had the Outlook for a few days but are very happy with it so far.",3
2186,"I was overwhelmed with smoothness and quietness of the vehicle. My family was overjoyed with it. My previous vehicle was 2004 Totoyo Sequoia which was also great, but the Land Cruiser is the better one.",4
2187,"My wife and i bought two SX-4 in december 2006. At first we did like the car but after a couple of month we thought that it was consuming more gas than the seller told us, but we dealt with it by slowing down our speed in order to stay beneath 9 liters/100km. We now have them for a little more than two and a half year and last week at 72K km, my wife's car alternator jammed and it wasn't covered by warranty anymore so we paid to changed the alternator. 10 days later, at 78K km my car's alternator jammed as well! We tought thas was abnormal so we called the dealership and he told us he couldnt do a thing. We then contacted suzuki canada and they told us the same thing. Don't buy that car!",1
2188,"My first week with A5 reveals it's a well-made car. Exterior design appears even much more beautiful in real life than the pictures. Walter de Silva (designer) was right when he says A5 is his best design. Interior design is peerless, controls perfect and intuitive, fit and finish defines fit and finish. Audi design doing in the auto world what Apple computers did in the computer world. Performance of the V-6 is not as robust as the BMW 335i coupe, which was the other car to choose from. However, A5 is powerful enough for everything besides drag- racing.",3
2189,"We traded a Buick minivan (2 yrs old), and couldn't be happier. No mechanical problems at all with this car. We love it. We have 8,000 miles on it. The only drawbacks are that it never gets the advertised hwy mileage (we only get 24-26 MPG tops), and the road noise is evident when on a bumpy highway/road. The features of this car were better than the traded vehicle (at half the price)--antilock AND stability control AND airbags all around. Feels very safe, and I really enjoy driving it. Can't go wrong at this price for a 7 seater! Will buy from KIA again.",3
2190,Our Freestyle is a great family car as it adapts very quickly and easily. My nine year old son has no problem flipping the back seats when extra cargo room is needed but it is also great to have seating for six when needed. Car handles very well and is easy to drive. I wanted to get my wife a nSUV but not a large one. The Freestyle is a perfect choice for us.,4
2191,"Got every available option on my X6, and I am loving it! Don't confuse this car with an SUV; it is a Sports Activity Coupe with room for any foursome (golf, tennis, skiing, or dating)and all the accompanying equipment (clubs, rackets, skis, and luggage). My grandson can even watch movies in the back seat! Just got mine back from BMW Collision after rear ending a Cadillac sedan. Awesome collision safety behavior from the car with only frontal damage while the Cadillac regretfully was demolished. The repair by BMW looks amazing!",3
2192,"Car is so much fun to drive and has tons of cool features! I really like the advanced air bags and how the back seats recline, fold up, and fold down. This car has tons of head room! Gets excellent gas mileage! I love it!",4
2193,"Already have 3200 miles on the odometer. While I haven't gotten the 40+mpg results, I have been averaging 38 mpg driving the speed limit. With my commute of 80 miles round trip five days a week, I'd be saving over $4000 over five years (in today's $4.50 per gallon gas price) compared to the 2007 Accord V6 it replaced that gets 27 mpg in conservative driving.",3
2194,"Coming from an 05 Lexus RX, this is a significant improvement. The MDX feels solid on the road. Handles firm but comfortable on the highway. Havent had a chance to check it out in the snow but looking forward to it. Gas mileage could be better but its got 300 horses, cant have everything. Nav system is a big plus. Easy to use and comes with bluetooth and a very good sound system in the package.",3
2195,"The Pilot has Power on the road. I did a lot of research on several automobiles I was interested in and decided on the Pilot. I love the Pilot and I feel I made the best decision for my family. The Pilot had everything I needed in safety, comfort, and style. It had the best ratings and beat out all the other SUVs in its class. It also had the best value in price. The service at DCH Paramus Honda (NJ) was great, and my salesman was terrific. I will recommend them to family and friends whenever they need a new car. Go for the Honda Pilot, you will make the right decision.",4
2196,"I've owned my Rabbit now for a little over a month. Each and every day I look forward to the commute to work because the Rabbit is so much fun to drive. No problem merging onto the highway, or passing slower traffic. The ride is firm but smooth, and engine response is immediate. I test drove the Scion tC, Mazda-3, Toyota Matrix, Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, and Chevy Cobalt. None of them could touch the Rabbit in terms of overall feel, and build quality. If you're looking for an inexpensive ""fun"" car, don't pass up test driving the Rabbit.",4
2197,"This is my third STI. So far it is my favorite! It is more grown up now, which is perfect for someone that has graduated from the blue interior and giant wing (which I STILL love). The hatch is really great for hauling around stuff or for a guy with a family. The car has lost a little edge from the old one, but for my needs, it's for the better. I do recommend a 3M clear bra as the water based paint is still not as durable as it should be and rock chips WILL happen. The car is a little more incognito because of the new shape and isn't quite as much of a cop magnet.",4
2198,7500 miles with this Sorento - feels comfortable to drive and has good visibility. In town mpg average is 15- 16 and best on the road at 65 MPH is 25. (accurately measured - not guessing). Most annoying though is the transmission. At 10-15 mph it stays locked in 5th gear and the vehicle will actually start to jump a little as this is too slow for this gear. Step on the gas and you aren't going anywhere in a hurry. The trans should shift itself down to match road speed. This is my biggest disappointment with this vehicle and the dealer says that is just the way it is.,3
2199,"My last 9 cars have all been $35+ luxury cars. When my last 2002 Odyssey bit the dust (after 220,000 miles) I decided to buy a car that would pay for itself because of improved gas mileage. After test driving a Civic, I realized I needed something with more interior space and focused on the Corolla instead. I found a great deal on a used 2009 LE, and have enjoyed it ever since. Very spacious inside (important, as I am tall as are my 4 sons) and great gas mileage. I do consistently about 38 miles per gallon on average and as such the car pays for itself (compared to my Honda). I only wish there was a remote trunk release and a horn beep when you remote lock the doors. Overall, rate it A+.",4
2200,"This is my second PT. My first met with an untimely end and other than a few colorful bruises and sore spots I survived. My 2002 Limited didn't. I'm so very impressed with these vehicles I bought another to replace my still missed PT. But it was meant to be. Because the PT I just happened to find tucked away in this private dealership is ONE of the 500 that were made. Yep, I got one. I have a Sunset Boulevard Street Edition PT Cruiser. This car is gorgeous! And it's mine, mine, mine!!",4
2201,"This is just the finest looking SUV on the road today. Very comfortable and it delivers in excess of the 22mpg highway. Mine is fully loaded with everything imaginable. Instrumentation is excellent including the heads up display on the windshield. Bose is great as is the 36 ""favorites"" you can set up on the audio. It's nice that you can move from AM to FM to XM without changing the mode. This is my first SUV so I'm just getting used to the size. My last car was a BMW 330 so the change is quite dramatic for me. Backup camera helps tremendously in reverse.",4
2202,"In the period of time I have had this car it has broken more times than the entire life of my 91 CRX. This car was purchased to be a daily driver as the CRX is modified and I was attempting to keep low miles on it. However, I've found myself having to drive the CRX more because this car breaks quite frequently. So far in the less than 12 month of owning it the fuel pump has been replace 2x, the starter has been replaced 1x and still won't turn over reliably, the tranny has been rebuild 1x, the a/c blower has been replaced 1x, the cd unit has been replaced 1x, and I'm sure I've forgotten a few. I will never buy a Nissan car ever again, and will trade in for a Fit soon.",0
2203,"Nothing really to gripe about. Excellent ride, real tight, no rattles. Plenty power and torque. All the bells and whistles. I like it. The styling is growing on me.",4
2204,"I got my xD for a long commute - I drive 1000 miles a week on average. My gas mileage is consistently 35+ mpg on the highway, 32-34 overall. It's a little noisy, but responsive and smooth. It's cute as anything; people are always turning to check out my car! I've never owned a hip car before. A little more cargo space would be nice. The stereo controls are great, and I love that cruise control comes standard. I wish the fuel gauge was a little more attention-getting. Sometimes I don't notice that I'm low on gas until it's been flashing for a while; it's not very bright. I actually ran out of gas on my first tank... then again, I should pay more attention!",3
2205,"Runs great, has really amazing pickup and go, I really like the improvement in the tranny's more than anything because our `98 Grandcaravan that we traded in, it's tranny was garbage even though it was a 4-speed but the new 6-speed is awesome. Overall, I completely satisfied with this van.",3
2206,"After a few weeks of ownership, I have learned that the A5 continues to impress, and truly is the beautiful girl whom you can marry and live with. The most amazing epiphany is remarkable fuel efficiency that exceeds EPA estimates of 18 and 27. I have averaged 26 in city, 34 on highway! My weekly trip to Costco also revealed I could transport abundant cargo; 3 large boxes of diapers and baby wipes, detergent, gallons of juice, and more.",4
2207,"This vehicle is heads and shoulders better than the Yukon it replaced. Much more sophisticated, beautifully engineered, and a pleasure to drive. I specifically ordered bench seats to increase cargo capacity. It's huge. I've been driving GM vehicles for more than 40 years, and this is by far the best. Vehicle has a solid and steady feel to it. Interior is well laid out although small buttons take getting used to.",4
2208,"I have driven this XL7 over 15000 miles in 6 months,on the highway(gets up to 80 mph like a champ),in town accelerates with the best,reliable performance every day;Great Car!Wife loves it(and she drives a luxury car costing twice as much.) Have had ""0"" problems, except would like to buy driving/fog lights to look cool and can't seem to find any. W.C.Smith",4
2209,"Rented a car in may 2007, was upgraded free to 2008 kia sedona for a week. best test drive ever. Wife fell in love with van. Finally in the market to purchase a vehicle March 2009, Sedona only one came to mind. Love everything about sedona. Engine same size as the 98 z34 monte carlo, V6 3.8l. nice acceleration and handling. My wife and I argue over who gets to drive when we go places now.",4
2210,This is the best car I have ever owned. I get 34.5 mpg. hwy and 27.5 in the city. The only negative I would mention is that it makes a rubbing sound when backing up and the dealer told me that is standard.,4
2211,"First road trip with the car using sport shifting with the dsg and was completely gobsmacked by the performance of this car. Goes like stink, handles the curves like it's nobody's business and that transmisssion is without a doubt the best in the world and worth the extra cash. Throw the back seats down, throw the dog in, and off you go. Lots of room for two with luggage and that's all you need. Gas mileage is superb for a car with this performance. Too bad is has to be high test but you can't get everything. Ipod setup is easy but info on instrument panel could be a little more informational and clearer. But just go drive (faster if possible) you will love this car",4
2212,"I have had the car for just over two weeks and am completely satisfied with my choice. I test drove four competitor vehicles and found the TSX to be the most fun to drive and best value of the bunch. I commute about 100 miles a day mostly highway miles and find the gas mileage acceptable, >30 mpg. Seems 66 mph is the sweet spot for best mpg on the highway. I appreciated most of the extras being standard which makes finding the right vehicle simply a question of which transmission, which color, and with or without navigation. I highly recommend the navigation.",4
2213,"I just took delivery of a fleet Avenger -its got the 2.7 liter V6. This car has plenty of power. Don't believe the car reviews. It's quiet, smooth,looks like nothing else on the road. The style is quirky, but grows on you. I haven't had it long, I have owned two Sebrings before and NEVER had a problem with them. The Avenger surprises me with its extras- outside temp gauge, tire pressure warning, power adj driver seat, 4 wheel disc brakes, and Sirius radio. And the price was unbeatable. Way more room inside than the new Malibu. If I could have, would have picked the SXT If you want to buy American- this car is hard to beat. Why do car mags always give these vehicles a bum rap?",3
2214,"I am leasing the new 2008 Mazda3 with the 2.0 liter engine and so far, it has been great. It is the later 2008.5 model with more standard features. It handles extremely well and corners sharp-great for city driving. Amazing MPG as well.",3
2215,"The first thing I did with this vehicle is install a fresh air intake, a cat back dual exhaust system and a jet chip. This vehicle needs to come stock with at least a 260hp engine in it. I have boosted this engine up to around 235hp but it still drags in sixth gear on an up hill run. Also only offering two rear end ratios is a crime. Mine has the 3.21 in it and that is to high and it still only gets about 19mpg. A mid range of around 3.51 would help. I have already decided to get my next one with the automatic transmission and the trailer towing package. A small diesel would also be nice, something with a good torque rating. All in all this is the best jeep I have ever driven or owned.",4
2216,I really like my Saturn Outlook. I replaced a Toyota 4runner that had multiple problems over the two year lease I had. The Outlook kills the Toyota in every way. Build quality and quietness is way better than the Toyota. I would buy another saturn in a mnute. I will never buy another Toyota,4
2217,"I love this car. I owned an MDX before purchasing the 2008 with the new body style and roomier interior. I opted for the loaded version. I think the joystick navigation is wonderful and so much easier to use. I also love the new body style. The inside is roomier than the older version. With trying to stay in the midsize SUV and having a 3rd row seat, this can't be beat. The 3rd row folds down flat for lots of cargo space when not using the 3rd row. Also, with the position of the handles now being in the middle instead of the top of the seats, it is much easier to pull the seats up when using the 3rd row. One simple tug and ""presto"" - extra seating. Great buy! You'll love it!",4
2218,"Only had it now for 2-weeks, but, love it. Makes me feel like I am driving a 318i or 325i BMW. Smooth ride and great handling with great gas mileage, I am getting the first 2-weeks 28 mpg already and only have 430 miles on the odometer. I got my Astra loaded with the works, heated leather seating with adjustable lumbar fullsize moonroof 4- speed automatic. most everything else was standard on the Astra. My advice to you is go drive it. I traded my 2006 V6 Saturn Vuew in the Astra I downsized in cargo space only but what a great trade off. Works for me. Drive on yourself, buy it and write your own review on here...fuel ecomomy is better than the Potiac Vibe or Toyota Matrix.",3
2219,"This is a well built truck. handling, comfort, and quality are are tops compared to the other trucks i have looked at and driven. I have heard the news about chrysler and nissan getting together to build a new truck in 2010. Im glad i got mine now. Anyway, I love my Titan, its a sexy beast.",4
2220,"Our Q7 has been at the dealer for the past 45 days and they have no estimate as to when they will return it. This car has been a nightmare. Brakes started screeching at 2000 miles and in the 2.5 years that I have owned this car, it has been at the dealer over 20 times (excluding scheduled maintenance). The starter has been replaced twice which requires the entire engine to be pulled from the vehicle (nice design). Audi does have roadside assistance which is nice since I have had to utilize this service 6 times to have the vehicle towed to the dealer. The Q7 S-line is a cool looking SUV, if the cool design does not turn heads, the screeching brakes will!",0
2221,This car is so smooth. I also have a pilot and this car rides and handles much better. Has a real luxury feel to it.,3
2222,"Initial reactions from my friends is usually ""This is a Saturn?"" This car really impresses with its combination of style, build quality, european flavor, standard equipment, handling, and value. It handles like a dream, sharp and secure. The steering wheel is thick and grippy and the feedback is really excellent. The interior quality excells with soft-touch materials and the seats are well-bolstered. The 5-speed shifter is precise but a bit notchy. The clutch is just about right. The engine is peppy and rev-happy but the car is not a rocket. Overall, this is a practical and economical driver's car with european driving characteristics. Give it a try!!",3
2223,I've had this CR-V for 4 months with 3500 miles. I have not had one disappointing moment. I'm getting 20 mpg in city and 27 mpg on Highway . I'm yet to go for the first Oil change / service.,3
2224,"I originally posted here on 12/11/2006, three days after I picked up my MX-5. Well, here I am about 1 year later and I still love this car. I have nothing but great things to say -- still getting 30 mpg and have had no problems with the car. The PRHT is perfect; interior/exterior finish still looks great; no issues requiring any service or repair; extremely fun to drive with plenty of responsiveness; 6-speed automatic works great; still an amazing vehicle. I still suggest that you go get one!! ;-)",4
2225,"Loved this car, I have the ES. Nice cheap car to get you around. Have taken it to Dallas and back a few times which is about 4.5 hours away from me. Loved driving it every mile of the way. Haven't had any problems with it at all yet. The engine doesn't feel that luckluster for a tiny 4 cylinder which is good. Car is amazingly sharp when just putting tint on the windows and giving it a good wash. A real looker. Gas mileage is awesome, I drive the highway to work and back and get around 33mpg when I don't use the a/c. Very very nice car, I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have kids. Backseat is a little small.",4
2226,"Wonderful car overall. I had owned an Acura RL and BMW 5 series prior to purchasing the Hybrid GS450 only about 4 weeks ago. Downsides are small trunk space and less than predicted fuel economy (so far, only one tank and I got 22 MPG...the vehicle rating claims are 24-28 MPG). I find the car to be a great combination of comfort and performance.",3
2227,"This little car is more than what I expected for the cost. I would have to say it moves nicely and does not have any issues getting around for a little 2.0 liter. I am happy to lower my payments as this is a great car for the money, I would choose it over a Honda civic any day of the week. Our other car is a 06? Honda Accord and the Focus is quieter than my fully loaded V6 Accord. The interior is clean and well thought out as the controls with the satellite radio and sync take a little getting used to. I will have to say that ?The Sync is far superior to the i-control of the BMW 5 series and the Honda Accord that I own.? This is a gas saver and a great commuter car and garage others",3
2228,"This thing is a steal. I liked my Rav, but I like this A LOT more. The styling is fantastic and it feels huge inside. Kind of a Maxi Cooper -) Even though the Rav was $6K more, this feels like a trade up! Sound system is excellent and contrary to many opinions, I love the digital speedo. Rides like a big car and has enough headroom for someone 6 foot 3 inches!",3
2229,Looked for a long time at SUV's and decided not to buy because of price. Saw the XL-7 in a parking lot and thought it looked cool. With incentives I got XL-7 for about $9K less tha a similarly equipped Toyota or Honda. I drove it cross country and averaged 24 mpg while traveling 75 mph. I have had no complaints with fit and trim although engine noise was present during break in. Only thing I would change is the power seats need to be eight way vs six.,3
2230,"Purchased this 07 Jetta 2.5L 5cyl 2 yrs ago brand new, has been a very good car, handles great on highway. Have had to replace the gas tank door on warranty. The bad thing is I have to buy the Catrol full synthetic oil at AutoZone along with filter for local mechanic to change the oil. Love the 10k mile oil change intervals. This car has been A++ excellent compared to our old 2003 Passat which was a nightmare (since assembled in Germany, compared to the Passat in Mexico). Car is very sporty & sometimes catches people's eye.",3
2231,"I love my new Nitro! I got the Nitro in the Red, it is very eye-catching and handles really well. Plus it is quiet, much quieter than my 2001 Honda Odyssey. I wanted to get away from the minivan now that my kids are getting older but really didn't want a car or big SUV so this was an excellent compromise! I am looking forward to seeing how it handles in our winter weather. Would recommend this car to anyone. The only complaint I have is that the gas mileage isn't the greatest, but I am hoping this corrects itself as the car gets more ""broken in"". Love the looks, have gotten many comments already, and my stepsons would love to drive it for me",3
2232,"Hello Yaris! I needed a small commuter after 95K miles of long distance traveling on my old job. I have put 1000 miles on my new '07 Yaris and I have no regrets. Getting 35 mpg combined city/hwy, love the velvety smooth 5-speed, electronic steering (so easy for city parking), peppy pick up, great handling. Thought I would hate the center speedo but I love it at night, no glaring speedo in front of you. Yaris gets me lots of looks - never thought a car could be cute, but this is!",4
2233,"This car is pretty good: it handles well, is pretty good on gas and is quite comfortable. It?s one major drawback is what they perceive to be a marketing plus: OnStar. It is unreliable, an annoyance, and definitely not worth the money. With so many other equally acceptable alternatives out there (unfortunately for the domestic manufacturers, most of them are foreign made) it is a shame that we are effectively forced by GM to look elsewhere if we are to be able to get a car we really want. What really stinks is that most of the rental cars are not equipped with OnStar but the general public is not offered this same level of courtesy.",3
2234,"It has great acceleration and hugs the road very well. The suspension is stiff and reminds me of my old RSX-S (could be good or bad depending on the driver). I've driven from TX to CA in this and was not fatigued. All in all, it is a pleasure to drive. I do extensive research whenever I buy pretty much anything and I found this to be a better buy than the competitors.",4
2235,"There are 2 outstanding features about this car: 1) The engine: It pulls throughout its entire range. 2) Room: So much back-seat room. More room than the previous generation Lexus LS. I have owned many cars, sports and lurury. The Avalon offers a superb ride. There is a little too much lean in corners, and it tends to oversteer when pushed. The flip side of this is a nice ride for commutes.",3
2236,"Took my family of five on long trip, two of my boys are 6-2 180 pounds and with no complaints about room. Love the power, this truck pulls better than my v8 Chevy",3
2237,"I can not say much bad about this minivan it rides very well, great on hihway mileage. It gets over 500 MPG on the highway and it has alot of great features and things to kee children busy.",4
2238,Very happy so far. I have the C300 Sport and I really like the exterior styling. The car is very comfortable and rides and handles very well. Pleasantly surprised to be getting about 25 MPG with the 7 speed automatic. Overall I feel it is a very good value for the money.,3
2239,This Explorer rocks! The most stable and quite vehicle that I have ever owned. I have the 4.6L V8 which has been at 19 mpg city/hwy combined. The only thing that I don't like is the 6 spd tranny. It makes the V8 lag. Should of put the 5 spd that comes with V6. Good quality interior parts. Smooth looking exterior for a truck. Explorer has 13K miles with no problems so far.,3
2240,"I traded a Tacoma 4x4 @17+ mpg for this hybrid. I no longer need a truck and I couldn't be happier with the Camry Hybrid. It' been cold here, but I'm still averaging 36.5 mpg. I couldn't be happier.",4
2241,"I have this car 6 month 8500 miles and still love it. I have owned 15 new cars in my life and this holds 2nd place as my favorite. 1990 Chevy Lumina Euro holds first place. Great car fun,fun,fun for a 4 door family car. Being a 38 year old guy with 2 kids and a wife it fits the bill. Wife drives a crossover. Glad to buy the 2008 and save big$$$. No problems, no complaints. Good room in front looks great. I have to recommend putting on a spoiler it changes the whole look of the car. The Zoom Zoom makes it happen, go Mazda",4
2242,"This is a great vehicle for the price. Even not factoring in the price, it is a great vehicle. I compared the QX to the Lexus LX 570. The LX has great bells and whistles, but the trade offs for going into the QX with the great price savings make the choice a no brainer.",4
2243,"This care is terrific. My girlfriend bought one and I was/am a staunch VW supporter who drives a 1.8T. I have to say this Honda is first class and for the features it comes with you couldn't touch a VW for less than 30,000 with the same features. It looks really sharp and sounds incredible when you get into the VTEC range.",4
2244,"First time owner of a Mercedes. Engine and transmission very smooth. Nice handling. Lots of standard features, including safety features. Very fast in breaking. Took car to almost 130 - yeah, crazy me!! Car felt very smooth - can't feel the speed. I cruise on freeway and realize I have to ease on the pedal - I'm doing 90. Only 1 complaint - you feel the bumps too hard. Needs improvement on suspension. Yes, it has a sports suspension which has been lowered over the luxury model, but you sure feel those bumps. I've taken few pounds off pressure of the tires to releave this problem - much beter, however, my ""check pressure"" keeps coming up.",3
2245,"I got my car at the end of March and waiting to until now to review it. I'm very happy with it. I did have a '92 Civic before and couldn't get rid of it soon enough. This car is not what you expect from an economy car. I drove from Philadelphia to Wilmington, NC for a wedding and then back up the coastline for a vacation. On the highway, I averaged 42 mpg with the air conditioning on. I didn't have any concerning the seats. The Civic has nice pickup and this is the only time I really hear the engine when the revs go over 2500.",4
2246,"I bought mine on New Years Eve. Looked all over for the Red Jewel one. Went to a dealer the day before and they sold the one I wanted an hour before I got there. Managed to locate one the next day and bought it. I love it. I've always been a Honda buyer so this is my first American car for a while. This is definitely my red jewel. It's gorgeous, and fun to drive and so very smooth. Plus the family love all the options we got with the DVD play XM radio etc.",4
2247,"You may as well buy this one!!! Don't let some of the magazine reviews turn you away from buying this gorgeous vehicle. I mean, let's face it, is there a halfway decent car out there that has room for the whole family AND gets good gas mileage. The simple answer is NO. My 2008 Sequoia is a smooth smooth ride, and mine spends its time on Boston roads, which are some of the worst pothole infested roads in the country. Some reviews say that the steering is too easy, and coming from a 4runner I can see what they are saying, but if the Sequoia had a Lexus badge they would be complementing its effortless steering instead of trying do equate it to a Chevy Silverado.",4
2248,"I am 22 and have had two Jaguars and loved them. I wanted something different and tried the Mercedes. I was very reluctant because I have read so many horror stories about Mercedes reliability but the more refined 07 has been perfect. It is quite, safe, luxurious, sporty, wow list goes on and on it is truly an amazing car.",3
2249,"I have just bought this car and have less than 200 miles so far on it and already this car has impressed me in so many ways. The Civic has such a sporty feel and yet its a very practical, quiet and comfortable ride. The reliabilty for Honda has always been high in standards and this one is certainly a keeper. The drive and the style is unsurpassable it doesnt do any justice just reviweing the car, it has to be driven to beleive what I mean by exactly. As soon as I test drove this car I knew in my mind that there was no reason to look at any other cars. The features that have been included are really cool and the accesories that can be added on just makes this vehicle flawless.",4
2250,"Great value, very fun to drive, driving is easy on the sole, comfortable, clean lines, sporty, excellent after-market toys, can be personalized, outstanding quality and next car, only a lexus could be better!",4
2251,"There is no joy driving my TL because upon acceleration at 2000 RPMs, it feels very rough like a grinding under the floor. After 2000 RPMs the rough feeling under the floor clears up. I have owned a lot of cars and our two other older vehicles (one of them is a truck and the other a small car) outperform this one. Other annoyances: when It rains and you open the trunk, water jumps the gasket and pours into the trunk space - debris too. There is excess noise when the moonroof is closed and the ceiling partition open when I'm on the freeway. I would like my 2005 TSX back. This is our fourth Acura and probably our last. I should not have to write a review like this.",1
2252,"Overall, very satisfied, but have a few warnings. MPG is hopelessly below what the EPA sticker says (barely get 20mpg in city). Although the trunk is voluminous, the opening is smaller than the Century and I find it difficult to get large objects inside. And whoever put that piece of chrome across the middle of the dash so all sunlight from 10am to 2pm shines directly in the driver's eyes needs to be flogged.",3
2253,"Smooth ride, very good handling with more than adequate acceleration (not as fast as others); great value by any metric but especially features per dollar.",3
2254,"After considering the Highlander, MDX, Pilot, and Enclave, my wife and I settled on the CX-9. While not quite perfect for our needs, it was clearly the best overall SUV, and came out on top for functionality, ergonomics, and as a bonus, it didn't look like the box that a more attractive vehicle came in. We had only looked at the Mazda as an afterthought, figuring we'd end up with the Highlander, but were very surprised at the overall quality and attention to detail in the CX-9. While the Highlander had arguably better performance and interior storage space, it lacked many things the CX-9 offered, such as a split-row third seat and ample room in all three rows, among others. A very good buy.",3
2255,"I say I have to agree with most of the reviews. Its still hard for me to believe how much room is inside. Also the foolproof service display tells you when to change your oil, rotate tires and much more. Love this SUV and its looks great. Fun to drive!!! Great job on the new design!",4
2256,"I am continually surprised at how much attention this car gets! At gas stations, the grocery store, garages, old and young, people come up to me and talk about this car. Everyone loves the look. I knew I loved it when I bought it, I really did not think it would generate this much buzz with people I didn't know. I drive it for mileage on my commute, put the cruise on at 72 and get 30-33 mpg on the highway. Then the weekends, I drive for fun, punch it whenever I can get away with it. I'm putting the cold air intake in soon, I've spoken with other owners who are getting +3 to +4 mpg with it plus the 10 horsepower punch. Best purchase I've ever made!",4
2257,I just feel that I have a truck with great resale value and amazing quality. This is my 4th now Toyota purchase and I am a former big three owner. I love the sonar the big mirrors and the tough looks of the truck itself. It has amazing power speed and throaty rumble when going do the road. Finally it is a work horse and tows my tandem 30 foot trailer with effortless performance,4
2258,"2008 Toyota Avalon Limited. Great car, good looking, very nice ride. However with the traction control there is no way to disengage. In snow/Ice sometimes you need to spin your wheels. Once the traction control engages it shuts down the power and wheel spin. great for some things, terrible in the snow when you need wheel spin. Other than that, no complaints.",3
2259,"Turned in my '03 G35 for new Journey last week. Completely different car. This car feels bigger and heavier. It's quicker off the line but does not feel quite as sporty. Maybe because my last car had the sport package. I enjoyed the exhaust note on the '03 better. Got my '07 with all the options for under 37k. Test drove the Acura TL Type S, not bad but nowhere near the luxury or refinement of the G. The 330i was just too expensive with all the options. So far I'm really enjoying this car. If I could just learn how to use all the toys!!",3
2260,"I looked at a number of cars for several years. In the course of searching I narrowed my criteria to maximum value for few dollars. That eliminated Porsches, BMW's, MB's and a number of other cars. I chose the MX-5 because it was not a compromise. It drives exceptionally, the new interior is first rate, the exterior restyle is spot on and I didn't have to sell a kidney to get it. What really sold me though is that this is what a sports car is. It reminds me of what made cars so important in my life and what made me want a car that was ""special"". The MX-5 is special. I can race this car if I choose, modify it to make it better or leave bone stock and it's just great. It's just perfect.",4
2261,"I tried to talk myself into the LS 460 or the ES350. It came down to the ES, and I decided to save 10000 and still got a superior vehicle: more bells and whistles, better ride, more room (even larger in back seat than the 460) better gas mileage (average for us is almost 29) more power, regular gas. The car is so smooth, the only thing I downgraded was ""fun to drive"". I have a back problem and traded a cadillac to get something really comfortable. This is it. My last three cars have been Cadillac SRX, Infiniti Q45, and Lexus LS 400. The Limited Avalon is superior to the Caddy, and equivalent of the 400 and 430 and Q45. I cannot believe I got this much car for this price.",3
2262,"I bought my car brand new a year ago -- have loved it despite quirks with the windows (no fix for it yet...supposedly coming in late 2008). Drove it responsibly for 14,000 miles in the year to include a trip across country. Now the clutch is ""burnt"" and its not covered under the warranty. They are blaming me, which is ridiculous. I would be wary of buying one again.",1
2263,"Traded in a 2000 Cherokee Sport for an '08 Patriot, was unsure if I wanted to but after test driving it a few times I had to have one. The MPG is great usually runs me about $28-$33 to fill up (lot better then my gas chugging Cherokee which averaged about $50+ a fill up. The Patriot is comfortable, fun to drive, very roomy, feels like a cross between the Cherokee and the Commander. The CVT You have to wait about 1,500 miles for the electronic transmission to dial in to get the correct gear ratios but once it does the performance picks up. I've had mine for about 2 months now and have racked up about 3,500 miles already.",4
2264,"I love this little SUV! I was a little worried about getting an SUV. I drove a 99 Honda Prelude for over 9 years. It was so small and low to the ground, but I have had no problems adjusting to the CR-V! I love Hondas and I fell in love with the CR-V the moment I saw it. When my husband and I test drove it, that was it! It is so much fun to drive and it handles great! I wish the gas mileage was a little better, but hopefully it will improve, as I only have 175 miles on it! It is nice to use regular gas. My Prelude required premium! It's also nice having so much room! I can actually take people in my backseat!",4
2265,"After having several new Toyotas of all sizes, the Yaris 2D Hatch is the most fun to drive. I road tested the competitors and none handled as well, or were rated as high in mileage. This car rides very comfortably and the small turning circle makes it a real pleasure to manuver around in town. I've had mine 6 weeks and average 36 mpg in city only driving. A 300 mile trip on the freeway returned 42 mpg @ 70mph. The interior is very well thought out with lots of cup holders, 3 gloveboxes, & many small storage areas. Mine has the sport seats which have high grade material and are very supportive & comfortable. I could not be happier with my new 2008 Yaris.",4
2266,"I was t-boned on driver's side/other guy going about 50! Walked away from my 2007 Avalanche. Side bags saved my life, as did the vehicle. Avalanche was totaled, as was F250 diesel that hit me. Cops said Avalanche saved my life without question. Bought a new 2008 LTZ. Can't say enough about how great both have been. Not a problem on either one. Had a 2004 Deville and these trucks ride and perform as well as the Caddy. If class, quality, ride, safety, and good looks are important then this is your vehicle. I can't stress how great I feel with all the safety features built into this truck.",4
2267,"This is an excellent, do-everything car. It's roomy, quiet, fun to drive (manual transmission), gets decent gas mileage (27 overall, up to 32 on the highway), has 4 wheel drive, has comfortable seats, and is just a pleasure to own. The fit and finish are very good. The dash top is a textured hard plastic, but it works perfectly and will never peel or crack due to sun damage over the years. And yes, this quite possibly is a car that you will own for a long, long time. The handling is sure footed, the suspension soaks up the bumps for the most part. The seating position is comfortable and the dash layout is intuitive. There are no silly gimmicks, it just works!",4
2268,"I have had this car for two weeks and I have put $130.00 in it driving just in town which is an average of 24 Miles per day. It evaporates the gas, took it in to Suzuki and they found nothing wrong. Saw another Lady at church and she asked me if my car drank allot of gas.I said yes,it does she said hers does as well. Same model and year 08 XL7. Needs to be built fuel economic. Uses to much gas.",1
2269,"Sometimes we take long day trips and I wanted something that we could sleep in and I found the Uplander. We've taken the seats out, put in a full size air mattress,velcroed shades to the windows and have slept comfortably and inexpensively at RV parks. We had an 30' RV, needed lots of gas, space and I didn't like driving around with a toilet and every rattling. We are average size people, 5'4"" & 5'9"", enjoy traveling, dining out and have created our own little over-night pod. We can even take our dogs with us. When we return home, we put the mattress and supplies in a container in the back, keep the 3rd row seats in. If we need more passenger room we can always put the second row back in.",3
2270,"I loved it the day I got it and still do today. The SLK is a slick car that handles excellent and is so much fun to drive. It is small inside and there isn't much room for anything but the bare essentials, but the trunk space is marginally larger than in the past. Lots of fun, everyone checks it out and if you're in a hurry you can put your foot into it and the car will fly. The traction control is very responsive and impressive, but the front end does not stick to the road when cornering at very high speeds.",3
2271,This car is very nice the day after I bought the car I drove it from New Jersey to Florida and it drove great the whole way good power also not a whole lot but its got a lot of pep and will spin tires extremely easy had some problems with the molding under the windshield wipers but the dealer is taking care of that its got a semi sporty interior but a lot of plastic,3
2272,"Approaching 2 months and 2000 miles of commuting in Washington, DC -- avg 23.5 MPG (not bad for second worst traffic in the nation). CVT should be traded for Avenger's 4 spd auto even at expense of mileage. Love the overall driving position and utility. Wish there was less flash/rough edges where hands spend most time -- steering wheel and gear shift handle. Wide a-pillar width is distracting when rounding curves. Adequate rear seat leg room, but wouldn't want to sit on those seats for any length of time. Overall a competent beater, but it's quirks probably give it the lifespan, and legacy, of an AMC Pacer.",3
2273,"Bought the car on Dec 31, 2007. 2008 Mazda 5 GT. Power is adequate. Acceleration is ok, handling is superb, great gas mileage. About 23-25 mpg in LA traffic, but I did log 31 mpg going to San Francisco with 3 adults and 2 kids. Took me a long time to decide between the new CRV to the 5, but I sincerely believe that I made the right choice.",3
2274,"I traded in my low-mileage, garage-kept 2003 Buick LeSabre Limited for the Camry Hybrid due to the fact that I drive in a mostly urban environment and out of fears of soaring gas prices. The trunk is much smaller than the Buick's, but I still have my minivan for the big stuff. My only complaint about the vehicle is the poor quality of interior materials which deliver their own 'symphony' of sounds until the cabin warms up. I expected better in a Toyota. Overall - I am happy with my purchase and would do it again.",3
2275,"It's quick with great pickup and is fun to drive. I like a lot of space in the drivers side area and it has it. The view behind you is very limited because of the high trunk, I still have not mastered backing in to a spot yet.",3
2276,"Love the car, needs a coin holder and better placed hook for hangers in rear. Car fogs up too easy also. Would buy another one.",3
2277,"I have driven the CRV about 1000 miles now, and I love it. Its ride is much smoother than my previous CRV, and it is so luxurious! If you're looking for a smaller SUV, I highly recommend taking this one!",4
2278,"Just had the vehicle over a week, and now I enjoy driving to work, its a wonderful commute car, comfortable, quiet, smooth ride, excellent brakes, enough power to go effortlessly in and out of traffic, the vehicle is responsive and feels tight (well built), it takes road bumps and potholes such that the driver is always in control of the steering, so far I've gotten just under 30mpg using premium gas, about 24 using mid range gas. Was ready to buy RAV4 but after taking test drive and seeing the quality and all the standard equipment there was no question honda is a better deal. Not sure how much better V6 would be, this engine has plenty of power for the average driver...",3
2279,I pull a 26foot trailer and when it comes to a hill you think your in a 4 cylinder. GMC should not sell this as a tow unit.,1
2280,"I bought a Toyota SCION TC for my daughter, I did not buy an extended warranty because of the 60,000 mile 5year warranty that came with the vehicle.The car started to give her problems with a leak into the passenger compartment.With 2 visits they finally stopped the leak. Next came the blower motor that failed.By this time my car had gone by the 60,000 miles that was covered under the warranty.At 73,000 miles my engine failed.I called Toyota who offered to reimburse me for $500.00. A new engine is over $4000.00. In conclusion, I feel there could have been a compromise to this situation. Thanks for listening.",2
2281,"After this past winter my wife wanted all wheel drive but wanted a car not SUV or truck, factor in affordability and Subaru stands alone. This is our first Subaru and so far have been happy. We prefer the more grown up look of the 08 compared to the previous juvenile looking Imprezas. The interior is pretty roomy and comfortable and the exterior is generally pleasant even though it is mistaken for Toyota Corolla by people at first. The car has a nice ride and handles well, the back seat is roomy for a compact and the trunk isn't bad once you factor in the back seat folds down. The cloth seats have a nice look. Gas mileage has been in the 20's with 7500 miles driven.",3
2282,"After driving may competing alternative vehicles, the Enclave out classed them all. Although it took 4 months to get, it was worth the wait. Every aspect of the Enclave is very satisfying. It is obvious from many ""minor"" details that much engineering went into the development of the car. As the owner of 4 Buicks prior to this one, it is the best I've driven in 20 years. The car seems bigger once inside that it appears from the outside, yet it drives nimbly. Anyone that wants a vehicle to carry more than 4 people comfortably needs to drive the Enclave before purchasing any other vehicle. Great Job Buick!",4
2283,"Went to the dealership with intentions of buying another SUV. Drove the SLK280 and fell in love instantly. We like everything about it. 0 to 60 very quickly. Handles very well. Car travels very well and is quite comfortable. Gets over 28 MPG. The warm air scarf on a cool evening ride is great.Be sure to use the wind skirt with the top down and your hair will look like you just combed it, even after a long ride. Good sound system for tunes. Top goes up/down easy and fast. Because the car is so much fun to drive we wanted to take it on our trips to the beach but there is not very much cargo space, so we have decided to UPS our luggage.",4
2284,"I've had problems with the electrical systems (door locks, wipers, Navigation system,) and now worst of all the brakes. I went metal to metal on the rears after 33,000 miles. the calipers are failing to retract properly - thus Pads wearing out totally prematurely. Normally a car goes thru 3 sets of front pads to 1 set of rears. I've had my car serviced by dealerships only, thus far. When they rotate the tires, I ask them to check the brakes since the wheels are already off. Well At the time of last visit to the dealership, (22,363 miles) All was well-- now 11,000 miles later My right rear roter is shot on the inside only due to a defective caliper. What can I do about it????",1
2285,"I'm glad I waited for the new CRV. Was about to get a new RAV4 but did not like the large spare tire on the back. The new CRV looks great and you can't beat the build quality of Honda. One dealership had a $2500 mark-up above MSRP. My dealership never does that and I got a good deal considereing i was getting one from their 1st shipment. The transmission is really smooth - car is extremely quiet. One-touch sun roof can't be heard. Room is fine. Thought I might ge the LX, but the price differnec between the LX and EX isn't all that much. Great looking - gets unanimous praise for looks - really happy with this car.",4
2286,Had a Regal before this. I like this car a lot better although the Regal got a little better gas mileage. Other than this no complaints,3
2287,"Beautiful car to look at and fun to drive. The 6 speed trans is nice but shifts up and down trying to find the right gear often. Car does wonderful on the highway with lots of power to pass and take on the hills. Car has lots of room in cabin and trunk. Gas milage is not as good as advertised. Visibility is difficult at times, see below. Cup holders seem small, like they're for kids cups.",3
2288,"We have had this car one month and love it. We looked at the Accords and Camry, but this car afford all the quailty and reliability with the benefit of added interior room. The 3.8 engine provides tremendous torque and we can get 31 mpg highway. It is very quiet and comfortable on the road.",3
2289,We order a new '07 X5 but after having borrowed the demo from the dealer we found the X5 still to small for a family. Still has the BMW performance though. So we purchased the GL450 and found that it has the size for the family and pretty decent performance. The interior features are great and the safety features are even better. Mercedes did a nice job with this vehicle and I think they hit a high luxury SUV market that BMW has yet to hit. If you need room for kids and cargo look no further! I just hope the build quality coming out of Alabama is better than I've read in the past.,4
2290,"This is my second Altima. I had an 1998 and it was a great car. I love my new 2008 Altima. Beautiful styling and handles great. Very good gas mileage and comfortable since I commute 120 miles round-trip. Highly recommend. I finally got the color of car that I wanted (Sonoma Sunset - Ruby Red), heated leather seats, and sunroof!",4
2291,"After driving my 2007 Camry for 38,000 miles, it was time to get something a bit more comfortable. After having 3 Park Avenues (one of which I put 303,000 on), which are VERY comfortable cars, I was very unhappy with the Camry in the comfort area. I LOVE my Avalon Touring Sedan - so far. Comfortable, quiet, looks nice inside and out. Heck, I'm thinking of up-grading to a Limited with all of the bells and whistles. :) It's very early and my MPG isn't all that great (21-23 +/-), but I'll gladly give up a bit of MPG for the rest of the package. Yes I WOULD tell anyone to purchase one.",4
2292,"I researched many new cars before deciding on the HHR. My wife and I test drove five cars (Dodge Avenger, Dodge Charger, Subaru Legacy, and a Chevy Malibu) and looked at four or five others. Although we almost bought the Malibu we both agreed the HHR would be more practical for us (we have three kids and the Malibu had a small trunk). I've only been driving it for a week, but so far I couldn't be happier. We bought the 2LT with every option. The standard equipment looked a bit unfinished. The leather interior really made the difference for me. It's strange but this is the first time I have liked a car more after I bought it than before. I don't know what else to say. It just fits.",4
2293,"I previously owned a 2005 CTS and loved it. Lease was up so I purchased a used 2.8 with low mileage. Exterior and interior appearance is great as well as the comfort ride, however I just hate the 2.8L engine. I will be planning to get another CTS 3.6 as soon as I can.",4
2294,A lot of fun to drive. Great handling. Excellent braking. Beautiful interior - very comfortable. This is my 7th Volvo and I'm not disappointed. Very classy exterior styling. With freeway driving I'm getting between 27 and 30.5 mpg.,4
2295,This is an amazing car. Fast and comfortable. Great gas mileage. perfect for people who are on the go.,4
2296,16K miles in and it's my 4th trip to the dealership to the address the Fuel Economy issue. A hybrid that can't get more than 18 MPG in the city???!!! It's a Joke! Here is why... GM Hybrid technology is faulty. Ford got theirs from Toyota and the Escape gets 30 MPG (my neighbor has one) that's not a Joke. Maybe it's because it's a Mild Hybrid and GM never got to the full hybrid or plug in as expected.,1
2297,This is my third Civic with other cars between. The car handles better then my Passat and my Mustang. The steering is very light and precise. I noticed a good 34 mpg with a mixed hwy/ city driving. And the best part is no more high grade fuel as with my VW.,3
2298,The Avalon is a great car to experience driving comfort. The interior is very roomy pleasant to use. Keyless ignition is OK but seems to be an answer to a question no one has asked. Exterior is pleasant but could use more classic car styling such as Chrysler has found such success with. All-in-all a great car!,3
2299,"This car is all you would expect from Mercedes Benz. Economy is much better than advertised...25 on the highway at 80 MPH. Comfort is awesome, handling is great and interior layout was well thought out.",4
2300,"My 2008 Civic lx with 3500 miles is getting 25 mpg. My 2004 Odyssey gets 20 and 22 mpg. I do not like the 5 spd auto. It gets on my nerves shifting up and down. It replaced a 1994 escort that never got less than 29 mpg the entire time we had it. And the shifter doesn't stop till d3. I do love everything else about this car but I will never buy another Honda. We will trade this car as soon as we can afford to unless the mpg goes up to 30. Oh yeah, the paint will fade from the acid rain and for an extra $500 they will cover it for 5 years. I have been very happy with my salesman and service rep since 2004. But if I want new untested improvements that may or may not work I will get a Honda!",2
2301,"This has been an absolutely great vehicle. It has restored our faith in American automakers! We live in a rural area with lots of snow and this is great. Good tight handling, smooth transmission and lots of storage. Gas mileage is around 26-28 mpg. Very comfortable seats with an excellent sound system. We've had no problems so far after 18,000 plus miles in all kinds of weather. This vehicle gives me peace of mind for my family with all of the safety features. Why buy a Honda or Toyota when you can get a Jeep Compass!",4
2302,I have a 2007 Jeep Compass and have no regrets buying it. I have the 4x4 Sports and have hand no problems what so ever. This particular make is just now really starting to catch on and I can't understand why Chrysler did not promote it as much. I get a lot of second looks while driving:-) Always wanted a jeep and this one is perfect for me.,4
2303,"LTZ Z71 Crew Cab is the way to go! So far, I am averaging 17.9mpg with 12k miles of driving in all conditions. I love pretty much everything about this truck and I haven't had to take it in for any warranty work yet! the only thing I can say need improvemnts are the roof height if you get a sunroof. I am 6'2"" and sometimes I my head brushes the roof. Annoying as heck. Also, the rear bumper is worthless in the new trucks. I was bumped in the rear left corner. With the old truck, I wouldn't have had any damage at all. However, the bumper on the new truck folded right in and the side panel crushed. $1500 to repair! The lady hardly touched me!",3
2304,"I've driven cross country twice, it's my daily driver, trail rig, and family mover. My Jeep has done everything I've asked of it without a single maintenance issue to date. I've ridden trails from IL, OK, TX, NM, AZ, CO & UT, and the QDII system is hands down the best 4WD system available on the market. Front, rear, center ELSD's provide a sure-footedness I never experienced in my other 4X4's. The luxury is top shelf. Every gizmo I could want, MyGig, HID's, 4 seat warmers, nav system. All work together to provide an incredible driving experience. And it always looks sharp, aggressive, and ready to go.",4
2305,"Convertible sports car owners eat your heart out! The open air driving experience doesn't get any better than this...and you don't have to worry about getting a ticket racing anyone. It sure is nice not to worry about the road conditions limiting you when the outdoors call. I used to have to get friends with high clearance vehicles and 4x4's to take me to the hiking and biking trail heads. Not anymore, I am like a dog in the back of a pickup truck now days, smiling the whole time, and I go when I want. I have a Sahara with all of the bells and whistles because I liked the fenders the same as the body color. It is a great way to travel in a very capable vehicle in style.",4
2306,"I purchased an 07 Civic Hybrid. Not only is it gutless, but fails to get the advertised mpg. I get about 32 around town. Now that's double from my last car and I actually don't mind filling it up. Ups & Downs.",2
2307,"Overall should be very worth while, the body reminds me of the older Lotus Esprit with the long racked windshield. While having to use premium I still already see the cost savings of using this car. Mileage is always in the upper 20's - lower 30's, and this is the sports model in there line, with gas approaching $4 a gallon the couple of cents for premium out ways the difference. It handles very well, corners great, even now I am still amazed at how spunky this car is, it's not the big ""Hemi-V8"" but let the rpms work for you and you can fly. I see people complain there is no power, my response is you don't know how to handle the car then, and you shouldn't drive one then...",3
2308,"Based on several reviews I bought Odyssey without much thoughts. It is a good van for family. But, now I have 900 miles in the car with an awful 10-11 miles/gallon city + fwy. I saw some others also complains about low mileage of odyssey. while my friends 2008 odyssey gives 21 mpg city + fwy in my driving. I took it to the dealer and they asked to leave the car for 3 days for fuel test with out any compensation for replacement car. In general the odyssey makes lot of noise.",1
2309,"I have owned my vehicle for about a year and a half. I have had it into the shop 6 times. I have had 2 recalls and several other issues. I have had the vehicle recalled for stalling (after I had already experienced the stall, which could have caused a serious accident), as well as I had a cracked roof rail, panels came loose over the seat belt on passenger side, air conditioner quit working today at 26,000 miles, the rear inside light will only come on if you hit it (Dodge says its a manufacturing problem) loose carpet, loose console covering, seat had to be removed to fix the carpet, and, the stain resistant seats do not resist anything.",1
2310,I am so pleased with my new Sky. I got it as the result of the person that ordered it was not able to do the finance when the car arrived at the dealership and I happened to be at the right place at the right time. Everywhere I go I get a thumbs up or questions about the car with everyone saying it is really hot. At my age I love the attention and consider it my poor man's Corvette. My license plate reads - I SKY,4
2311,"I drive the S, so it has a sportier look, but nothing sportier under the hood. I don't like that this model is larger than previous generations. At times my compact parks like a small bus. OK gas mileage, though I admit my mileage is 90% city (averaging around 27-30 mpg, 34-37 when I do drive highway).",2
2312,"This car looks great from a distance but open the trunk and wham, primer everywhere, that paint should be like on the outside! Guess that's why the rust protection is what 4 years! Then they put those cheesy plastic plugs through the carpet on the trunk lid to affix it to the metal and put holes in the metal to do it - cheap. I open the hood and there is a long line of open unfinished jagged steel down the inside of each side of the hood. Talk about cheap! Everywhere I look I see corners like that cut.",1
2313,"It makes loud brake noises, especially at low speeds. In addition, I hear the chip noises go on and off every time I accelerate the car. I don't think my next car is a Honda again.",1
2314,"I had a check engine the 2nd. week of purchase; and they haven't quit. I am now waiting for a new and improved turbo, jacob brake,what ever you call it, burned up the first one. Old turbo had been cleaned and reassembled, reset light, and regenerated, to only come back on again! I wish that I had my 05 5.9 back! I was told to drive with turbo on always until the new one comes in. I am pissed off about all of the trips to dealer. I was suckered into buying the ""free"" 3000 mile oil changes. Not anymore! They can shove their oil changes! Some mech. wallowed my cooling fins flat and to top it off I was 2(two)quarts over the full line! I am investigating the Lemon laws in Oregon.",0
2315,"After owning a Ford Focus and a Pontiac Vibe, this is by the best hatchback I have owned. I fell instantly in love with the unique design the moment I saw at an auto show. Anyone who loves attention will love this car, I couldn't count how many times people stop me to ask me about my car plus the looks, stares, and pointing. I've only had one issue so far. The shifter would bind up, but it was covered by warranty and its been smooth ever since. Acceleration is great, handling is superb, interior is simple and comfortable, MPG is nothing too spectacular but still good. Also, it handles decently in the snow, but in SE PA we never really get that much snow anyway.",3
2316,"Just purchased Unlimited X, could not be more happy! Don't believe all the cons you hear/read about. No its not like driving a sports car and it shouldn't be. Pick up is more than adequate(unless you need to drive on the autobahn) I have never driven a more ""fun"" vehicle. Go with the freedom top not the soft. It's a 4 door, 4 wheel drive go anywhere convertible. I cant say enough. I drove a GMC Envoy for the past 6 years, don't have the bells and whistles I had with the Envoy but I don't need them. MPG at this point has been close to 17 both in town and highway. Straight out high way I got almost 21, its only a day old! Don't believe all the negatives you read, test drive one for yourself",4
2317,"At 53 sold my impractical touring motorcycle so I needed some sport w/practicality. Drove VW Rabbit, but 2.3 Mazda 3 was smoother and have owned both in the past, Mazda more reliable. Most important is Electronic Stability Control, have not been able to get it to skid, it is like glued to the road like a Porsche 911 but more balanced. Precise steering. Acceleration is good, better than I expected and it is fun to pass 3 cars at a time on two lane highway. Needed manual and sun roof to keep sport feeling but is clumsy with cell phone in traffic. Very quiet at hwy speeds, 3,050 rpm at 70 in 5th, redlines at 6,500 rpm (top 149 mph??). S Touring has lots of features, cruise, etc. Doors solid.",3
2318,"Looking for a fun vehicle that is very good on gas economy and has a lot of bells and whistles for the money? The Torrent has a responsive feel and very good handling for a crossover type car. Although the horsepower could be slightly higher to create better response, there is plenty of pickup to nudge your way into highway merges. Extensive leg room and flat floor space makes for better comfort than our previous Envoy in the back seat area. Fully equipped with everything but the navigator, my wife seems to marvel at the remote start and sunroof features which add more enjoyment. Better feel than the Equinox, easy to drive, the Torrent makes for a great alternative to pricier crossovers.",3
2319,"I am pleasantly suprised and bought the 2008 2LT model with reservations. However, I am delighted with this car and feel like I definitely got my money's worth from a Chevy. I have not had a GM for years because of the competition and decided to jump in after a test drive. I highly recommend this car for the money.",4
2320,"When I saw the commercial on TV comparing a Ford to Camry and Accord, I just laughed. I knew there was no way an American manufacturer could compete on that level. Boy was I wrong. Much to my surprise, my company selected the Fusion for this years fleet vehicle. This is a quantum leap ahead of the Taurus they issued us i years past. The car feels extremely solid. I corners and accelerates well, and is just plain fun to drive. The hidden gem is the Sync voice activation system. The voice recognition is nearly flawless. I spend a lot of time in the car. Being able to have complete control of my iPod and cell phone without taking my hands off the wheel is a huge advantage.",4
2321,"Let's face it: if you're thinking of buying a Sky, it's because you're in love with the body. It's the Supermodel of Roadsters: you know it's superficial, but you still want to date it. There's really no beating the Sky in terms of a sexy, affordable convertible. Yes, the Miata performs better. You don't care. Yes, the ergonomics are bad. You still don't care. It's sexy, it's affordable... GO BUY ONE. You won't regret it.",3
2322,"We purchased our Hyundai Elantra around the middle of June. We already have over 5000 miles on it, and we have not had a single problem. We love almost everything about the car. It gets decent gas mileage-we are averaging 29 mpg city/highway combo. It has an excellent safety rating in Consumer Reports. It comes in some way cool colors. There is one issue we have: the back window is too small, so sometimes I'm nervous changing lanes, especially on the freeway. Anyway, it's a cute little car that does what it says it will do. In the Valley, you'll pay a little more-ours 14000 with no extras.",3
2323,"I purchased SI about one month ago and I still get excited when I get to drive it. Simply a blast to drive. I came from a Nissan altima 3.5SL which was sneaky fast in a straight line but handled horribly. This car handles awesomely with only slightly less performance. This is without the summer tires. I live near St. Louis and we usually see at least some snow so opted for the all seasons. Best of all I can drive the heck out of it and get 28 mpg (yes I use the vtec). That is the lowest I have gotten since owned usually getting 29 mpg. Granted it is premium fuel, but I usually got 25 mpg with less aggressive driving in the altima. Excellent fit and finish.",4
2324,"Goodbye Honda Pilot - work horse. Hello Enclave - luxmobile ! Everyday enjoy it more and more. Spacious, very quiet, smooth ride, handles very nicely, and has lots of admirers - strangers just stopping to take a look or ask about it. Loving it.",4
2325,"I have been wanting a Matrix for the last two or three years, and I finally got one at the end of 2007! It is the best car I have ever owned, and it is so much fun to drive! I don't regret for minute buying it, and not only is is sporty and cute, it's very comfortable! I'm 5'4, but I have people who are over 6'0 tall riding in my care on a regular basis, and they all agree it is comfortable as well! This is my first Toyota, and I believe they have me for life now!",4
2326,"I had a 2003 Saab 9-3, but did not want to spend 30 plus for another car and the headache of a ""european import"". The Civic Si is as fun, or more fun to drive than the Saab 9-3 was. The Saab was fun to drive that is when it was not in the shop. Think twice before a 30-40 thousand dollar car and check out the Si! A fantastic little pocket rocket inside and out!",3
2327,"The 2008 Patriot is ""most excellent"". Considering that I got a relatively maxed out 4x4 limited for $23,500, it is truly an outstanding value. I did choose the 5 speed manual over the automatic and am quite pleased with the result. Handling is nimble and I like the Jeep styling. Have logged over 9K miles in less than 6 months. Had one experience in very slippery snow conditions, and found it had better traction than my '94 Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4. Fuel mileage has been 25 - 28 mpg for combined highway/city driving. The Boston acoustic speakers are outstanding - it is terrific for tailgating. Space utilization is excellent. Like the interior materials and they are easy to keep clean.",3
2328,"Was completely impressed with the Cx9. After searching for six months, we narrowed it down to the Volvo XC90 and the CX9. We chose the CX9 because of the available technology, comfort and style.",4
2329,"Bought car then set off for North Carolina. Handled great on freeways. Gas consumption above anticipated level. Great car to drive. Recommend it highly. Wife likes it, too! Go Chrysler...keep 'em coming",4
2330,"This car was a big disappointment after driving it for a couple of weeks. The engine, build quality, fuel economy, and fun to drive factor were all there. However, the seating position and lack of a dead pedal left me feeling very uncomfortable. The gas pedal is too close to the driver, which resulted in constantly lifting one's foot off the accelerator in order to properly control the throttle. Move the seat back too far and you can't reach the clutch and steering wheel. Also the lack of a dead pedal (or even a flat spot), leaves one's foot on a round bump. This was such a shame because the car really zips around and is fun to drive.The new FIT is out this fall & I advise to wait.",1
2331,"Just got the Sequoia last weekend and I'm wondering why it took us so long to find the perfect family SUV. We had an 03 Expedition that was acting up. Figure we'd give Toyota a try since big Ford has let us down on what was suppose to be our 10 year SUV. For being a full size SUV, this machine drives like a car. Suspension is much nicer and acceleration is super smooth. I never thought I'd ever switch to a Japanese SUV for fear that it's not roomy enough for my family but I'm sure glad now. Definitely made the right decision. The design is well thought out for families that need to drive 3 kids in car seats. Love the fact that the 2nd row slides forward for easier access to 3rd row.",4
2332,Just took delivery on an X3. The mileage has been a pleasant surprise. The vehicle is well built and feels very solid. The transmission is not up to par with the rest of the vehicle. It doesn't shift smoothly and hesitates.,3
2333,"We were looking at small SUVs (CRV, Santa Fe, RAV4) and decided to check out the Outback as well. What a difference! The ride is so much better. Subaru is a much safer and more reliable car than the others we looked at. The exterior is much improved and the interior is very simple. This is our ""baby car"", so we are happy the car seat is easy to install and the cargo space is awesome. The 170 hp engine isn't great, but is still muc better than the models I listed above. I tested all the models on a nasty hill near our house and the Outback actually performed the best.",4
2334,"I love my Enclave! Already made one trip from Ontario to Florida with two golden retrievers and a roof rack full of stuff! No problems. Took 6 people out and about down there on day trips, all comfortable. I too can only find the tailgate button on the keyfob while inside, is there a button? Other than on the tailgate? Which also had to be fixed...it would power up then drop closed! Easy fix. Have 23,000 k's on it as we speak and I can go 740 k's on one tank. Did I mention I love my Enclave?",4
2335,"This is our third Kia and couldn't be happier. The Sorento handles great and has a very solid and quiet ride. All of the controls are in easy reach of the driver. I feel better knowing that I have a full size spare tire instead of a ""donut"". I commute 90 miles a day and feel safer in a Kia than any other vehicle I have ever owned. We have found all of our Kia vehicles to be of the highest quality. Their vehicles are luxury quality at an economical price. Kia offers one of the best warranties around which we have never had to take advantage of. Kia has higher specifications for their vehicles, dealerships, sales and service of any other make of vehicle we have ever owned.",4
2336,"Had a 1995 Legacy wagon that aspired to be an Outback. Years later, I bought the car I always wanted! My big feet took some getting used to in the footbox, not to say that it is cramped, but pedals are closer than my Honda. I am no WRC racer, but I do like how easy the clutch engages and shifting action feels great. Is surprisingly responsive when passing, especially for a four banger that is a bit heavy in the hips. Excited for the snow and rain, I'd like to see how the AWD handles it. Mileage is better than expected, 27+ in 50/50 city/hwy (as long as the dash computer is correct).",4
2337,"This car is OK, nothing special, it was a cheap lease. I had a VW Golf which blows the Subaru away in overall performance and quaility. The Subaru doors close like a tin can, power in the engine is non-exsitent, and the road noise is high. But it is new and get about 24 MPG, not bad for an AWD",2
2338,"Only driven about 1000 miles so far I love the my gig, though I am just getting used to the operation. The drive is solid, with solid steering and decent brakes. I did get the 4.0 engine, and compared to the 3.8, it was well worth it. very easy to pass on the highway, and sporty in town, more than any minivan has the right to. Some of the electronic automation (tri zone temp) is not yet intuitive, but is becoming less obtrusive, (who reads the manual anyway?) Only problem we had so far was the my gig would cut out over every bump in the road. Easy fix-loose fuse. A lot of storage space, loads of floor space. So far, I am glad I purchased this over the competition.",3
2339,"I have always owned Camry's and was a die hard Toyota driver. With price being an issue dwhen shopping for a new car, I test drove every make and model out there. I kept going back to the Saturn and test drove it 3 times. hands down quality and price won out and I choose a Saturn. It still smells like new inside and has been a great car and one that I plan on keeping for a while. The sleek looks and gas mileage are a very big added bonus. Pay attention Toyota because you just lost a customer for life!",4
2340,"Love the looks, interior, exterior, handling, fuel economy, and the MyGig is a must have. Chill Zone Drink Cooler, Safety features and rear seat leg room are all well over normal expectations.",4
2341,"Was looking at the Jeep Liberty and other SUV's. Was skeptical about the Compass because of some reviews. The Compass drives more like a car and much better comfort than the Jeep Liberty IMO. Bought the FWD auto, and the power is very adequate and the ride is very smooth and quiet. Goes down the freeway at 70mph no problem. The paint finish is great. This is the wife's daily driver and she loves the comfort, style, overall handling. We bought it for town and freeway driving, not off-road. Jeep has a winner in the price group. Would recommend the 26E package and Drivers Convenience group if you like a little more power options and gadgets.",3
2342,"The car is very fast (6.0 is great), handles great, and is very hard to find. Dealer looked for weeks before we found a GT that would do. It still was not the color we wanted (we got red wanted gray, but car does turn heads) nor did it have the performance package, but it does have the sunroof and leather. Great seats, great steering, really really fast. Dealer only discounted $500 off the sticker, but still good value for so much car.",3
2343,"I wrote about my car shortly after receiving it in 2007. Here we are nearly two years later, and I still love it. No mechanical problems at all. Gas mileage is still mediocre (25mpg at very best, all highway driving, more like 18 in the city . . .) but understandable when there's so much power on tap. Seats continue to be completely supportive even after two years. Just wanted to chime in and say that the enthusiastic glow that so many of us feel right after buying a car has continued with this one. My favorite car I have ever owned, and that includes a long string of Audis, BMWs and various Japanese makes. No regrets whatever.",4
2344,"I was looking for a coupe so I checked out Nissan, Honda and Toyota. They all were ok but something just didn't feel right with any of them. I was driving past a Pontiac dealer and spotted the G6 coupe and it was love at first sight. It had everything I was looking for and more. Once I took a test drive and talked price I was sold. I paid $8-10,000 LESS than I would have paid for the Nissan, Honda or Toyota. Once I started driving it and checked my gas mpg I couldn't believe it. On the highway I'm getting 28-30 mpg and city is 23-25 mpg and it isn't even broken in yet!! As a added benefit the car is made in the USA, it looks like American workers can do a good job too.",4
2345,"I recently traded in my 2004 Ford F150 for a 2008 Fusion 4cyl SE. I dont miss the V8 like I though I would, but i love my current fuel economy. The 4cyl engine has a lot of power considering the size. Great overall comfort too. Almost got leather, but didnt really need it. Handles great in traffic and on the curves.",3
2346,"We've had this for 3 days now. It's a very nice car/truck. My wife had a BMW 528i wagon, and was a little leery of trading 'down' to a GM. After a few days she's over that. It drives very nice. All passengers sit nice and high so there's great visibility. There's a nice feel of security in this vehicle. It drives like a car but has the road presence of a truck. And it feels like it's put together very well. Heated seats, mirrors, great stereo, parking assist... It's full featured and gives off a great confidence. GM is back with this one!",3
2347,"Bought this car new. Driven mostly highway miles to/from work. Bluetooth module didn't work when I bought it. Fit & finish items at 5k, same issues now but it's no longer under warranty. Interior rattles out the wazoo. New Engine 24K. Tires 30K. New Transmission 59K. Replaced CV boots 59K. Days in shop since I've owned it, 68. Still making the vibrations in the drivetrain & ""they can't figure it out"". Only 500 miles left on the warranty. Bet they'll figure it out as soon as I have to pay for it. Best mpg 30, worst mpg 22, average mpg 26. Owned Nissans before but NEVER AGAIN!!",0
2348,This is a great car getting 34 mph highway with a manual. Capable of 150- 200 K easy. Too bad it takes Toyota to design such a great car for GM.,3
2349,"The exterior is awesome! The interior looks fantastic and is very functional. However, I am on my second one....I used Saturn's 30 day return policy. The first one had huge transmission issues and shipping damage I found after delivery. THe dealership stepped right up and provided an exchange, no questions asked. My second one seems fine, just don't expect to step on the gas and go anywhere quick. The transmission is also extremely sluggish. If you can afford the v6, this would be a fantastic SUV. But if you're like me, you have to live with the 4cyl.",2
2350,"I have purchased my Sienna for about 8 months. It's a great van. It has a lot of power and is very comfortable to drive. It is roomy and its built quality is excellent. I get about 21 to 23.8 mpg for mixed driving. On freeway driving, I get about 25 to 26 mpg.",3
2351,"Overall this car is awesome. Great car for the price. This is my 2nd VW (1998 Jetta TDI ) and I enjoy driving it. Not a long distance driver, but has all the essentials for city driving. Great tuner car for those small little quirks, i.e. braking, body roll. Basic model looks a little bland but add some sport springs, nice wheels and some window tint and it takes a little step closer to GTI appeal. Could save a little more money on gas with a 6th gear.",3
2352,"We cross shopped Audi A6, Q7, Infiniti M35x, Cadilac CTS4, Acura TL and RL, after we returned a 2006 BMW 530xiT. We finally decided to lease an RL because it has all the basic elements of being a luxury car. This is the 4th Honda/Acura we had owned so far. And probably the most conservative Honda/Acura we ever have. Having said that, the RL is still a wonderful car to drive. Only hope 3 years later, Acura can have another face lift base on the coming 2009 RL (it is NOT attractive at all) plus a RWD-biasd AWD. Then I think we will continue to be in the Honda's family.",3
2353,"I was shopping for a new Cadillac, but fell in love with 2007 Suburban. It drives and rides better. My 1992 has 210,000 miles and still does not use a quart oil between changes. So far my new one is great. I average 16 miles in town and that's better than my friend's Highlander's 15. For me and my needs our Suburban is great. It's funny all my friends drive small imports, but they aways want me to drive. My taste, guess I am use to my 1992,",3
2354,"I've had the Patriot for a few months and absolutely love it. I bartered down big time, so they gave me a very BASIC package but I'm not looking for luxury. I drive 80 miles round trip to work, daily, and couldn't be happier. My AVERAGE mileage has been 30+ MPG. Throw in the lifetime FULL warranty, I'm comforted by the fact if anything busts, it's covered (well worth the exta few bucks a month). Rides great, TONS of room (I'm 6'1 and don't even have the seat all the way back easily can handle someone even taller). Plan on easily adding on features later DIY transmission cooler and hitch, can tow 2000 lbs.",4
2355,"Purchased Veracruz LTD AWD in February 2009. The vehicle handles exceptionally smooth, is well equipped with many standard features and is a complete joy to drive. The sound system is decent and came equipped with the DVD package. A surprising feature NOT included is a jack for an Ipod. Gas mileage hovers around 20 mpg. Not great but comparable to other vehicles in it's class. I would recommend Hyundai as a vehicle brand for people to seriously consider. With the amount of rebates on this particular vehicle, the strength of it's warranty and the assurance plan in place, you cannot go wrong.",3
2356,"My wife and I have been wanting a new Tahoe for over a year. With the 0% and all we still couldn't afford much more than a base model LS. But we found a leftover 2008 LT with the LT2 package, plus second row bucket seats & third row vinyl seats. MSRP was over $42K, after Red tag and additional rebates we paid $31K. Even with paying 5% interest we were able to afford way more car than with the 0% sales. Go find a 2008 Tahoe now, you have the power to buy it for next to nothing!",3
2357,"Fun, fun, fun. The most fun car I have driven. Tested the 350Z, BMW, Altima, Accord, this is the best. And affordable! It is a 3rd car in the family with a truck and a sedan, so we could get away with a 2 seater. If you buy it it will make you smile, I keep looking for reasons to drive",4
2358,"Shopped for while... Mercedes, BMW... test drove all. All great but Q7 won. Special ordered, S-line, adaptive cruse and adaptive suspension together was worth waiting for. Love line assist and parking assist system. Bought 16GB USB drive and have all my favorite music at my steering wheel controls.",3
2359,"My wife and I have been driving this SUV for a month. It is a great value for the amount of items included. We bought the Limited FWD version for $26,000.00. You can't buy a HONDA CRV for this amount with a 4 cylinder. Only one problem so far, the seat memory switch had to be changed. Dealer is great to work with. The Infinity stereo is OK not great, but overall still very pleased with the quality of the vehicle. Third row seating is great. Gas mileage so far is about 18 MPG (city driving) not to bad considering. Love the safety features. Honda, Lexus/Toyota can learn something from Hyundai. The are overpriced and over rated.",3
2360,"I was looking for an SUV and decided to check out the Dodge Nitro. Didn't like the ride at all, too hard. Noticed the Avenger on the lot and thought it looked classy. Test drove it and unexpectantly fell in love..Purchased on a whim, on the spot. Love this vehicle!",4
2361,"Coming from a Honda Civic the Sierra 1500 feels like a monster. What a dream to drive. I actually enjoy driving to work now. One of the first things I noticed was how quiet the ride is. With the windows up road noise is virtually none existent. I've been getting around 16.6mpg with all around driving. I suspect that will go up as the motor breaks in, but hey if you're looking for fuel economy buy a prius and just hope that someone in a 1500 doesn't hit you. I highly recommend getting the remote start option. I always start the truck a few minutes before I leave and it either turns on the heater or AC depending on the inside temp of the truck. Nothing like hoping into the perfect climate.",3
2362,"It is a 08.5, just turned 12000 miles and not a problem. I looked at all the options out there, Toyota, Ford, and Chevy. Toyota was my #1 choice but to get a crew cab you only got a 5.5 ft bed what would you do with that. I looked and compared trucks for six months. I never considered the Nissan until my wife took me over to the dealer and I have yet to look back. I Like It. It has all the options and some. I drive 60% Highway and 40% everything else. I am averaging 15 to 16.5 mpg. The 7 ft bed is great, room for all the gear, ATV, and the deer. The only thing I did not like, it is hard to find an off road friendly tire in the 20in rim with out putting on a lift.",3
2363,"I sold my Audi A4 3.2 to my son and drove to Roadshow BMW, Memphis, TN to look at a Mini Cooper S. Drove out with a BMW 135i! They were great to deal with. I test drove one in Little Rock last summer and didn't realize how fast it is. I now understand what BMW mean by Ultimate Driving Machine! The A4 is a great car but the 135i is even better. The car is much quicker, the handling is better, road feel is better and it's quieter.",4
2364,"When we went searching for a new car, I had my heart set on a '07 RAV4. Husband wanted me to look at a CR-V before my final decision. Glad I did! I'm happier with the fold down table in the middle of the front bucket seats. I'm glad the hatch swings up and not into traffic. I added the removable tray in the back which is a dream after a trip to the store, and the gas mileage is wonderful. I didn't have to change oil for the first time till it hit 8,000 miles! And yes it is true for us, the CR-V was 15% less to insure because it doesn't have the spare hanging on the back. I've driven it for a little over a year now, and cannot find one thing wrong. And I got the entry level AWD!",4
2365,"This was an upgrade from a 95 Dodge Neon, so it didn't take much to make me happy. Very happy driving my new car!",3
2366,"Beats the pants off of my go mango Daytona!. You have to be careful with these SRT's as they hit high speeds pretty darn fast!. The Daytona was a great car (got totaled by an abandoned previously wrecked vehicle in the middle of a darkened highway, very sad) and a bit more comfortable as well as confident due to the less aggressive gearing and pc. I absolutely love the SRT!.",4
2367,"I owned a 2000 Honda Civic Si a couple of years ago and then decided to go SUV. After seeing the body style of the new 2007 Si, I knew I had to go back. This car is such an improvement from the old Si. It's gorgeous and zippy! I love the handling and the interior display. Honda did a great job at putting bells and whistles in this car for a decent price. It was hard to find one with a navi and I was told I would have to wait a month and I couldn't wait. Luckily I don't get lost too often to need one. This car is worth every cent.",4
2368,"Have owned truck for almost 600 miles and really enjoy the truck. It has 5.3 V8 with the Flex Fuel Management. City driving is ok, highway is a lot better. For a base model, it came fully loaded with all power options, CD, cruise, fog lights, chrome bumpers, towing package, XM, and OnStar (which I think XM and OnStar were standard). Truck can ride rough over unkept streets, but still a lot better than my old Chevrolet Tracker. Air and heat are great. Can't wait to try the 4x4!",3
2369,"MPG! MPG! MPG! I am commuting 65 miles one way and need my Corolla to rescue me. I have check MPG yesterday and it was 41.6 MPG (gas tank was less than half full), average driving speed was 65-70 MPH and A/C was on most of the time (speed 1 since it was not very hot). The motor is very quiet and road noise level is very low for a car of this size. This car has exceeded all my expectations!",4
2370,"The car is great for the price. If you're buying it to throw a bunch of money into mods however, I would suggest you move up to the Civic Si. The tC has two fundamental flaws that enthusiasts will have to spend a lot of money to overcome. One is the lack of an LSD, and the other is the glass roof. The glass roof makes the car heavy at a place you want a car to be as light as possible. If you're looking for an affordable, good looking, reliable, daily driver with a hint of sportiness, this is the car for you.",3
2371,"I traded in my 2002 V6 Mustang for a 2008 EX Civic back in November and it's the smartest thing I've ever done for many reasons. As a former Ford man who always trashed Honda, I have to say I LOVE THIS CAR! The gas mileage is incredible for the amount of fun you can have. I'm 5'11'' and I feel totally comfortable in it driving for hours. Not to mention, the VTEC in it is plenty powerful enough stock - let alone the abundance of aftermarket parts. The 8th generation Civic is a winner for sure.",4
2372,"Looked for a replacement for my BMW SUV. The Enclave caught my eye with its sleek design, stylish interior. The fit and finish is first class, the engineering is current, and the price is $15 to $20 below the BMW. First new American car I've gotten for myself in almost 40 years. Not your grandfather's Buick! Will help bring quality reputation back to the marque.",3
2373,My Silverado 1500 Classic has already had to have the rotors and drums turned! What has happened to Chevy's quality? It took the dealership-2 tries to even figure out what was going on. In town driving only--it has the tow pkg--which I don't use. The mpg is horrible. Have been a Chevy family for a long time but no more.,1
2374,"2008 Rallye Sport in black looks very sharp! Sticked for about 22,500, but jeep gave me 2,500 back, a generous trade and I under 5% financing, so... So far, very good. Good pep with a 5 speed manual and good gas mileage (24- 28 is pretty accurate). GREAT Boston Acoustics sound system (I have the 9 speaker system including flip down tailgate speakers). Interior look average, exterior look pretty sharp. Handles and drives very well. Good roomy interior (compared to my small sedan, so...) Drawbacks: cheap looking dash, but simple and logical; no MP3 jack on the 6 CD changer stereo; hatchback side windows don't crack open",3
2375,"I thought I would keep my Honda CR-V forever. It was 10 years old but I didn't like anything else out there (including the new ones). Sat in the SX4 Crossover at the Auto Show in Cleveland and fell in love. I'm getting 28 MPG driving back and forth to work. I do wish it had a bigger gas tank because with the miles I drive (over 400 a week) I have to fill up twice a week, but otherwise I love this car. It is quieter than my Honda and rides very nice. I've gotten quite a few complements on it and a lot of questions because there aren't many Suzuki dealerships in the area.",3
2376,"Over the past 9 years I have purchased 4 Toyota products and this one is by far the best. My last purchase was a 2004 Highlander which my wife and I really enjoyed. You can't beat the overall performance of the engine and transmission. It actually feels like the vehicle is not running and at the same time just wants to take off. Outstanding performance. Ample room and at the same time, I can't see a whole lot of difference between this and the Highlander I owned. Our first choice was the Limited addition but chose the sport because of the darker seats and dash.",4
2377,"We had originally test drove the Vue to eliminate it from our list of vehicle options, just so we could say that we had actually looked at all of our options within the price range we set for ourselves. But instead of eliminating it, it moved to the top of the list. Of the vehicles that we looked at, the Vue Red Line was the only one that we walked away from the test drive with that ""gotta have it"" feeling. It had all the power we wanted, looked great, a smooth quiet ride, and it drove like it was on rails. If you are looking for a sporty compact SUV, don't dismiss the Vue Red Line until you have actually driven it.",4
2378,"I only bought the car about ten days ago so it is much too early to comment on the reliability or long term comfort level of the interior. However, so far I really like the car. It is fun to drive and performs very well. As everyone else has already said the backseats are very small but I will always be sitting in the driver's seat so what does it matter? This is my first car. I have always owned trucks before but with the cost of gasoline and me living half way up a mountain I needed an efficient AWD. The Subaru fit the bill. My only fill up so far has resulted in 25.97 MPG which I imagine will only get better come engine break- in and non winter blend gas. Great car for the money!",3
2379,"I bought this car to replace a truck and a mini-van. It did that and more. Drives like a car, has the utility of a truck, and the comfort has surprised me. I have used it for family vacations, football tailgating, commuting, hauling large items to the dump, taking the dog swimming, and kayak fishing. I plan to go camping in it this spring. It is without a doubt the most useful and fun vehicle to drive and own that I have ever had!!!",4
2380,Zippy 6-speed wagon in a color to match...Montego blue. Handles well and grips the road. Run-flat tires don't add noise like my former X3. Gas mileage is excellent with the manual transmission.,3
2381,Not only is this car beautiful from the outside it has a great interior. I live in a climate where it snows half of the year (basically) and I have never had a car that handles so well in the snow/ice. This car almost handles like a 4 wheel drive vehicle on the road at the worst of times. The Germans know how to make a great vehicle!,4
2382,"I bought this truck to replace a 2003 Toyota Tacoma. I went with the TRD package because I love the look. I drive 90 miles a day so comfort and reliability are also very important. After reading several reviews I went with the 5.7L V8 and man am I glad. This truck is pure fun. The ride is smooth and comfortable. My wife doesn't want to drive her Expedition anymore! I'm not a big truck guy but this thing is perfect for people looking for the convenience of a truck and the ride of a car. The truck is big so people need to be aware that parking can be tight. With that said all I can say is, Toyota did it once again. Great job!",4
2383,"Headed down to my Ford garage to buy my third Explorer, but really didn't want to face another 5 years of sub 20 MPG at $4.00 per gallon. Dealer suggested trying the new Edge. After trial, bought one. I have owned it for about one month and I like it. It is the only vehicle I have ever owned that people on the street turn and look at. My neighbors all came over to see the car that can drive on the edge of buildings. Haven't tried that yet. The suspension is much softer than the Explorer and other truck-based vehicles. This will take a while to get used to. I am hoping for average mileage North of 20 MPG. Too soon to tell.",3
2384,"I bought my CR-V about a week ago and I absolutely love it. Everyone raves about how nice this car looks. I got it in Glacier Blue and it's so beautiful - in my opinion the best color this car comes in. I'm already averaging 27 mpg with highway/city driving. I love sitting up high and the visibility is so much better than my old sedan. This SUV handles and corners like a car, going down ramps with tight turns is no problem, however, it does lack in acceleration, but I've gotten used to that. I'm not out racing anyone, but getting up to speed on the highways is tricky. Other than that, I love it!",3
2385,"The car looks great and has a fantastic ride, The kids love the dual dvd's and the satelite radio is easy to use for us. The ride is smooth and it handles very well.",3
2386,"I have owned several MB before, but this one is a car that stands uo to a BMW in ride, and size. The performance is excellence as well as the handling. My car has two option the i-pod in the glove box a waste for me, but not my kids. Also the optional headlamps which are great for lighting your way. I strongly suggest this option for older folks, it help alot. So far the car is great, and the fuel economy is not bad either in the upper 20's combine with city and highway. This car is a lot for the buck, and truely a great value. This car car hums like a bimmer, and rides like a tank as a Mercedes should be.",4
2387,"I wanted a car that had good gas mileage, was sporty-looking and had a lot of interior room. I have dogs and with the back seats folded down, there is plenty of room for dogs or cargo. The seats are very comfortable compared to some of the other smaller vehicles I have driven. The HHR is perfect for what I wanted in a car.",4
2388,"An excellent family hauler. I love the remote start feature where it turns on the heater and seat warmers or AC depending on the temperature. Drives great, rides great, excellent steering, nice interior touches and the great exterior appearance. Very comfortable seats. Tows our camper with ease, but there is always a need for more HP and torque.",3
2389,This is the first new car I have ever bought. Fun to drive and looks very stylish. I definitely get looks from other drivers. The fuel economy is marginal at best.,3
2390,"I recently got this Jeep and I can't tell you how much fun I am having. First of all it is really sharp and commands attention. It has plenty of power for such a heavy SUV. It rides very smooth, and it does run very quiet! Everything is within easy reach, and easy to use. I am really enjoying having a sunroof-some people asked me if it was a new Hummer. I tell them the Hummers have copied and mine is all Jeep! Good job Jeep",4
2391,"I moved into this car from an '07 IS250 and have never looked back. While it is not the same Tron-like driving experience, I could not ask for a more appropriate car for travelling with my family. It has all the space we need, decent mpg and is amazingly comfortable for short or long trips. We chose this over a SUV because the large trunk will keep items from hitting the kids if we are ever rear-ended. We were already t-boned once by a RAV-4 whose driver had a senior moment, and we were able to drive away with no injuries and less damage than she had.",4
2392,"I've had my 2008 V6 4WD Rav4 for a week and lovin' every minute of drivining it. I've already tested the PSI warning light as I had a nail in the tire within a few days of purchasing. Had the light not gone on, I suspect I would have had a flat tire vs. being able to check it out before it went completely flat. Engine very quiet - to the point it sounds like it stalled. It's the perfect size - takes up the same space in the garage as my Volvo S70 - maybe even a little less space.",3
2393,"Have had the vehicle for two weeks. I regularly transport 5 passengers, so a 6-seater was a must. Impressed with the leg room in all seats, and my kids love all of the compartments to put their stuff. It has 12 cup holders! The third row is easily accessible with a kid-friendly pop-up middle seat. This was an improvement over other makes we looked at. From a driver's standpoint, I am having trouble getting used to a middle console. I miss the floor space in my minivan. I also do not care for the steering wheel. It doesn't adjust very much. I do love the adjustable gas pedal and brake pedal. This keeps me from having to sit so close to the steering wheel, making the airbag safer.",3
2394,"I've now put 3500 miles on my Tiburon. We seem to be getting used to one another. So far I am very happy with my sporty little ride. I get compliments often and lookers regularly. I am really enjoying it and it's overall performance it plenty for me. Never thought I would want a sports [or in this case just sporty] car, but I'm glad I did. I've read reviews containing comments about the lack of leg room in the back seat. Come on, does anyone expect back seat leg room in a sports car.",3
2395,"This is MY first VW, and my family's twelfth, so I am a little biased on my love for the car. The fit and finish is luxury level, the ride quality is (for me) close enough to my old 3- series BMW that I can't justify the added expense of the BMW anymore. The only complaint I have is the rear brakes which seems to be a common complaint here. I will say this though, having had to replace the pads nearly every oil change, I will continue to pay for that hydraulic braking system. That braking system has saved my life on LA freeways more times that I care to admit! This is one of those cases of parts bin engineering but when your parts bin is ""hand-me-downs"" from Porsche...",3
2396,"With just 200 miles on the odometer, this car already says it all, power, comfort, and agility. There are probably other cars with more of each, but this one has a nice balance of all three. The Harmon Kardon sound system is worth the upgrade. However, the sound from the engine is even better. Just wish it had ""real"" fuel and temp gauges.",3
2397,"I was only window shopping, but fell in love with this car. I never thought I would own a small car again. It's silver with a sunroof, and as everyone says....it's fun to drive. It has every feature I was looking for. I did not shop around for other small cars. This was the one I HAD to have.",4
2398,"I was very impressed with the drive and style of my new Acadia. I feel that the transmission would run more efficiant had it been larger. Sometime the transmission dosen""t know what to do. I took it for a 15 hr one way road trip to Tampa, Florida and it drove great other than giving me the advertised fuel mileage. Overall I get many looks of impressed people when I drive it. GMC has to be commended for a job well done, makes you want to keep buying American.",3
2399,I have had this car for about 3 months and in general I love it. Like the review below mine sometimes it doesn't turn over when starting like it should. This happens randomly and for no apparent reason. My only major complaint is the rear bumper. I think it is made poorly and within the first month I noticed a rock had hit the underside of the tire casing and made a notch in the paint. After closer inspection I noticed that there is another part where the paint is pulling away where the metal body and plastic bumper of the car meet. You can hardly see it now but I fear in time it will grow. My biggest suggestion would be to examine your bumper before purchasing this car!,3
