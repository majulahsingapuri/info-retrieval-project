18455,08/27/2008,tjl,"Owned this 07 GL320 CDI for 15 months. Overall fuel efficiency has been 22.7 mpg through 20500 miles. On the highway, we've gotten up to 28 mpg, and always 20+ around town. Very comfortable on long trips or short commutes. Handled heavy winter snowfall in Spokane and North Idaho with ease. Couple of items to be aware of when purchasing. Uses synthetic Mobil 1, so oil changes are every 10- 12k. Oil light comes on occassionally. Dealer states it's a computer glitch that hasn't yet been corrected. OE tires (we have Continental 4x4 Contact 18"") are worn out and need to be replaced.","Great ride. Great handling. Goes a long, long way between fill-ups!",2007,mercedes-benz,gl-class,4
9534,04/07/2008,Brad,"This is my fourth Explorer and they just keep getting better! The features, versatility and the price can't be beat. The V-6 fuel ecomomy isn't great but, I get the same MPG that I got with my Acura MDX and I don't have to run premium fuel. The Sirius radio and Sync system are great. Towing two SEA- Doo's GTX's takes a little effort, but the vehicles handles and stops well. The third row seats are great for kids under twelve and I love the power up and down feature. The second row seats recline but they do take a little effort to move up and out so people can get into the third row.","Sync, Sirius, Class 3/4 trailer hitch set-up with two different types of electrical plug ins, Power fold 3rd row seats.

Very solid car and fun to drive. When I park it in the garage at night, I can hardly wait until the next morning to drive it again. Do yourself a favor, go drive one. You won't regret it.",The blue backlit displays are awesome. The sound system is also very nice.,2007,hyundai,tiburon,5
7395,12/28/2008,crasberry,I realized in the 1st tank of gas that I wasn't getting the MPG that Saturn told me I would get. The vehicle is rated at 16 MPG city but we struggle to get 12. It would be different if the vehicle was driven hard but it's driven very slow in a fairly small town that you don't drive over 35 MPH. I've had the vehicle back to 2 Saturn dealerships 4 times and they can't seem to figure out why it gets the poor mileage. The last Saturn dealer told me they drove it and got over 16 MPG. I offered to ride with them to verify their claim and they refused. My wife loves the vehicle but if I knew it was going to get 12 MPG I would have bought another vehicle with a V-8 engine.,The vehicle drives great and has plenty of room for my grandkids.,2008,saturn,outlook,3

The gas mileage is awesome. We have gotten 29-30mpg on the HWY, and 22-24 in combined city/hwy driving.

11565,01/11/2009,Blazinjoe,"Car is so quiet and smooth. Luv the bigger V-6, almost unnoticeable when it shifts. SE has very nice interior. Very comfortable. Great mileage...21 local...24 highway. Better mileage than 2003 which had small V-6. Had 2003 Santa Fe 5 years..enjoyed it so much there was no question when we went to look for a new car. No mechanical probs on the 2003 & after I'd wash it it looked like new car even after 5 years. When u consider the price & warranty, my 2008 Santa Fee is a ""no-brainer""!","Steering wheel controls are nice. Was a great idea when they replaced the light carpets in the 2008...the '07 had light carpet w/light interiors even in cargo area. Wife said ""no way"" we get the car that way.

150,07/16/2008,Franchise,"Great car, very fast, big enough for a big guy (6'-4"" size 18 shoes) to fit very comfortably. It feels a little less powerful than it actually is until you realize how much faster your going than everyone around you, its pretty smooth for a car that handles well and accelerates so fast. It would be nice if they would make a less expensive, stripped down coupe version of the G8 that could fill the void where the firebird used to be, the solstice just doesn't cut it with no v8 and being so small a 5th grader can barely get in it",V8 Rear wheel drive standard premium audio system in the GT,2008,pontiac,g8,5

But when you compare all of the features and standard stuff, the Suzuki really blows them away. Adding the no deductible, 7 year 100,000 mile warranty, free loan car, that covers exerything except the battery and tires! Even a burned out bulb is covered! Amazing. And the Japanese made GM motor is smooth and powerful, and all the safety stuff gets is a 5 star rating.","The goodies included, the warranty, the looks!",2008,suzuki,xl7,5
7158,04/08/2009,kenosmom,"Bought this car new for practical reasons (not a 4 door sedan type person), and overall a decent car. Smoothest engine I've ever heard, bar none! CVT transmission works well and gas mileage averaged over 30 mpg. But overall a pretty boring drive. Handling is average, driver's seat too soft and lacks lumbar support, sun visor hits mirror when lowered, (bumper cover popped off, panels don't align well).","SMOOTH engine, gas mileage, CVT transmission, nice trunk space, nice standard sound system.",2008,nissan,sentra,4
18075,06/05/2006,gjk,"In the approximately 3 weeks we have had the black on black wagon we have been stopped repeatedly by people asking what type of car is it, what year is it, is it a BMW, etc. We had 2002 Audi A6 wagon for the last four years and did not give anything up by getting this car except for saving a bunch of money. Its fit and finish are top notch, its engine excellent, its stlying is sharp, and its ride is fun. Get the sport package for no other reason than the sport seats which are much better than the ""comfort"" seats. Also it has metal on dash instead of wood for a little more sporty appearance. This car is loaded with features and technology. We also looked at BMW 325xi and Subaru Outback but this was by for the best for the money. We have had no problems to date.","The engine, power liftgate, room, looks, active xenon headlights...its really a complete package.",2007,volkswagen,passat,5
21204,12/17/2006,rideordie,"I've had my max for a few weeks now and I love it. I've driven many V6's but this CVT is, by far, the smoothest, and one of the quickest. It adjusts to your driving style so when your taking it easy, it drives in a higher gear for better fuel economy, and yes as someone said, it can feel a bit lethargic off the line in that mode. Feels like it starts in 2nd? However, if you drive a more aggressively, off the line, at 100 mph, or anywhere in between, this car is a beast! It automatically adjusts and rides in higher RPM's to stays in the ""sweet spot"" where are the power is. It's very sure-footed in corners with hardly no body roll, but feels a bit heavy. All around a quality built car.","Pretty much everything, but the monster engine and CVT tranny are great! Power is never too far away no matter which mode your in.

The value to cost ratio is excellent. I tend not to keep cars for over 3-4 years, so as for reliability, the Passat will probably work just fine or will be covered under warranty.

In those 6 months the top stopped working, the door locks and the cd player malfunctioned, the inside started rattling and squeaking, and the gas gauge broke. This was a 2007 NBC!

5831,07/28/2008,MYCAR,"We purchased this vehicle in Jan after searching for many months. Had a 6 cyl Ford Windstar minivan, and wanted SUV style w/o the high cost and poor gas milage. After 3300 miles, like other reviewers began hearing rattling noice in driver front side, as well as hesitation when accelerating. Brought back in at 8500 miles, and was told need new transmission! They have had to replace others. I just got the car back 3 days ago, and it STILL hesitates, however rattling is gone, for now. Loved this car, however not sure if it's going to last me many more years.

11296,11/19/2008,Kanthi Rameswaram,"A co-worker of mine gave me a ride to work one morning. She picked me up in her Acura RL. By the time we reached work I believe I repeated the phrase - ""this is a great car"" - about 5 times. Well I own one now, just completed one year of ownership. Let me tell you folks there is no better value for money in the luxury category. I compared the RL to the BMW 5 and the Audi A6 and I saved about $15k easily. The best car that I have owned bar none. You are surrounded in luxury and comfort. The AWD, steering and handling are superb. I wonder how I ever survived the LA labyrinth without my Acura nav system - it is amazing. The only negative is the rear middle seat, it is uncomfortable.","Navigation, AWD, steering, handling, Bose stereo system. The exterior design of the 2008 is better than the 2009 in my view.

Nice standard and satellite radio with MP3 hook up. Bought for my teenager but I enjoy driving it. Great price for the money. I could not beat it. Not sure of the gas mileage yet..

Took car to almost 130 - yeah, crazy me!! Car felt very smooth - can't feel the speed. I cruise on freeway and realize I have to ease on the pedal - I'm doing 90. Only 1 complaint - you feel the bumps too hard. Needs improvement on suspension. Yes, it has a sports suspension which has been lowered over the luxury model, but you sure feel those bumps.

It's a lot of fun to drive and can really hang the corners without feeling like it's going to roll over. It also pulls my boats just fine and is very stable. I don't feel the Jeep getting pushed around by the trailer like some smaller trucks tend to do. The take off power seemed a bit lacking but turning off the ESP seems to cure that, but this could just all be in my head because I like this ride so much.","Looks great and rides like a Jeep.

Now, almost a month later, I am riding shotgun in my husband's truck as the cable once again has ""disengaged"".

Just watch out out for potholes and speed bumps, and remember that it is a small, basically low powered car, that will still drive at 80 MPH if you want to - and maybe have to on the Interstates, where huge tractor-trailers often enjoy driving 5-10 feet behind you at that speed.

Drove every hybrid out there and thought the RX400h would be the one but there is really no comparison between the two. The RX is an older, noisier, less luxurious ride than the Highlander and, interestingly, very few people realize that. That may change in 2010 with the new RXh. This Highlander really excels in many areas. Mileage around town has been 26.5 mpg-better than we read here. It is very quiet and the intelligence of the interior layout is impressive. This is my wife's car and she's coming from a Lexus LS430 Ultra and she is more than satisfied.",Smart Key is very impressive. Locking and unlocking are easy and quick as is the start up of the car.

Before test driving several vehicles I had already sold myself on an Acadia. After the test drive the obvious winners were the 2009 Pilot and Toyota Highlander. We had looked at the Highlander a couple of years back but it was smaller and the dash was just plain ugly. The new redesign and the plush drive just did us both in. The Pilot would have offered a little more room but the dash looks like its made out of cheap plastic, and unless you get the all black interior the two tone effect was not very appealing to us.

Fortunately the airbag worked well. I was very happy with my 2006 Spectra but before I purchased another one, I wanted to see what other options I had. I drove every make and model out there and could find nothing else that I was more comfortable in or satisfied with than the Spectra, so I promptly purchased another one and have not had, even for a second, any regrets. I even turned down a purchase of a 2005 Jaguar that was selling for the same price as the Spectra. I found reviews of the Spectra to be more reliable than the Jag.","The gas mileage!! It's rated for about 34 mpg, but I routinely get 40+ mpg. I drive a stick shift, and I'm sure that helps a little bit. The gas mileage does take a bit of a dip, though, when the AC is used.

Two major options are the 17"" wheel sport package, which by the way is the only wheel package that you can get with the navigation system and the 3.6 luxury package.

The V6 is surprisingly powerful and quick for the MPG that you actually get. We are averaging 25.3 MPG so far.

Its arm rest is too high, it has a quirky engine, and the air didn't work very well. The Toyota Solara made for Grandmas. The Corvette is too common. At last we come to the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spider.

No other small hatchback, urban runabout or wagon comes close to the Fit, except perhaps the Scion xA. It is Storm Silver Metallic, sort of an almost charcoal grey, with black interior.

The car did, however achieve 26.5 mpg (going) and 24.2 mpg (returning) on a recent 360-mile trip. It's the in-city, stop-and-go travel, 95 percent of our driving, that is the killer.

My last car was a Chevy Tracker with 4 cylinders so I was skeptical to get another 4 cylinder, but once I drove it, I noticed a huge difference. The tracker was like trying to push an elephant up a hill. The CR-V isn't like that.

I took it back to the dealer and they had to lubricate the intermediate shaft in the steering column. The shades to the sunroof also broke, so they ordered new ones for me as well.

The sound of the engine will also take some getting used to as the turbo is a bit ""throatier"" than I'm used to. The car handles extremely well, though, hugging curves and accelerating very smoothly. The now-standard S-Line exterior features definitely give the car a sportier look. The interior is outstanding.

I could feel every tiny bump on the road, the steering wheel is very tight, therefore it's not very easy to maneuver. I also couldn't adjust the seat into a comfortable position, and was suffering from the back pain until I got used to it. I am 5,6"" and I guess this car is not for shorties. Moms, beware! The metal anchors are so deep, it took me about 20 minutes to install the car seat!

22059,12/07/2006,Randy,"This is my 2nd Silverado regular cab WT from this generation truck. Other than a rougher ride than I recall in the '04 I am fairly satisfied. The rough ride may be because GM converted to 17 inch wheels for gas mileage in '05 versus 16 inchers on the '04, or because one of the OEM General tires was noticeably out of round. Took a trip to the tire store to get it fixed, but still bumpier than I recall on the last one. So far it is averaging 17MPG in town with a lot of that being on the freeway at about 60MPH, so hopefully that will improve as the vehicle gets a bit more broken in.

Right after, various TSB's were performed for interior noises & passenger side front A-Pillar head air bag cover was replaced. Now I hear clanking in the suspension area when going over any type of bump or road imperfection.

Two things the Honda has over this: VCM (better mpg) and a more refined transmission.","Power doors and liftgate, stereo, engine power/torque (this thing gets up and goes), comfortable seats, 2 driver memory on drivers seat that recognizes key fobs.

I have the mid-grade LT1, front wheel drive model. It's easy to see out of fore and aft, so driving, parking and backing up is easy. The gas mileage is great; I have been averaging over 20 city/hiway and it only requires regular gas. Given I have only the mid level model; it doesn't drive sporty but is pretty agile. However, it can feel tipsy in very windy driving conditions, which makes the steering feel a too light. Upgraded models might mitigate this. Lastly, while the seats are comfy, they are a bit too soft on long drives.","Although not great sounding, the stereo as well as HVAC is easy to use and quickly cools/heats car; lit steering wheel controls are nice as is the on board computer showing miles to empty, tire pressure, etc. Lots of room for luggage and back seat passengers; good gas mileage.",2008,chevrolet,equinox,4

I had to put the car in PARK to start it again. Several times after, the car hesitated on acceleration. I told my dealer about this problem and made an appointment. The car stalled on them 3 times on testing. It ended up being the fuel canister (it was soaked), and was replaced. I was given a rental car. I am now experiencing the same problem, and will be taking the car back to the dealer this week (4/18/08), for what I suspect is the same problem. Has anyone else had this problem w/ their 2008 R32?

The vehicle is also prone to severe lunges when driving in m1 (such as you might in a parking garage looking for a spot or while moving forward in a metered freeway on ramp) and to a lesser extent in automatic. The lunges are dangerous and you must drive defensively at 4 miles per hour. BMW states the problem is with the software-it thinks the engine is stalling and the computer gives the engine throttle.

Other cars (CTS) are bigger, others are maybe better value propositions (G35x), but none match the driving experience.

Overall the Tundra is a great truck but like all other vehicles it could have some improvements. But Toyota does a lot of things to there vehicles that the domestic companies do not do like Toyota puts sealer on the edge door seams to keep from rusting and spray pvc under the vehicle and in the wheels wells to reduce road noise and to prevent rust, sprays antichip along rocker panels to prevent rock chips. I think all of these extra little things add up and is what makes Toyotas good reputation.","Tailgate assist, design of exterior, comfortable seats, nice responsive engine, quiet cabin, lots of storage compartments, interior has lots of head and leg room, sharp turn radius, bright headlights",2008,toyota,tundra,4

The van is large and spacious, similar to Odyssey, Sienna and Caravan (I've driven all of these). The performance is very good considering it's size, and you have to remember that it's a minivan, not a sports car. I think the build quality is good, not quite up to Sienna or Odyssey levels, but on par with the Caravan. The 5 year 60k mile warranty is a reassuring factor, but I have not yet had to take advantage of it. Also, I think gas mileage is pretty good, I get about 26 mpg on the highway, with a moderate load.","Fold down rear seats.

To our disappointment we have found that the wheels & hubs build up with snow, ice or mud which sets up an uncomfortable vibration Which can only be alleviated by washing the wheels thoroughly with a pressure washer.

The hatch is really great for hauling around stuff or for a guy with a family. The car has lost a little edge from the old one, but for my needs, it's for the better. I do recommend a 3M clear bra as the water based paint is still not as durable as it should be and rock chips WILL happen.

20035,04/08/2008,Sorentoville,7500 miles with this Sorento - feels comfortable to drive and has good visibility. In town mpg average is 15- 16 and best on the road at 65 MPH is 25. (accurately measured - not guessing). Most annoying though is the transmission. At 10-15 mph it stays locked in 5th gear and the vehicle will actually start to jump a little as this is too slow for this gear. Step on the gas and you aren't going anywhere in a hurry. The trans should shift itself down to match road speed.

When my last 2002 Odyssey bit the dust (after 220,000 miles) I decided to buy a car that would pay for itself because of improved gas mileage. After test driving a Civic, I realized I needed something with more interior space and focused on the Corolla instead. I found a great deal on a used 2009 LE, and have enjoyed it ever since. Very spacious inside (important, as I am tall as are my 4 sons) and great gas mileage. I do consistently about 38 miles per gallon on average and as such the car pays for itself (compared to my Honda). I only wish there was a remote trunk release and a horn beep when you remote lock the doors.

However, the seating position and lack of a dead pedal left me feeling very uncomfortable. The gas pedal is too close to the driver, which resulted in constantly lifting one's foot off the accelerator in order to properly control the throttle. Move the seat back too far and you can't reach the clutch and steering wheel. Also the lack of a dead pedal (or even a flat spot), leaves one's foot on a round bump.

Suspension is much nicer and acceleration is super smooth. I never thought I'd ever switch to a Japanese SUV for fear that it's not roomy enough for my family but I'm sure glad now.

Not your grandfather's Buick! Will help bring quality reputation back to the marque.","Quiet, quiet and smooth. Roomy comfortable front seats. Every feature you could want at hand. Lots of storage everywhere. Like the captain's chairs in back, and even the third row is suprisingly comfortable. Everything folds down fast and easy for carrying things. A great-looking car.",2008,buick,enclave,4
22034,01/15/2008,Chevys Lemon,My Silverado 1500 Classic has already had to have the rotors and drums turned! What has happened to Chevy's quality? It took the dealership-2 tries to even figure out what was going on. In town driving only--it has the tow pkg--which I don't use. The mpg is horrible. Have been a Chevy family for a long time but no more.,Comfy ride. Dual climate controls.,2007,chevrolet,silverado 1500 classic,2
3927,04/07/2008,SLE,"2008 Rallye Sport in black looks very sharp! Sticked for about 22,500, but jeep gave me 2,500 back, a generous trade and I under 5% financing, so... So far, very good. Good pep with a 5 speed manual and good gas mileage (24- 28 is pretty accurate). GREAT Boston Acoustics sound system (I have the 9 speaker system including flip down tailgate speakers). Interior look average, exterior look pretty sharp. Handles and drives very well. Good roomy interior (compared to my small sedan, so...) Drawbacks: cheap looking dash, but simple and logical; no MP3 jack on the 6 CD changer stereo; hatchback side windows don't crack open","Stereo is very good; good gas mileage for a vehicle that doesn't feel small; Some review say this car is Ugly, but I think it looks sharp.

418,05/12/2008,LakebearOH,"I thought I would keep my Honda CR-V forever. It was 10 years old but I didn't like anything else out there (including the new ones). Sat in the SX4 Crossover at the Auto Show in Cleveland and fell in love. I'm getting 28 MPG driving back and forth to work. I do wish it had a bigger gas tank because with the miles I drive (over 400 a week) I have to fill up twice a week, but otherwise I love this car. It is quieter than my Honda and rides very nice. I've gotten quite a few complements on it and a lot of questions because there aren't many Suzuki dealerships in the area.","AWD, keyless entry and start, stereo and controls on the steering wheel",2008,suzuki,sx4,4
13660,04/19/2008,greg cain,"Over the past 9 years I have purchased 4 Toyota products and this one is by far the best. My last purchase was a 2004 Highlander which my wife and I really enjoyed. You can't beat the overall performance of the engine and transmission. It actually feels like the vehicle is not running and at the same time just wants to take off. Outstanding performance. Ample room and at the same time, I can't see a whole lot of difference between this and the Highlander I owned. Our first choice was the Limited addition but chose the sport because of the darker seats and dash.","Looks, the storage in the rear, performance and Toyota quality. Not sure why everyone has to knock the back door. Putting the tire on the outside gives the RAV best in class in storage.",2008,toyota,rav4,5
8210,03/10/2008,Terry Swiers,"We had originally test drove the Vue to eliminate it from our list of vehicle options, just so we could say that we had actually looked at all of our options within the price range we set for ourselves. But instead of eliminating it, it moved to the top of the list. Of the vehicles that we looked at, the Vue Red Line was the only one that we walked away from the test drive with that ""gotta have it"" feeling. It had all the power we wanted, looked great, a smooth quiet ride, and it drove like it was on rails. If you are looking for a sporty compact SUV, don't dismiss the Vue Red Line until you have actually driven it.",Seat warmers that go all the way up the back. The advanced audio is just killer.

13249,01/24/2008,Rodmo1,"I only bought the car about ten days ago so it is much too early to comment on the reliability or long term comfort level of the interior. However, so far I really like the car. It is fun to drive and performs very well. As everyone else has already said the backseats are very small but I will always be sitting in the driver's seat so what does it matter? This is my first car. I have always owned trucks before but with the cost of gasoline and me living half way up a mountain I needed an efficient AWD. The Subaru fit the bill. My only fill up so far has resulted in 25.97 MPG which I imagine will only get better come engine break- in and non winter blend gas. Great car for the money!","AWD, fuel economy, appearance, expected reliability, trade in value.",2008,subaru,forester,4

I have used it for family vacations, football tailgating, commuting, hauling large items to the dump, taking the dog swimming, and kayak fishing. I plan to go camping in it this spring.

294,01/14/2009,Lindsey,Not only is this car beautiful from the outside it has a great interior. I live in a climate where it snows half of the year (basically) and I have never had a car that handles so well in the snow/ice. This car almost handles like a 4 wheel drive vehicle on the road at the worst of times. The Germans know how to make a great vehicle!,The extremely large trunk! I also love the heated exterior windows. But there really isn't one thing that I love more than the other. If you are a college student it's incredibly affordable and has a great residual value that is very attractive.,2008,volkswagen,jetta,5
19924,11/20/2007,Michael T,"I bought this truck to replace a 2003 Toyota Tacoma. I went with the TRD package because I love the look. I drive 90 miles a day so comfort and reliability are also very important. After reading several reviews I went with the 5.7L V8 and man am I glad. This truck is pure fun. The ride is smooth and comfortable. My wife doesn't want to drive her Expedition anymore! I'm not a big truck guy but this thing is perfect for people looking for the convenience of a truck and the ride of a car. The truck is big so people need to be aware that parking can be tight. With that said all I can say is, Toyota did it once again. Great job!",More interior storage than you can shake a stick at. Very quiet ride. The interior feels air tight. The standard stereo/CD player are great. Love that 5.7 V8! For a big truck it turns on a dime and the steering wheel feels effortless. Overall the truck just turns heads.,2007,toyota,tundra,5
16279,04/27/2007,Whitey,"Headed down to my Ford garage to buy my third Explorer, but really didn't want to face another 5 years of sub 20 MPG at $4.00 per gallon. Dealer suggested trying the new Edge. After trial, bought one. I have owned it for about one month and I like it. It is the only vehicle I have ever owned that people on the street turn and look at. My neighbors all came over to see the car that can drive on the edge of buildings. Haven't tried that yet. The suspension is much softer than the Explorer and other truck-based vehicles. This will take a while to get used to. I am hoping for average mileage North of 20 MPG. Too soon to tell.","It is surprising, but it has more interior cargo room than the Explorer.

I got it in Glacier Blue and it's so beautiful - in my opinion the best color this car comes in. I'm already averaging 27 mpg with highway/city driving. I love sitting up high and the visibility is so much better than my old sedan. This SUV handles and corners like a car, going down ramps with tight turns is no problem, however, it does lack in acceleration, but I've gotten used to that.

While it is not the same Tron-like driving experience, I could not ask for a more appropriate car for travelling with my family. It has all the space we need, decent mpg and is amazingly comfortable for short or long trips. We chose this over a SUV because the large trunk will keep items from hitting the kids if we are ever rear-ended.

From a driver's standpoint, I am having trouble getting used to a middle console. I miss the floor space in my minivan. I also do not care for the steering wheel. It doesn't adjust very much. I do love the adjustable gas pedal and brake pedal.

The only complaint I have is the rear brakes which seems to be a common complaint here. I will say this though, having had to replace the pads nearly every oil change, I will continue to pay for that hydraulic braking system.

This happens randomly and for no apparent reason. My only major complaint is the rear bumper. I think it is made poorly and within the first month I noticed a rock had hit the underside of the tire casing and made a notch in the paint. After closer inspection I noticed that there is another part where the paint is pulling away where the metal body and plastic bumper of the car meet.
